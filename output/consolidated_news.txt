Title: Restructuring Wondery: Amazon Exec Steve Boom on the Company’s Mission to Consolidate Podcasts and Focus on Celebrity-Led Titles

By Cynthia Littleton Business Editor In a crowded market, stars shine brightest. This was Amazon’s guiding principle in the restructuring of its audio entertainment operations. The company’s decision to consolidate aspects of its Wondery podcasting division with its larger Audible audio book division surprised the podcasting sector when the news broke on Aug. 4. Audible has been part of Amazon since 2008. Wondery, launched in 2016 by entrepreneur Hernan Lopez, was acquired in late 2020. In the five years since, podcasting has exploded as a medium, seeing in particular a big boom in video-enhanced programming. That growth spurt spurred Amazon to make structural shifts at Wondery and Audible. Related Stories Trump Says He May Use National Guard for L.A. Olympics Security in 2028 Trump to Lead Federal Task Force for 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games “This was definitely a strategic decision,” Steve Boom, Amazon’s VP of audio, Twitch and games, tells Variety. “As we’ve seen how the market has evolved and how we need to best organize to address the market opportunity where we’re seeing the most success, it became pretty apparent to us over the last several months. This acceleration of video podcasting is really what prompted this restructuring.” Popular on Variety Boom says the moves were spurred by the clear bifurcation that Amazon audio leaders began to see in Wondery’s output. Many of the platform’s most popular titles fell into one of two broad categories: narrative-driven and personality-centric. Narrative titles tend to be deeply reported productions focused on true crime, history, pop culture, investigative reports and, increasingly, kid-centric shows. Personality-focused shows include such high-profile titles as Dax Shepard’s “Armchair Expert,” Travis and Jason Kelce’s “New Heights” and LeBron James’ upcoming “Mind the Game” series. Tom Webster, a partner in the podcast trade organization Sounds Profitable, says Amazon’s reorg is right in line with the larger trends in podcasting. “So much of the current narrative in podcasting is really being driven by video, even though most consumers spent most of their time with audio only,” Webster says. “But for the biggest shows, they want to see LeBron. They want to see the Kelce brothers.” Over time, Amazon brass realized that the two kinds of podcast required different approaches to development, marketing and audience retention support. With the restructuring, Wondery’s narrative titles will be added to the vast archive of programs available under Audible’s subscription platform. Wondery’s focus will turn to the care and feeding of its celebrity- and personality-fronted shows. “We’ve learned over time that the business models for these two different types of content are actually quite different,” Boom tells Variety. “On the one hand, the video-creator podcasts are monetizing incredibly well through advertising. It’s a very, very strong advertising business. In contrast, with the narrative podcasts, we’ve come to the conclusion that those are best monetized through a premium business model. And it turns out that we have in Amazon the leading company in the world in premium spoken word modernization. So we decided that if the best business model [for narrative shows] is premium, then it makes sense to bring these two things into one place where we can actually monetize them appropriately.” Wondery ranks high among the most popular podcast platforms in the country. But as the overall podcast marketplace became increasingly crowded in the post-pandemic years, Wondery looked to differentiate itself with both volume of production and starry names. More recently, ESPN and other networks are turning to video podcasts as low-cost content options that ideally become a daily or weekly habit with viewers. “Video has grown much more quickly than audio-only over the last two or three years. And within the video segment, you have some that are really premium in terms of production values and the quality of the talent and the guests on the shows,” Boom says. “So there’s more and more content out there to consume. Even though the overall audience for podcasting is growing, with that much growth in [the volume of] content, you have a very uneven environment where some shows are growing their audiences, others are flat and others are down.” Amazon’s audio tune-up will result in about 100 layoffs within Wondery. Many staffers will move to new positions within Amazon. Jen Sargent, who has been CEO of Wondery for the past four years, will exit the company after a transition period. Boom stresses that Sargent has been “a phenomenal leader,” for Wondery. “Sometimes the market changes, and you have to respond to those changes,” he added.

Title: Bitcoin’s $404 mln outflows vs. Ethereum’s 15-week inflow streak: What’s going on?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoins-404-mln-outflows-vs-ethereums-15-week-inflow-streak-whats-going-on/
Time Published: 2025-08-05T19:00:48Z
Full Content:
Will Fed policy continue to trigger sell-offs? Digital assets saw $223 million in outflows, ending a 14-week streak. Bitcoin bore the brunt, while Ethereum continued to attract inflows. Digital asset investment products recorded $223 million in net outflows during the week ending the 2nd of August, the first pullback after 14 straight weeks of inflows. Source: CoinShares The week began strong with $883 million in inflows, but investor sentiment shifted quickly as the total crypto market cap fell 9.48%, erasing approximately $370 billion. The trigger? A hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve tone. The sell-off was triggered by U.S. investors reacting to a hawkish Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) report, which stated that, “Inflation remains somewhat elevated.” Following the report, U.S. investors offloaded $383 million worth of digital asset products, pushing the month-to-date outflow to $974 million, just shy of the $1 billion mark. Investors from Germany, Sweden, and Brazil also contributed to the sell-off, collectively dumping $81 million worth of crypto products. Source: CoinShares Bitcoin [BTC] accounted for the bulk of outflows, recording $404 million in net losses, almost halving its month-to-date outflow of $844 million. Sui [SUI] and Litecoin [LTC] saw relatively minor outflows of just $1 million each. Ethereum [ETH], on the other hand, remained an outlier. It recorded its 15th consecutive week of inflows, adding $133.9 million, suggesting a shift in investor preference toward Ethereum over Bitcoin. Meanwhile, investor interest in Solana [SOL], Ripple [XRP], and Cardano [ADA] added another $41 million in cumulative inflows. While most institutional investors exited their Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) positions, BlackRock took the opposite approach. The firm’s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum iShares ETFs recorded inflows of $355.3 million and $394.2 million, respectively, suggesting that BlackRock views both assets as trading at a discount. However, the wider institutional sentiment didn’t mirror this move. The week began with a significant sell-off. Source: CoinGlass According to CoinGlass, $323.5 million worth of Bitcoin spot ETFs were sold in the past day alone. The Ethereum spot ETF segment saw an even steeper withdrawal—its single-largest one-day outflow yet. Continued selling pressure like this signals a broad divestment trend that could weigh on the prices of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Still, the market’s longer-term outlook remains intact. The total assets under management (AUM) for digital asset products remain steady at $215 billion, suggesting that this could be a temporary pullback rather than a long-term reversal.

Title: BlackRock Deposits $372,000,000 Worth of Ethereum and $292,000,000 in Bitcoin to Coinbase Prime: On-Chain Data

The world’s largest asset manager has deposited hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) into Coinbase Prime, on-chain data shows. According to the blockchain tracking platform Lookonchain, BlackRock recently moved massive amounts of ETH and BTC worth a combined $664 million to the top US crypto platform as Trump’s latest tariff policies and new US jobs data have sparked market volatility. “BlackRock (ETHA) deposited 101,975 ETH ($372 million) and 2,544 BTC ($292 million) into Coinbase Prime [Tuesday].” The on-chain data indicate that the assets are from BlackRock’s Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), and its Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). It’s unclear the reason for the transfers, but it may indicate an intention to sell on behalf of clients. BlackRock uses Coinbase Prime for custody, sales and other services. The asset manager moved the Bitcoin in batches of 300 BTC and it moved Ethereum in multiple 10,000 ETH transactions. Meanwhile, Lookonchain reports institutional accumulation sprees of Ethereum have been surging. “Whales/institutions keep buying ETH! Another three fresh wallets bought 63,837 ETH ($236 million) via FalconX and Galaxy Digital OTC (over the counter) [Monday]. Since July 9th, a total of 14 fresh wallets have accumulated 856,554 ETH ($3.16 billion).” Lookonchain also notices ETH Treasury firm SharpLink added more Ethereum to its books this week. “SharpLink bought another 18,680 ETH ($66.63 million) [Monday]. SharpLink currently holds 498,711 ETH ($1.81 billion).” Bitcoin is trading for $113,012 at time of writing, down 1.8% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, ETH is trading for $3,578 at time of writing, down 2.2% on the day.

Title: How To Tap The AI Nuclear Bonanza For 10%+ Dividends

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. The AI boom still has plenty of room to run—but investing purely in AI stocks is not the best way to tap into it. NVIDIA (NVDA) and friends yield next to nothing! And these are crowded trades. Luckily for us, there’s another way to get in. Bargains are still available in the corner of the market we’ll get into below—as are 10%+ dividends. It’s all tied into AI’s voracious appetite for electricity. Yes, utilities are part of this play, but we want to go a little bit deeper and zero in on stocks specifically tied into nuclear power. We’re going to tap into those through high-yield closed-end funds (CEFs) that both trade at discounts and send huge payouts our way, too. Let me explain. It’s been about a month since the Wall Street Journal reported on President Trump’s plans to expand nuclear power in the US. The story went mostly unnoticed, but it’s an important one because it’s a multi-year plan that has bipartisan—and indeed non-political—support. For a couple of years now, tech companies have been pushing for more nuclear power. Alphabet (GOOGL) has been investing billions into nuclear-power companies such as Kairos Power and Elementl Power, while Amazon poured $500 million into X-Energy to build up nuclear capacity. AI, and its near-bottomless power demand, are behind these moves. And since AI is now transforming the American workplace and boosting productivity, the debate over whether this tech is a flash in the pan or here to stay is settled: It’s here to stay. Back in September 2020 (i.e., long before ChatGPT was released), I wrote in my CEF Insider advisory that one needs to invest widely to benefit from the technology, since it can produce efficiencies in circuitous ways: “Some companies, like insurance firms, will profit from artificial intelligence as this technology improves underwriting, lowers risk and improves health outcomes for patients.” The growing attention that nuclear power is getting is a prime example of this circuitous, second- and third-order benefit from AI playing out. Since AI is power-hungry, electricity and infrastructure suppliers serving the growing nuclear-power business will benefit. You might be thinking, “Okay, but how do I actually ride this wave?” Well, as I mentioned off the top, we need to look further afield than the NVIDIAs of the world to capture these higher-order effects of AI. That’s where utilities come in: Higher energy demand is a clear win for utilities, yet in the three years since ChatGPT and its range of copycats have been released, the utilities sector, shown in orange above by the performance of the benchmark Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU), has returned just 25%, less than half the broader market. That tells us the sector as a whole is still undervalued. And it also means buying XLU is still on the table as a way to capture the growing power (and specifically nuclear-power) demand AI is creating. But XLU isn’t the only play, and it’s hardly the best. As an index fund, it gets us broad exposure to the utilities sector, but broad isn’t what we want with something like AI, which is being brought in unevenly throughout the country. We want something a bit more tactical to target where the demand is hottest. A more active approach, like that of a CEF called the Gabelli Utility Trust (GUT), fits the bill here. The fund holds firms like WEC Energy (WEC), which is looking at expanding nuclear power production in Wisconsin, and Constellation Energy (CEG), owner of the largest collection of nuclear plants in the US. Plus, with its 10.7% yield, GUT is a much better income provider than 2.8%-yielding XLU. Plus, over the long haul, GUT (in orange above) has closely tracked XLU’s total returns, so we’re not sacrificing performance for income here. However, there are two snags with this fund. First, if GUT is just tracking the index, it isn’t outperforming and thus we can’t expect it to be tactical enough to benefit from the AI boom more than an index fund would. Plus, the fund is far from a bargain. GUT currently trades at a 96.2% premium to NAV. That’s the second-highest premium in the CEF world, and it means investors are paying nearly $2 for every $1 of assets! And, as we saw last year, that premium can disappear fast, causing big losses in the short term, as well. So, while GUT has done a good job transforming utilities’ profits into income, its premium and its historical performance suggest it isn’t the way to go for us. So instead, let’s look at another CEF, the 10.1%-yielding Voya Infrastructure Industrials and Materials Fund (IDE), which trades at a 4% discount to NAV. As the name says, the fund holds key infrastructure suppliers like Siemens AG, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Schneider Electric SE, all of which stand to gain from an AI-driven infrastructure buildout, including on the nuclear front. Not only is IDE a lot cheaper than GUT, it’s also outperformed it on a total-NAV-return basis (based on its underlying portfolio, not its sentiment-driven market price) over the last three years. With a slightly higher total NAV return, IDE’s management has proven they know where to put money to get returns, and the fund’s lower volatility is attractive, too. Without big swings in its asset value, like GUT saw in 2023, IDE hasn’t had to sell assets at a loss to maintain its payouts. Additionally, the fact that IDE has beaten GUT over the last three years on a total-NAV-return basis, suggests it is being more tactical and benefiting more from the AI boom. That makes it more than worth your attention as a place to invest as nuclear demand rises in the long term. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Peter Thiel-backed Bullish IPO may hit $4.2B valuation: Will it match Circle’s breakout?

Bullish wants to go public. But its timing, partners and ambitions reveal something much bigger! Crypto exchange Bullish has filed for a $629 million IPO at a $4.2 billion valuation. This has piqued the interest of BlackRock and ARK, who may buy $200 million worth of shares. Cryptocurrency exchange Bullish, backed by billionaire investor Peter Thiel, has officially entered the IPO arena with the filing of its F-1 registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company plans to offer 20.3 million ordinary shares at a price range of $28 to $31, potentially raising up to $629 million. If fully subscribed, the IPO could value the firm between $3.8 billion and $4.2 billion. The filing follows Bullish’s earlier confidential submission in June, a common route that allows firms to quietly prepare for listing while keeping key financials under wraps until the final stages. Bullish’s IPO push, with JPMorgan and Jefferies as lead underwriters, comes at a time when digital assets are regaining momentum and investor sentiment is shifting positively. This also aligns with Circle Internet Group’s impressive public debut, where shares of the USDC stablecoin issuer soared over 500%, highlighting growing market appetite for crypto firms. Bullish appears to be capitalizing on this momentum, kicking off its IPO roadshow shortly after the U.S. passed the GENIUS Act. This newly introduced but still untested law offers clearer regulatory pathways for stablecoin issuers. CEO Tom Farley addressed this backdrop in a letter included with the filing, saying, “We now intend to IPO because we believe that the digital assets industry is beginning its next leg of growth. We view transparency and compliance as hallmarks of how we operate Bullish, and believe those values align well with the public capital markets.” Major investment firms like BlackRock and ARK Investment Management have expressed interest in buying up to $200 million of Bullish shares, according to the updated F-1 filing. The Bullish IPO is part of a broader wave of ambitions in crypto. Major exchanges like OKX, Kraken, and Gemini are also signaling readiness to go public, with Gemini having already submitted a confidential filing. Meanwhile, Bitcoin [BTC] maxi Michael Saylor continues to double down on his crypto thesis through his firm Strategy Inc. (formerly MicroStrategy) via a Wall Street IPO to fund further Bitcoin purchases.

Shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) slumped after the drugmaker announced a Phase 2 trial of its experimental pain medicine missed a key goal, and that it would no longer continue its development. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and other chipmakers slid when President Donald Trump said in an interview he would be announcing new semiconductor tariffs soon. Axon Enterprise (AXON) shares took off when the Taser maker exceeded earnings and revenue estimates and boosted its outlook on strong demand for its security products. DuPont (DD) also raised its guidance as it lowered its estimate for how much tariffs would impact full-year earnings. In addition, the chemical and materials maker reported better-than-expected results, and shares gained.

Δ This arrangement, announced in a news release Tuesday (Aug.) will see funds and accounts managed by BlackRock advisors invest up to $1 billion through LendingClub’s marketplace programs through next year. Clarke Roberts, senior vice president and general manager for Marketplace at LendingClub, called the partnership “an exciting step forward” for his company. “It also validates the strength of our underwriting, the effectiveness of our marketplace programs, and the trust we’ve earned as a counterparty of choice in this asset class,” Roberts said in the release. “We want to thank BlackRock for their collaboration and execution, and we look forward to growing this partnership over time.” This collaboration comes on the heels of BlackRock’s first transaction of $100 million under LendingClub’s new LENDR (LendingClub Rated Notes) program, which closed in June. LENDR offers “multiple tranches, each with a credit rating from Fitch,” the release added. Under the June transaction with BlackRock, all tranches were sold to funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. In all, LendingClub has sold close to $6 billion in loans through its structured certificates programs since their launch in 2023. PYMNTS spoke in June with LendingClub CEO Scott Sanborn, who argued that as high-income Americans struggle with debt, the solution is rewarding people for using the money they actually have rather than extending more credit. “We’re saying that if rewards are important to you, that’s great, so let’s reward you for good behavior,” Sanborn told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster as LendingClub introduced its LevelUp Checking service. That program offers customers 2% cash back for on-time loan payments made from the account and 1% cash back when using the associated debit card for qualifying purchases. As that report noted, the reliance on credit is not confined to lower-income brackets, as illustrated by LendingClub’s target customer for LevelUp Checking. These are people individuals with a high FICO score, typically around 725, and a higher-than-average individual income, somewhere in the range of $125,000 to $130,000. “These consumers often have enough money to afford things but lack the immediate cash to pay for them outright,” Sanborn said, making them more likely to carry larger-than-average car loans, student loans, mortgages and significant credit card debt. During an earnings call last week, Sanborn said that LevelUp Checking had driven a six-fold increase in the number of checking accounts opened each day since its launch in June.

Title: Pomerantz Law Firm Announces the Filing of a Class Action Against iRobot Corporation and Certain Officers – IRBT

August 05, 2025 10:00 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct.

Title: Built To Last: Why Skilled Trades Are Surviving The AI Disruption

ByTim Bajarin ByTim Bajarin, Contributor. For most of my career, when asked to speak to high school students or incoming first-year college students and give them career advice, I mostly steered them towards a career in technology. I would talk about how I saw tech jobs driving the future, especially in IT, programming, security, and areas that would be important to tech infrastructure. Looking back, given that today AI has threatened the jobs of millions of white-collar tech workers, I should have also recommended another option that looks like perhaps a safer bet: blue-collar jobs. When I was in high school in the late 1960s, one of the more interesting programs offered separate trade school specialties. My high school provided programs for auto repair, electricians, HVAC, and plumbing. At the time, as a certified geek, I did not appreciate these programs in my high school and their potential as a significant career opportunity for many in my class. But decades of watching manufacturing jobs disappear overseas and being told the future belonged to knowledge workers, America's blue-collar workforce may be one of the safest careers to have. As artificial intelligence threatens to automate away millions of white-collar positions, the very trades that were once dismissed as "dead-end jobs" are emerging as the economy's most recession-proof careers. While ChatGPT can write code, analyze spreadsheets, and even draft legal briefs, it can’t fix your broken air conditioner on a sweltering August afternoon or rewire the electrical systems that power our AI-driven economy. As a homeowner, I have come to appreciate the skills of plumbers, electricians, and other blue-collar workers I call on often for various issues, such as replacing my water heater, drainage problems, and roof leaks.In my teen years, I worked on cars and even took a dedicated auto class. But today, if my car has a problem, I go to a skilled mechanic to fix any issue that arises. A recent Microsoft analysis examining AI-resistant jobs reveals the scope of this economic reversal. The 40 most vulnerable occupations—translators, historians, sales representatives, and other desk-bound professionals—employ roughly 11 million Americans. Meanwhile, the 40 least vulnerable positions—heavy equipment operators, roofers, electricians, and similar hands-on roles—currently employ about 5.5 million workers. Mike Rowe, the "Dirty Jobs" host, captured this shift perfectly at a recent AI summit: “We’ve been telling kids for 15 years to code. 'Learn to code!’ we said. Yeah, well, AI's coming for the coders. They're not coming for the welders. They're not coming for the plumbers.” The irony of our AI revolution is that it requires massive physical infrastructure that only human hands can build and maintain. Every AI query runs on servers housed in data centers that need electricians, HVAC technicians, and construction workers. I once went into a central server farm in Oregon that needed massive air conditioning to cool the hundreds of servers running 24/7. The more we automate knowledge work, the more we need skilled tradespeople to keep the digital economy running. Companies are already boasting about saving hundreds of millions annually by replacing human workers with AI. But these companies also need the wiring for their new data centers or maintaining the cooling systems that prevent their AI servers from overheating, and they will acknowledge that they need these blue-collar workers to make that happen. The AI boom will only intensify this crunch as demand for data center construction and maintenance skyrockets. We will also need millions of people to manage these manufacturing lines in the future. A recent NPR article points out that the Manufacturing Institute (the NAM’s workforce development and education affiliate) and Deloitte, a consultancy firm, surveyed more than 200 manufacturing companies last year. More than 65% of the firms said recruiting and retaining workers was their No. 1 business challenge," NPR noted. "The Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte projected that the industry will need 3.8 million additional workers by 2033 and that as many as '1.9 million of these jobs could go unfilled if workforce challenges are not addressed.'" I believe there needs to be a reimagining of the workforce development. Programs like the Manufacturing Institute’s maintenance technician training, now operating in 16 states, show what’s possible. Early graduates average an income of $95,000 annually within five years—compensation that rivals many traditional white-collar careers without the student debt burden. The world is learning in real time that AI is a transformational technology that brings with it new needs, particularly when it comes to U.S. infrastructure and our electrical grid. America might not be producing enough electricians to build and service the data centers that power AI. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says he has "told the members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians as we build out AI data centers. We just don’t have enough." These centers are a critical part of building America's leadership in AI. For decades, American culture has pushed college as the only path to middle-class prosperity while stigmatizing manual labor as somehow lesser work. This cultural bias persists even as plumbers and electricians often out-earn college graduates saddled with student loans. The AI revolution may finally force a long-overdue reckoning with these assumptions. When artificial intelligence can write legal briefs but can't unclog a drain, maybe it's time to reconsider which skills are truly valuable in the modern economy. One big question asked of tech CEOs is whether they are willing to help retrain many of their tech workers who will lose jobs to AI. As of now, I have seen no dedicated programs coming from tech companies that offer any transitional programs, especially towards blue-collar careers that could be just as lucrative as the white collar programs today. I suspect this transition won’t happen automatically. It requires coordinated effort from employers, educational institutions, and policymakers to create pathways for mid-career workers displaced by AI to retrain for skilled trades. The infrastructure exists—apprenticeship programs, community college partnerships, and industry training initiatives—but it needs to be massively scaled. As artificial intelligence transforms the American workforce, one truth is emerging: the future will favor not those who mimic machines, but those who offer what machines can't—deeply human skills. In a world racing toward automation, this is a powerful reminder that some roles still demand the irreplaceable human touch.

Title: Against The Grain: Analyst Targets $300K Bitcoin Price—When Will It Happen?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A well-known Bitcoin analyst is charting a path that most traders don’t expect. According to reports, the pseudonymous quant strategist PlanB told his 216,000 YouTube subscribers he believes Bitcoin will climb to at least $300,000 by the end of 2026. That’s a bold call, given that 60% of market participants think the world’s largest cryptocurrency won’t hit that mark in just one and a half years. Based on his stock-to-flow model, PlanB says Bitcoin’s built-in scarcity drives long-term value. He argues the model points toward an average of $500,000 per coin after the next halving. The stock-to-flow setup gives a wide range—from $250,000 at the low end to $1 million at the high end—but PlanB believes the center of that range is where Bitcoin is headed. His view flips the script on most forecasts today. The analyst is also keeping an eye on Bitcoin’s realized price. This metric looks at the price at which recent cohorts of coins last moved on-chain, then divides by the total supply. Since the current market price of $114,150—up 1% on the day—sits above every major cohort band, PlanB sees a classic bull-market pattern with no bear-market warning signs in sight. Based on data from price-forecast services, Bitcoin may average $112,000 this month of August, peaking near $114,800 and dipping to around $109,000. For September 2025, forecasts narrow to a band between $111,000 and $112,400, with an average close to $111,7002. Into 2026, some models see steady gains toward $194,000 by December, with highs above $225,000. According to market watchers, Anthony Scaramucci expects Bitcoin to top $170,000 within the next year. US President Donald Trump has not weighed in on crypto recently. Cathie Wood has her sights on $1 million per coin over the next five years. Digital Coin Price forecasts a swing to about $119,860 by mid-August 2025, then longer-term gains into the $210,000–$230,000 range during 2025. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor, Strategy Chairman, says Bitcoin’s limited supply and growing institutional interest could push it to $10 million, sparking fresh debate over its long-term role as a global asset. Based on analysis, investors should remember that models are tools, not guarantees. PlanB’s $300,000 call sits at the optimistic end of the spectrum. Others see more modest moves, while some have even larger long-term hopes. Whether Bitcoin follows its past cycles or breaks new ground, it’s clear the debate over its next big run is only getting started. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

August 05, 2025 08:41 ET | Source: Grabar Law Office Grabar Law Office PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC): Grabar Law Office is investigating claims on behalf of shareholders of Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC). The investigation concerns whether certain officers and directors breached the fiduciary duties they owed to the company. If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085 to learn more. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. WHY? As alleged in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint, Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) provided investors with material information concerning Centene’s expected revenue guidance and adjusted diluted EPS for fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s enrollment and morbidity rates, as well as strong retention rates in Centene’s Medicare business. The Complaint alleges that Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Centene’s enrollment and morbidity rates. The Complaint claims that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Centene’s securities at artificially inflated prices. WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW: If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. If, alternatively, you purchased your shares between December 12, 2024, and June 30, 2025, you can participate in the class action. $CNC #Centene DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV): Grabar Law Office is investigating whether certain officers and directors of DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company. If you have held DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) shares since prior to November 10, 2023, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV), via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV) shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever. If you would like to learn more about this matter, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. $DV #DoubleVerify Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) Shareholder Class Action Survives Motion to Dismiss: If you are a Current Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) shareholder who has held Napco shares since prior to November 7, 2022, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. Click here to join or learn more: https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. Why? Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085.

Visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/treace-shareholder-investigation/, or contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com or call 267-507-6085 to learn more. Why? A recently filed securities class action complaint alleges that, Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMCI), via certain of its officers, made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Complaint alleges Defendants failed to disclose that: (1) competition impacted the demand for and utilization of its primary product, the Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction System; (2) as a result, Treace Medical’s revenue declined, and the Company needed to accelerate its plans to offer a product that served as an alternative to osteotomy (a surgical procedure involving the cutting and realignment of a bone to improve its position or function); and (3) Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current Treace shareholders who have held Treace shares since prior to May 8, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever.

Title: Viral RNA-Based Sprays For Plants Have Unknown Consequences

A Masterstroke of Economic and Geopolitical Brilliance by Rhoda Wilson | Aug 5, 2025 | Headline News | 0 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at Natural News. Terrana Biosciences is on a mission to replace pesticides with its RNA-based sprays as “vaccines” for plants to protect crops from pests and diseases. The RNA is taken from plant viruses. Terrana claims its sprays do not alter the plant genome and merely deliver RNA into plants to stimulate an immune response or produce protective proteins. But in reality, they don’t know, as there have been no long-term safety studies. The company describes its products as: “Terrana sources native RNAs from across the plant world and gives them new instructions to make any desired trait and solve for problems at any point in the plant’s lifecycle,” which indicates their true aim. Michelle Perro explains why Terrana’s sprays are risky, very risky, for people and the environment. RNA sprays are more dangerous than GMO crops, she says. Related: The architects of Moderna’s mRNA shots are plotting to spray RNA on your food, Natural News. 25 July 202 Terrana Biosciences was launched by the venture capital firm Flagship Pioneering on 1 July 2025. At the end of July, reports were circulating that the company had received approval to spray synthetic RNA onto American food crops. The reports (for example, see HERE and HERE) don’t provide their sources for the approval, so we haven’t been able to verify these claims. However, in December 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) approved ledprona, a sprayable double-stranded ribonucleic acid pesticide. Marketed as Calantha, which uses ledprona as its active ingredient, the RNA interference (“RNAi”) pesticide was developed by GreenLight Biosciences. Perhaps the July reports are conflating the launch of Terrana Biosciences and the approval of GreenLight’s RNA products? Regardless, the whole agenda of replacing chemicals with RNA products is nefarious. Table of Contents GreenLight Biosciences, founded in 2008 and based in Massachusetts, is a biotechnology company that uses RNA technology to develop sustainable solutions for agriculture and human health. “In Rochester, New York, we are operating the world’s largest RNA factory,” the company boasts. It has received US regulatory approval to sell its RNAi pesticide for the Colorado potato beetle, Calantha, and is awaiting approval for Norroa, an RNAi product to “protect honeybees” from varroa mites. In December 2024, GreenLight announced the establishment of GreenLight Biosciences México, S. de R.L. de C.V., expanding its operations to Brazil and Mexico. “Among the innovative technologies to be introduced are a novel adjuvant that improves crop protection performance and Norroa,” the company said. This year, GreenLight has received substantial funding. In March 2025, the company announced a $25 million investment from Just Climate. Just Climate was established in 2021 by Generation Investment Management as a “specialist investment business focused on scaling solutions for the highest-emitting, most off-track sectors of the economy.” Generation Investment Management is an investment management firm founded in 2004 by former US Vice President Al Gore and former Goldman Sachs’ Asset Management head David Blood, along with five other partners. According to a report in 2017, the company had US$18 billion under management and was based in London with an office in San Francisco. At the time, the company employed 100 people. According to Wikipedia, it has partnerships with the following: “[Just Climate’s] investment enables the company to continue its expansion across key international markets, including Brazil and other Latin American countries. Recent expansion efforts include the establishment of a state-of-the-art Agricultural Research Station in Seville, Spain, which now serves as the Company’s European hub for innovation and collaborative research in sustainable agriculture practices,” GreenLight Biosciences said. In February 2025, the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) provided a €35 million loan to GreenLight Biosciences Spain to “support research and production of ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi)-based biocontrols.” RNAi-based “biocontrols” (i.e. pesticides) “constitute a sustainable alternative to traditional chemical pesticides,” EIB said. Adding, “The EIB loan will support GreenLight Bio’s RDI programmes associated with the research, registration, and production of a pipeline of ten products to be launched in the EU … The loan will also finance the research and innovation centre of Greenlight Biosciences in Seville, Spain.” Now read the Globalist propaganda GreenLight uses to push its gene editing products. Note the use of the phrase “nature-based pest control” and “environmentally friendly.” It is an outright lie to claim that gene manipulation is “nature-based” or “environmentally friendly.” “At GreenLight Biosciences, we believe that providing farmers with nature-based pest control solutions is key to building a more sustainable and resilient food supply chain. Our platform is not only environmentally friendly but also offers farmers an effective and safe alternative to traditional pesticides,” stated GreenLight Biosciences Chief Strategy Officer & co-founder Marta Ortega-Valle. “With the support of the European Investment Bank, we can expand our efforts to bring these innovative solutions to farmers across Europe.” Spain: EIB finances GreenLight Biosciences with €35 million to invest in research and production of RNA-based biological pesticides, European Investment Bank, 3 February 2025 According to the company profile on Investing, GreenLight Biosciences is also involved in human health, with “a phase I/II preclinical stage vaccine for COVID-19 and candidate selection vaccines for shingles and oncology.” We previously noted Flagship Pioneering in our article ‘UK’s plan to be a “science and technology superpower” progresses; dystopia looms’. In this article, we quoted a Department for Science, Innovation & Technology policy paper which said: US Venture Capital firm Flagship Pioneering announced its strategic commitment to the UK life sciences ecosystem in 2023 and established its first base outside of the US in London. This was marked by the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the UK government … This commitment was combined with Flagship’s milestone launch of Quotient Therapeutics, the first Flagship-founded company co-anchored in the UK and US. Innovation, investment and growth in life sciences – applying the Science and Technology Framework to one of the UK’s strongest sectors, The UK Science and Technology Framework: update on progress (9 February 2024), Department for Science, Innovation & Technology, 9 February 2024 In our 2021 article ‘Building an Empire – The United Nations Using the World Economic Forum to Roll Out Its Agenda’, we noted that “the top institutional shareholders of Moderna are Baillie Gifford & Company, and Flagship Pioneering Inc. (founded by Noubar Afeyan) followed by Vanguard, Blackrock and Morgan Stanley.” In an article last year, ‘Moderna’s influence over the US and UK governments is more than most realise’, we noted: “Flagship Pioneering are a venture capital firm that financed and kickstarted Moderna. The CEO of Flagship Pioneering, Noubar Afeyan, also co-founded Moderna. So, they’re essentially one and the same.” Wikispooks notes that “after Noubar Afeyan and Robert Langer, [Stéphane] Bancel is the largest individual shareholder in [Moderna].” So, who is Flagship Pioneering? Founded in 1999 by Noubar Afeyan and Ed Kania under the name NewcoGen, it was later renamed Flagship Ventures and then Flagship Pioneering in 2016. The company has originated and fostered more than 100 companies since its launch in 2000, resulting in over $60 billion in aggregate value. According to its LinkedIn profile, “The current Flagship ecosystem comprises over 40 companies.” You can see a list of these companies HERE, one of which is Moderna. In 2023, Flagship Pioneering established its first European base in London, marking a significant expansion into the UK life sciences sector. This move was followed by the launch of Quotient Therapeutics. At the beginning of this year, Flagship Pioneering partnered with Cambridge University Health Partners (“CUHP”) and the Milner Therapeutics Institute (MTI) to accelerate biotech research and innovation in the UK. You can see a list of Flagship’s numerous partners HERE, including ThermoFisher, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and GSK. In 2025, Flagship unveiled Terrana Biosciences. Forbes reported in 2021 that founder Noubar Afeyan owns at least 75% of Flagship Pioneering. By Michelle Perro, MD, as published by GMO Science on 31 July 2025 Terrana Biosciences, launched by Flagship Pioneering, the creator of Moderna, received a $50 million initial investment and government approval for experimental-use authorisations, raising ethical and public health alarms. The company pioneers RNA-based agricultural traits throughout a “proprietary technology platform.” The company claims that their approach will empower farmers with “… precise, adaptive solutions to combat threats to crops in fields and orchards and enhance resiliency, sustainability, and productivity in the global food system.” Is this an incredible breakthrough or more of the same rhetoric that we endured and heard spouted with genetically modified organisms (“GMOs”) that turned out to be an environmental and health disaster? Instead of modifying DNA, Terrana’s spray-on RNA platform delivers engineered RNA molecules through tiny tears in plant leaves; these enter plant cells, replicate and can express proteins such as viral antigens, insecticidal Cry toxins, or climate‑resilience genes designed to act as programmable plant vaccines. Thus, Terrana will use RNA from plant viruses as a chassis to carry pieces of “cargo RNA” into a plant to help it fight infections and insects, and deliver vaccines. The CEO of Terrana (and a Flagship partner), Ryan Rapp, says we should think of this “… like software. You can stick a floppy disk or USB drive into the computer and give it a set of instructions. This is the first time we’ve had a platform where we can actually do this in plants”. Terrana CEO Ryan Rapp: “We are giving humanity this other tool as we start to deal with climate change to help us deal with the effects on food supply and production.” ‘There are so many things we can do with this’… Terrana Biosciences to unleash RNA-based crop protection, Ag Tech Navigator, 3 July 2025 Kids aren’t software updates! Keep synthetic RNA off their plates. The approach by Terrana differs from those using RNA interference (“RNAi”) on crops. The EPA gave the green light to farmers in 2024 to use an RNAi insecticide from GreenLight Biosciences. When consumed by beetles, the RNA silences their survival gene. RNA sprays are deployed without long-term safety data on human exposure, children, or immune and reproductive effects. The technology remains unlabelled, and liability protections are in place under experimental regulatory frameworks. Terrana’s products fall under experimental authorisation, meaning neither Terrana nor government agencies bear liability for adverse outcomes. There is no mandatory labelling, so consumers cannot give informed consent or opt out. RNA molecules entering human food supplies may alter gut-associated lymphoid tissue (“GALT”), raising unknown immunological consequences in children. Repeat exposure could disrupt hormonal signalling, endocrine pathways or even transgenerational development (affecting our offspring), given RNA’s potential systemic persistence. Terrana claims some RNA constructs may be heritable across plant generations, raising an alarm about unintentional spread across species and ecosystems. This uncontrolled gene expression mirrors historically what we have witnessed with GMOs, only magnified by a sprayable, replicable system. The fight against GMOs has been an uphill battle, with industry and regulatory agencies suppressing public awareness despite mounting and censored scientific evidence of harm. This is the same pattern of secrecy and dismissal now repeating itself with the untested, unlabelled RNA spray technology being pushed onto our food and environment. The EPA has already approved RNA-based applications such as GreenLight’s RNAi spray in 2024. Terrana’s RNA is more advanced: it enters the plant interior and replicates, rather than merely coating leaves like earlier RNA sprays. Regulatory agencies have permitted early usage under experimental-use guidance, without labelling mandates and with pre-emption protections, shielding manufacturers from legal accountability. What Could Go Wrong? Terrana’s “software” approach to plants is far more dangerous than traditional GMOs because it bypasses genetic modification and instead reprogrammes plants in real-time, using synthetic RNA sprays that alter gene expression without leaving a clear genetic fingerprint. Unlike GMOs, which underwent lengthy (although faulty and imperfect) regulatory reviews and must be grown from modified seeds, RNA sprays can be applied repeatedly and directly onto crops, meaning gene expression can be continuously manipulated in the field. This creates a moving target for a safety evaluation. Be clear: there is no fixed genome to study, no long-term data, and no labelling for consumers. By treating plants like “computers” to be constantly re-coded, this technology risks unpredictable ripple effects on plant physiology, pollinators, and human health. Traditional GMOs were studied and showed harm, but were ignored by industry and the government. Terrana’s RNA sprays are the next unretrievable experimental, untested at scale, and stunningly released under legal immunity, which makes this approach a vast, uncontrolled genetic experiment in our food system, our health, and our environment. The effects of RNA sprays on our microbiome? Unknown. While Big Ag and Big Tech proponents tout RNA sprays as “climate‑responsive” innovations, the lack of long-term safety studies, the absence of labelling, and legal immunity represent an unchecked genetic experiment. Unlike GMOs subjected to years of oversight and litigation, this new platform bypasses those meagre safeguards entirely. As a physician, I urge readers and policymakers alike to demand transparency, full labelling, independent safety testing, especially assessing impacts on children’s immune and reproductive health, before allowing gene-altering sprays into our food system and environment. Approval? No. Moratorium. Michelle Perro, MD, is a veteran paediatrician with over four decades of experience in acute and integrative medicine, co-founder and CEO of GMOScience.

Investors yanked a staggering $465.1 million from spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Monday, marking the biggest one-day outflow since the cohort’s debut last year. The Monday outflows effectively ended their longest inflow streak. The recent run saw record-breaking activity, when the nine spot Ether ETFs trading in the US saw inflows of $2.2 billion in the second week of July, $1.9 billion in the third week, and $154.3 million just last week. BlackRock’s ETHA led Monday’s losses, shedding $375 million, while Fidelity’s FETH followed with a $55.1 million drop, according to UK asset manager Farside Investors. Not a single ETH ETF posted inflows on Monday, with multiple funds remaining flat for the day. Despite the recent outflows, the Ethereum ETFs have still collectively netted $9.02 billion in total inflows. Ethereum was recently trading at around $3,680 at press time as the broader crypto market saw a modest uptick. According to a recent report by Standard Chartered, corporations are now acquiring Ether at twice the rate of Bitcoin. Since the start of June, crypto treasury firms have scooped up approximately 1% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply, suggesting a growing institutional appetite for the second-largest cryptocurrency. On Monday, for instance, Peter Thiel-backed BitMine Immersion surpassed $3 billion in Ethereum, making it the largest corporate ETH treasury. According to the company’s official announcement, BitMine now ranks as the third largest public crypto treasury in the world, behind only Michael Saylor’s Strategy and miner Mara Blockchain, which both hold Bitcoin (BTC). BitMine, which aims to control 5% of all Ethereum held or staked, launched its strategy earlier this month. The Nasdaq-listed company said that it has achieved its 833,137 ETH stockpile in just 35 days. Standard Chartered stressed that such accumulation, coupled with steady inflows into US spot Ether ETFs, has been a key catalyst behind Ether’s recent upsurge. The British multinational bank thinks these trends could propel ETH beyond the $4,000 price threshold by year-end. Looking ahead, the bank forecasts that Ethereum treasury companies could eventually own as much as 10% of the entire supply, citing the added benefits of staking and decentralized finance (DeFi) participation.

Title: 78% Revenue Dependency = 0.7 Stock Correlation: How Klaviyo Became a Leveraged Bet on Shopify (And What It Means for Your SaaS Partnership Strategy)

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts When business partnerships go beyond handshake deals to create fundamental interdependence, their stock prices often move in lockstep—sometimes with surprising precision. In the world of public markets, few relationships are as telling as those between strategic business partners whose fates have become intertwined. While investors often focus on diversification to reduce risk, some stocks move together with such consistency that they effectively become leveraged bets on each other’s success. The relationship between e-commerce giant Shopify (SHOP) and marketing automation company Klaviyo (KVYO) offers a compelling case study in how deep business partnerships translate directly into correlated stock movements. Since Klaviyo’s initial public offering in September 2023, the two stocks have exhibited a correlation coefficient estimated between 0.6 and 0.7—a relationship strong enough that savvy investors treat them as almost a single position when building portfolios. The Shopify-Klaviyo relationship goes far beyond a typical vendor partnership. The numbers tell the story of true business interdependence: This level of integration creates what economists call “economic coupling”—where the success of one company becomes fundamentally tied to the performance of another. When Shopify’s merchant base grows, Klaviyo benefits directly. When Klaviyo develops better marketing tools, Shopify’s platform becomes more valuable to merchants. The correlation between these stocks becomes most apparent when examining their price movements since Klaviyo’s public debut: Klaviyo launched its IPO at $30 per share on September 20, 2023, closing its first trading day at $32.76—a respectable 9.2% gain. During this period, Shopify was trading in the $60-70 range, providing a stable backdrop for its partner’s market debut. Perhaps the clearest evidence of correlation came during the market downturn in mid-2024. Both stocks hit their respective 52-week lows within days of each other: This synchronized selling wasn’t coincidental. As broader economic concerns about small business spending and e-commerce growth emerged, investors fled both stocks simultaneously, recognizing that headwinds for one would inevitably impact the other. The correlation proved equally strong on the upside. Both stocks staged impressive recoveries into early 2025: This parallel recovery was driven by renewed optimism about e-commerce growth, AI integration, and the overall health of their shared ecosystem. While the correlation is strong, it’s notably asymmetric. Klaviyo, with its beta coefficient of 1.24, acts as a leveraged play on Shopify’s performance. This makes intuitive sense given the relationship dynamics: Why Klaviyo is More Sensitive: Shopify’s Buffer Factors: Despite the strong overall correlation, there are periods when the stocks diverge, typically during: For investors, understanding partner stock correlations offers both opportunities and warnings: Smart investors approach correlated partner stocks with specific strategies: The Shopify-Klaviyo case illustrates several important principles about partner stock correlations: Surface-level partnerships rarely create sustained stock correlations. But when companies become operationally interdependent—through revenue sharing, technology integration, or strategic ownership—their stock prices tend to move together consistently. The larger partner (Shopify) typically shows more stability, while the smaller partner (Klaviyo) exhibits amplified movements. This creates natural lead-lag relationships that sophisticated traders can exploit. Correlations often strengthen over time as the market better understands the business relationship. Early recognition of these dynamics can provide edge for perceptive investors. Several factors will determine whether the Shopify-Klaviyo correlation remains strong: The Shopify-Klaviyo relationship demonstrates that in today’s interconnected business landscape, strategic partnerships can create correlations as strong as those found within industry sectors. For investors, recognizing these relationships early—and understanding their asymmetric nature—can provide both opportunity and necessary caution. As businesses become increasingly specialized and interdependent, expect to see more examples of partner stock correlations. The key is identifying when partnerships have moved beyond contractual relationships to true economic coupling, where the success of one partner becomes fundamentally tied to the other’s performance. In the case of Shopify and Klaviyo, their correlation serves as a masterclass in how modern business partnerships translate directly into capital market dynamics—offering investors a clear example of how strategic alliances can drive stock price movements with remarkable consistency. The correlation between strategic partners’ stock prices reflects the underlying reality of modern business: in an interconnected economy, isolated success is increasingly rare, and the most important question isn’t whether companies will rise or fall together, but rather how amplified those movements will be.

After the Civil War, the German-born Jewish businessman Isidor Straus moved with his family to New York City. Straus was enterprising and handsome, with small round spectacles, an angular nose, and a coarse, peppery beard. He started off as a crockery vender; by the turn of the twentieth century, he had made millions as a co-owner of Macy’s, befriended Grover Cleveland, served a year in Congress, and fallen in love. His wife was Rosalie Ida Blun, with whom he shared a birthday and seven children. On April 10, 1912, Isidor and Ida boarded the Titanic. She would decline a lifeboat, refusing to be separated from her husband. In James Cameron’s 1997 film, they embrace each other in bed, weeping, as the ship sinks. “I like to imagine they were thinking, ‘This is going to be a movie, we need to get our screen time,’ ” their great-great-granddaughter, Mikaela Straus, told me, taking a hit of a blunt on her couch, in Brooklyn. The last of her line of inheritance had been spent long before she was born. She’s bemused by suppositions about the advantages of her family legacy, which in reality boasts a centuries-deep ledger of addiction, estrangement, and untimely death. Only twenty-six, Mikaela, under the moniker King Princess, has begun to establish a musical legacy all her own. Over the past decade, she’s cultivated a reputation for a new kind of defiant, autodidactic pop stardom. Next month, she will release her striking third album, “Girl Violence”—her best yet—which cements her status not only as a virtuosic provocateur but as a generational talent. When Straus was seventeen, she wrote and produced her first single, a lesbian pop song that would eventually go platinum. It was her first semester at U.S.C.’s Thornton School of Music, and she was showering in her dorm suite when she started to hum a new melody. She ran, naked and dripping wet, out of the bathroom, and frantically asked a roommate for their phone. Into it, she recorded the first few phrases of what would become “1950,” a snappy serenade to a crush that has since accrued over half a billion streams. Straus had grown up in a recording studio, where she’d developed a shrewd understanding of pop arithmetic. Blending the honeyed soul of old-school crooners with the synthesized beats that dominated the airwaves and dance floors of her adolescence, she introduced audiences to what would become the King Princess sound: sexy, plaintive vocals, thrumming bass lines, and a fusion of digital and analog instrumentation. Shortly after the release of “1950,” in February, 2018, Harry Styles posted the lyrics on Twitter, garnering hundreds of thousands of likes overnight. Straus would go on to perform the song on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” then on “Saturday Night Live.” What made “1950” ’s success unique was its refusal to conform to the expectations of a Billboard-charting ballad; in a swirl of doo-wop snaps and reverb, it told a defiant, elliptical ode to gay history. “I hate it when dudes try to chase me,” Straus sings, in a raspy alto: But I love it when you try to save me’Cause I’m just a ladyI love it when we play 1950So cold that your stare’s bout to kill meI’m surprised when you kiss me The chorus toys with the erotics of bygone danger—conflating the perils of mid-century homophobia with a modern lover’s desire to play hard to get. “I was just thinking about how sad it is that we, you know, are horny for our own oppression,” she quipped on a podcast. Straus, who knew she was queer before she could write her name, was a lonely child. Though her parents were largely supportive of her sexuality, others were not: when she walked down the streets of New York holding hands with girlfriends as a young teen-ager, passersby would hurl expletives, slurs, and occasional threats. For company, she turned to literature—Radclyffe Hall’s “The Well of Loneliness,” Rita Mae Brown’s “Rubyfruit Jungle,” Nella Larsen’s “Passing,” Fannie Flagg’s “Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe.” She particularly loved “The Price of Salt,” the only happy ending she encountered, and subsequently read every biography she could find of Patricia Highsmith and her lovers. She wrote the song as a way to reach across time toward them, to find a companion in history. That spring, the producer Mark Ronson heard Straus’s demos in an A. & R. meeting at Sony. They got dinner—a meeting she’s described wryly as a first date—and, struck by her raunch and then by her technical acumen, he signed her. (One of his favorite songs of hers is called “Pussy Is God.”) After Straus received an advance from Ronson’s imprint at Columbia Records, Zelig, one of the first things she did was pay off some forty thousand dollars in outstanding student loans. Her début EP, “Make My Bed,” opens with a prayer of thanks: “Eighteen years I spent / waiting for this.” In June, Straus told me how her time at the label ran its course. “We have enough documentaries about Britney Spears to know how it works,” she said, shrugging and packing her lip with Zyn, the nicotine pouches she’s substituted for a vaping addiction. She recalled how she and her mother—whom she jokes is the “D-list Kris Jenner”—had hired a lawyer to exegete every line of the contract for her, “and I still got fucked.” After seven years at Columbia, she left. “In L.A., I had become addicted to my own unhappiness. It reached a point where I was like, ‘I will die if certain things don’t change,’” she told me. “Mark was like a parent to me. He was gracious enough to let me go.” She made her new album, “Girl Violence,” free of oversight or contractual obligation, then scouted for distributors, landing with section1, the tiny partner label of the independent, Brooklyn-based Partisan Records. Their enthusiasm and compassion had surprised her. “I wasn’t used to people not caring about streams or views,” she told me. “Good art is not born out of fear.” Straus, whose elfin face is framed by a piecey shag, with arched pink lips, a delicate nose, and hazel eyes underscored by creases that make her look a little strung out, was setting up for her semi-regular queer costume party, BAZONGAS, at a warehouse in East Williamsburg. The theme was “Slut Funeral”—a celebration of her new album’s lead single, “RIP KP,” and her own symbolic rebirth—and a handful of employees from Partisan were moving a two-hundred-pound steel casket to the lip of a stage, which had been decorated with more than forty fake candles. Helping with the manual labor in a ribbed white tank top, shredded jeans, and Timberland work boots, she joked to me that she had no security concerns about throwing a party open to the public: “What are these, like, weird, funny lesbians going to do to me?” Her anxieties about the exposure had more to do with her own behavior. “I had decided in my head that I wanted to be of the people, and around people, and available to people, so what if I fucked up?” she told me. “What if I have too many drinks, or get embarrassed or defensive?” Straus modulates between a kind of studied languor and a firebrand’s stridency. “They’ve tried to media-train me at least eighteen times,” she said, within minutes of our first meeting. She repeatedly glanced at her publicity team as we spoke, even when they were out of earshot. The meta-acknowledgment of her ungovernability can seem strategic—as if it might make a journalist, or a collaborator, put less stock in her brash pronouncements. Chris Robbins and Brontë Jane, the married founders of section1, first met Straus over Zoom. It was Valentine’s Day, and Straus introduced herself to her prospective bosses by describing the lingerie her girlfriend had brought over. Robbins recalls thinking, “Only one of you exists in the world.” Straus was mouthy, sharp, and knowledgeable, recalling the punky theatrics of Courtney Love and Gwen Stefani, but the pair were most compelled by the paradox of a certain calculated authenticity—she wielded vulgarity with the choreographed poise of a clown. “It’s this idea of Mikaela as a total fucking rock star, but in the most self-aware, almost self-parodying way,” Jane explained. Straus’s approach to her new album reminded Jane of one of her favorite films, Ingmar Bergman’s “Persona,” in which a young nurse struggles to distinguish herself from her patient. The whole conceit of “King Princess” is arranged around a fun-house effect—seeing iterations of yourself that aren’t exactly you but which you nonetheless identify with. Straus took inspiration from the Surrealist French artist Claude Cahun (also androgynous and pseudonymous), whose uncanny self-portraits troubled the possibility of documenting a “real” self. “I still don’t know if I’m supposed to call her King Princess or Mikaela,” Hugh Jackman told me. He acted opposite Straus in the forthcoming film “Song Sung Blue”—her feature début—and, in April, invited her to join him onstage at his Radio City residency. They duetted Sonny & Cher’s “I Got You Babe,” and he recalled being taken by the immediacy of her performance. “She had rehearsed with the orchestra, but I felt like she was discovering the song for the first time as she sang it. That kind of confidence can’t be taught.” When Straus was a teen-ager, musician friends would designate certain sessions in the studio with her as “king princess days,” summoning a punk-diva spirit to the console: Mick Jagger in a bustier. (“I’m literally fifty-fifty,” Straus told me, of her gender. “There’s a huge disconnect between my body and my soul. I think that disconnect is powerful if it’s harnessed, but sometimes you wake up and you’re, like, ‘If I put clothes on this carcass, I’m going to kill myself.’ ”) Her relationship to womanhood, which has been fraught and erratic since a tomboyish childhood on the baseball team, relies on notions of drag and extravagance; if the standard is a caricature, she can’t fail in its execution. For her birthday, in December, she threw a Harry Potter-themed BAZONGAS and dressed in full prosthetics as a busty, camel-toed Voldemort. But the primary reason for dividing her identity is psychological. “It’s like E.M.D.R.,” she explained, referencing a form of therapy in which a patient alternates between positive and negative memories. “The whole thing is to create a safe place in your mind you can go to when things get overwhelming. King Princess is that for me.” Mikaela Mullaney Straus was born to Oliver Straus, a recording engineer, and Agnes Mullaney, who worked in fashion; they would separate by the time she turned three. The young Mikaela, responding to the fights whirling around her, began to lash out in turn. She also channelled her emotions into art. When she was six, her mother picked her up from a babysitter who informed her that Mikaela had written a song on GarageBand called “It’s O.K. to Be Wrong.” “Before I used music to impress anyone, I used music to cope with my very big feelings,” she told me. “I needed an outlet.” Mission Sound, an esteemed Brooklyn recording studio founded by Straus’s father, began in the cellar of the Williamsburg house where she grew up. At first, it was difficult to coax clients across the river—Oliver has described the neighborhood in the early nineties as “Siberia to Manhattan musicians.” Soon, though, he amassed an impressive portfolio of local artists, which now includes such hitmakers as Jack Antonoff, the National, and Shawn Mendes. After buying the two-story fixer-upper for seventy-five thousand dollars, Oliver invested in a Neve 8026 console that had been used by the likes of the Who and the Kinks. To accommodate the upgraded gear, he expanded his business into an old factory, where he still runs it, half a mile away. When Oliver and Agnes separated, she kept the house, and he moved into a small room next to the new studio. He installed a kitchenette and, in order to share custody of his daughter, built her a loft bed over his floor mattress. From the time that she could walk, Mikaela would sneak across the hall to play with whatever she could—microphones, guitars, keyboards, faders, all manner of expensive equipment that she regarded, to her father’s moderate distress, as toys. Musicians and audio engineers came and went, and Mikaela would sit on the couch behind them, imitating their riffs and vocal exercises. Sometimes a patron, taken by her precocity, would give her a lesson. She can play almost anything. (“I’m sort of a Swiss Army knife, except no woodwinds,” she told me.) When she was five, she finally earned her father’s praise by composing her first song, a clever jingle about her dog Jackie, and he recorded it on the Neve. But after he started a new family with a second wife, their relationship frayed. By the time she finished middle school, she’d taught herself to use the audio software Ableton Live so she could make music without him. “I think people think my dad was the type of person who could call up the head of a label and be, like, ‘My daughter!’ ” she told me. Instead, the chief privilege of her father’s profession was proximity. Through the studio, she’d met a songwriter who’d introduced her to a manager who’d introduced her to a producer, Mike Malchicoff, who helped her record “1950.” “If I was shit, nothing would’ve happened,” she said. (The bravado she traffics in can feel defensive, but not baseless.) Meanwhile, her mother’s house offered its own revolving door of mentors. Agnes, who has been sober for thirty-nine years, was a twelve-step sponsor, and the home was always bustling with guests from the program. Growing up, Straus said, “I was obsessed with very flawed people. You have to look at somebody’s character and be, like, ‘This is a good person, even though there’s fucked-up shit here.’ ” Agnes, aware that addiction ran in the family—she had met Oliver when both were in recovery—was terrified that similar dangers might befall her daughter. “For all the incredible patience she had with her sponsees, I got none of that,” Mikaela recalled. “But it was out of fear. And she was right.” In high school, she was disorganized and distracted. She attended Avenues, a private school in Manhattan, on financial aid and an arts merit scholarship. She smoked cigarettes in the bathroom, cheated on assignments, and rushed home to practice piano. That she was gay and believed she would one day be famous made her a tough hang for most. (“I don’t think I’m really that likable,” she once said, offhand.) But her difficulties in her weakest courses forced her to hone a different asset. She knew she needed to do something to distract her peers and instructors from a paucity of right answers—so she learned to make them laugh. Across thirteen slinky, dancey, scuzzy tracks, “Girl Violence” chronicles the frivolous, sexy havoc Straus has seen women wreak on one another’s lives. Almost all the associated visuals and concepts were her ideas. The cover art, an out-of-focus closeup of Straus’s face, pays homage to Blur’s self-titled album. The music video for “RIP KP” finds Straus, after a car wreck, in gay Hell: a place where strippers in leopard print strain Martinis through their toes and the bathroom attendant accepts tips below the skirt, placing them in the open maw of a muppet merkin. The record, which was completed late last year, got its start in the winter of 2022, after her sophomore venture, “Hold On Baby,” saw critical acclaim but only modest commercial returns. She had been working on a collection of new songs, including “Cry Cry Cry,” a bratty diss track with an infectious bridge. The label wasn’t sold. Straus was increasingly miserable in Los Angeles, navigating the breakdown of a four-year relationship and struggling to curtail her substance use. On a visit to New York, she met with two very different Brooklyn producers: Jacob Portrait, a warm but aloof multi-instrumentalist from the psych-rock band Unknown Mortal Orchestra, and Joe Pincus, an affable software geek who had programmed beats for Doechii and SZA. (“I think if you look at the three of us on paper, you’d be, like, how the fuck would this ever work?” Pincus said.) That summer, she left her label, her lease, and her relationship. It was time to go home. She returned to her mother’s house (and, as she made a point of mentioning when we met, now sleeps in the bed where she was conceived). In September of 2023, she booked a month at her dad’s studio with Portrait and Pincus. Oliver would make them dinner and pop his head in excitedly if he heard Mikaela shredding a guitar solo, but he mostly left them alone. “Having another cook in the kitchen, especially her dad, was not something Mikaela was interested in,” Portrait said. “He’s been in this business a long time. They both have really big opinions.” Eventually, Straus showed her father the finished record. He said that it sounded like Mission Sound. “That’s the highest compliment coming from him—that it sounds like his room,” she told me. Some of the new album is about her ex, including the swaggery, synth-heavy lament “Alone Again.” On the outro, Straus sings, “I got bigger dreams than being your baby / Honestly, I’m so relieved it’s over.” But “Girl Violence” is not a straightforward breakup album. Instead, it uses her heartbreak as a metaphor for other kinds of fissures and reinventions. On “Origin Story,” a hip-hop-percussive hero’s journey, she sings, I’ve had to face fire, fight fearand spend a lot of time in the mirrorI’m cool, I’m weirderYeah, I’m hot, I’m deeperI’m starting to feel myself again Until now, Straus’s work has flipped between styles like a jukebox. Unlike many popular artists, she was never classically trained or in any other bands, nor was she plucked from obscurity to perform assembly-line creations. More than anything, thanks to her childhood at Mission Sound, she was a mockingbird. Her discography feels like the output of, appropriately, a Zelig, rather than the committed expressions of a singular mind. Across two full-length albums, one EP, and a handful of singles, Straus has offered variations of R. & B., grunge, disco, electro-clash, funk, alternative, and soul. She has collaborated with Fiona Apple and the late Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, performed onstage with Julian Casablancas and Florence Welch, and covered Neil Young, Cyndi Lauper, Hole, Soundgarden, and the Velvet Underground (twice). She was raised on Led Zeppelin, Prince, David Bowie, and Jack White; she worships the Beatles’ live sessions. Identifying the latent similarities among her influences and doing away with anything ornamental or aspirational, “Girl Violence” finds its footing in late-nineties electronic rock. (“I feel like my live show has always been a rock show, even when I’m playing pop music,” she said. “Which is just to say that genre is meaningless.”) It’s her happiest album, sonically and lyrically, with only one ballad: the closer, “Serena,” which is a lullaby to a friend. “Cry Cry Cry,” released last month as the second single, is the standout. Its opening line—“Well, fuck me, I thought we were friends”—recalls the whiny yowls of Blink-182’s Mark Hoppus. It also highlights the greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts effect of the producing trio’s differences: Pincus, who has been nominated for a Grammy, brought his pop expertise, shoring up the twinkly harmonies and tight ’NSync drums, while Portrait drew on his background in the D.I.Y. scene, complimenting Straus’s pastiche bravura with a rough-edged Wheatus sleaze. Pincus’s textures are contemporary, but the references and use of real instruments by the other two make the finished product feel timeless. Straus, Pincus, and Portrait engineered “Girl Violence” themselves, forgoing the type of celebrity mixers she’d hired in the past. This time, wanting to figure out what “King Princess” actually sounded like, Straus went her own way. On a punishingly hot Wednesday night in June, Straus hosted a surprise preview show for “Girl Violence” at Market Hotel, an intimate, grimy standing-room venue that rattles when the subway passes. Save for the première of “RIP KP” on “Colbert” the night prior, it was her first time performing before an audience in years, and she was nervous, hiding out beforehand in the green room with her girlfriend. She would play the album all the way through with a mostly new band, in addition to her longtime drummer, Antoine Fadavi, and her bassist, Logan McQuade, who’d been beside her at the first-ever King Princess show, a Halloween party in 2017. (She was Ripley from “Alien”; he was a vague approximation of Jack Black in “School of Rock.”) “I can’t imagine being on stage without him,” she confessed, in a rare fit of sincerity. Straus shook off her dread as security guards escorted her through the crowd, teen-age girls squealing and clawing at her as she passed. “I missed you, New York,” she yelled under a rosy spotlight, wearing another skintight white tank top, this one bearing the name of her record across the chest. Hundreds of fans roared back. A louche, old-school performer, she channels Robert Plant and Iggy Pop, and elicits similar erotic zeal from her audience. As she sang, even with a guitar strapped to her shoulder, she ran her fingers up and down the mike stand, along her bare stomach, and through her curls, dripping with sweat. The new record is full of horny couplets, which she discharged without flinching. When she paused to slug a cherry-red cocktail, a fan screamed, “I love you!” The gig, which had sold out in nine minutes, was all-ages. Hours before showtime, dozens of young people, mostly queer women, had begun lining the noisy Bushwick block outside. Two sixteen-year-olds in baby-doll dresses and smears of thick eyeliner had come up from Long Island. “It’s hard to find people like this where I’m from,” one of them told me shyly. Nearby, a woman in her mid-fifties, who had taken the train in from Philadelphia for the set, waited for her wife to bring back drinks from the bar. She emphasized how much it meant to her to be in a majority-gay space. She’d grown up in the Pennsylvania suburbs and had come out, catastrophically, at thirteen; this year alone, more than a dozen anti-L.G.B.T.Q. bills have been proposed in her state. What she loved most about Straus, she said, was that “she’s unapologetically queer.” Toward the end of the set, Straus introduced a bluesy rendition of “1950” by entreating the crowd to sing along. “If you think about it, this is really where the girl violence started,” she said, taking a seat at the piano. “Crying over some pussy, as it goes.” Straus appreciates the environment at her shows, where, she told me later, “I’ve seen people get fingered, but I’ve never seen a fight.” She was sitting in the greenroom, curled up on a mottled brown-leather couch. “Sometimes,” she said, resting her head on her knees, “you’ll finish your set and a kid will come up to you and be, like, ‘I got kicked out of my house. I have forty dollars, and I bought this ticket.’ It really fucking changes things when you hear that.” She seemed offended when I asked if it ever felt like too much to bear. “I think part of the job of an artist is to be a listener. It’s not just about talking and playing and performing. It doesn’t take anything away from me—it gives me a reason to do this other than myself.” A week after Market Hotel, Straus was ready to let me see her home. “I need to smoke a blunt,” she said, leading me through a manicured courtyard with patio furniture and hydrangeas, where she sometimes inflates a kiddie pool for her dog, Raz, a six-year-old border-collie mutt who met us at the door. (The previous owners had named her after her affinity for raspberry White Claw.) Straus knelt down and let Raz kiss her face. “I’ve had her since she was five months old,” Straus told me, massaging the floppy ears with her thumbs. She led me upstairs so she could change into a pair of athletic shorts. I asked if the room had been her parents’. “Just my mom,” she said quickly. Behind her, the bed was neatly made, and an A.C. unit ruffled the leaves of a plant that hung off her armoire. When Straus got into U.S.C., her mother relocated with her third husband to Hawaii, where she keeps horses. Straus moved into her dorm room with the help of her manager rather than a parent. “She comes to New York a lot, and we talk on the phone every day,” Straus said. “But it is far. She missed the last show, which I know was hard for her.” On her upper arm is a tattoo of a bridle bit under the word “MOM.” Afterward, Straus rolled her contraband at the kitchen island and lit up, offering me a hit. (I politely declined.) On the walls hung White Stripes, T. Rex, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs posters. In her living room, PlayStation controllers, bundles of sage, a medieval sword, and packs of Zyn were shelved together under a glass coffee table. A nine-foot-tall stand of books—among them, the collected poems of Emily Dickinson, a Lou Reed biography, and “Gimpel the Fool,” by Isaac Bashevis Singer—was topped with a stack of wigs. “There are wigs everywhere, if you want to wear one,” she said, following my gaze. Would it make her more comfortable if I made a fool of myself? She told me that it would. Scattered among novelty objects, including a wax candle of a woman’s crotch and a signed portrait of RuPaul, were accolades from her career: late-night-show call sheets, an “S.N.L.” plaque, and the framed platinum vinyl for “1950.” For every measure of her efforts, there has to be a punch line to undercut it, or perhaps to make it seem all the more impressive. She kicked back on a sectional, letting Raz splay across her lap, and I asked what she hoped people might take away from “Girl Violence.” She hit the blunt contemplatively, and then answered. “I hope that it just feels like I’m having fun.” ♦

Title: The fall of Elon Musk down Fortune’s 100 Most Powerful People in Business list shows how power is impermanent

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Fortune’s 2025 ranking of the world’s 100 most powerful people in business came out this morning. Unlike revenue or market cap, power is a more complex concept. We calculate not just the size of the person’s businesses, but also the health of their companies, as well as their innovation, influence, impact and where they are in the arc of their career. By those measures, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came in No. 1 on this year’s list. In addition to creating specialized computer chips that are coveted by companies developing artificial intelligence, he is on the front lines of a technology that is changing the global business landscape itself. Power is not permanent. Elon Musk topped last year’s list not only because of his roles at Tesla, SpaceX, xAI and X, but also because of his work in the Trump Administration. That changed. This year, Musk is No. 4 on the list. Power is also relative. Companies and leaders grow strong when they have a worthy rival to measure themselves against. Thus Jensen Huang has AMD CEO Lisa Su, his first cousin once removed, on his heels as a powerful chipmaker. As part of this year’s package, we look at how rivalries in key industries are playing out. You can check out the full list here. Federal grand jury will probe Trump’s “Russia hoax” allegations Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed a U.S. attorney to empanel a grand jury to investigate the intelligence community’s handling of allegations that Moscow had influence over President Trump’s 2016 election campaign. No targets were named, but the investigation will likely look at Obama-era cabinet members such as former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey. Trump threatens yet more tariffs on India over Russian oil purchases India got a 25% tariff rate in the last round, but the president is angry that India continues to buy Russian oil. “India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits. They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine,” he said on Trump Social. India said this was hypocrisy because the EU continues to trade with Russia and faces no similar sanctions. Palantir delivers blowout quarter Sales were up almost 50% to nearly $1 billion, beating expectations. Net income was $327 million, up 144%. CEO Alex Karp lifted guidance for Q3. The stock closed up 4% yesterday and rose another 5% in overnight trading. “We’re planning to grow our revenue … while decreasing our number of people,” CEO Alex Karp told CNBC. “This is a crazy, efficient revolution. The goal is to get 10x revenue and have 3,600 people. We have now 4,100.” Deutsche Bank CEO approved trades that were later investigated Christian Sewing approved a €1.5 billion deal that was later investigated by Italian authorities, resulting in six of his former colleagues being sentenced to prison on false accounting charges. The convictions were later overturned on appeal. Deutsche Bank denied there was any wrongdoing on Sewing’s part: “Any allegation of a conflict of interest involving Christian Sewing is completely unfounded,” it told the FT. Trump wants to ban “debanking” The president is planning to issue an executive order directing bank regulators to investigate whether banks deny accounts to people with right-wing opinions or those involved in crypto, to see whether such bans might violate credit, consumer, or antitrust laws. JPMorgan strategist sounds alarm on labor demographic issues David Kelly, JPMorgan Asset Management’s Chief Global Strategist, warned on Monday that immigration restrictions and a growing elderly population could mean “no growth in workers at all” in the next 5 years. Kelly warned that cutting rates could lead to wage and price inflation instead of propelling economic growth. Anthropic CEO on Meta’s poaching Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei says the company’s employees have been less eager to accept poaching offers from Meta and the company won’t make competing offers because that would jeopardize company culture. “We are not willing to compromise our compensation principles, our principles of fairness, to respond individually to these offers,” Amodei recently said on the Big Technology Podcast. S&P 500 futures were up 0.13% this morning, premarket, after the index closed up 1.47% yesterday. STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.3% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was up 0.35% in early trading. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.65%. China’s CSI 300 was up 0.8%. The South Korea KOSPI was up 1.6%. India’s Nifty 50 was down 0.46%. Bitcoin remains above $114K. Elon Musk retains title as the highest-paid CEO in history with $26 billion pay package—and the only thing he has to do is show up for two years by Amanda Gerut Here’s what the doomsayers are getting wrong about the job market, according to a Wall Street veteran by Jason Ma China’s fertility crisis is so dire, rates are falling below ‘replacement levels’ and GDP could slow by more than half in the next 30 years, study says by Eleanor Pringle Dan Morehead assembled his Princeton mafia to pile into Bitcoin at $65 in 2013, leaving his Wall Street career behind to build a $5 billion crypto fund by Leo Schwartz Michael Saylor’s Strategy makes its third-largest Bitcoin purchase ever by Kirk Ogunrinde of Bloomberg CEO Daily is compiled and edited by Joey Abrams and Jim Edwards. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Rare is getting a limited edition 8BitDo controller for its 40th anniversary, and I can't help but feel bittersweet about it

A pyrrhic victory When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It's definitely been a trying year for Rare, but there is at least something to shout about for fans of the legendary Twycross-based developer in the form of a limited edition 8BitDo controller. This 8BitDo Ultimate controller for Xbox consoles and PC has been spotted over at Amazon (via Eurogamer), and is intended to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary. No release date has been revealed yet, and it seems like it'll only be available to US audiences at present. It's definitely one of the nicest limited edition 8BitDo controllers to date, featuring a blue and yellow color scheme reminiscent of the developer's logo. It's also emblazoned with iconography from some of its most renowned titles, including Sea of Thieves and Banjo-Kazooie. There's even a banana there as a cheeky nod to the Donkey Kong Country series as well as Donkey Kong 64. If you're unfamiliar with the 8BitDo controller, it's a bit of a revelation in the third-party gamepad space. It features Hall effect thumbsticks made to combat drift, two remappable buttons for secondary inputs, and a 2.4GHz dongle for wireless connectivity. The 8BitDo Ultimate also includes a charging dock in the box, for a clever and easy way to keep the pad topped up. I consider it to be one of the best Xbox controllers and best Nintendo Switch controllers on the market today. I can't help but feel bittersweet about the reveal of this controller, though. While Sea of Thieves is a tremendous game and continues to enjoy a dedicated player base, Rare's 40th year hasn't exactly been smooth-sailing. The developer's next game, Everwild, was recently canceled. This is in spite of comments from Xbox boss Phil Spencer back in February of this year, where he claimed the game's development was progressing. Rare also created the Perfect Dark series, an immersive sim-esque reboot of which was also shuttered along with its developer The Initiative amidst another round of Xbox Game Studios layoffs.

Title: Amazon restructures audio division with Wondery podcasts shift

Amazon made a big splash in the podcasting industry in early 2021 when it bought studio Wondery for a reported $300m. Four and a half years on, however, some changes are afoot. Bloomberg reported that Amazon is “breaking up” Wondery’s operations, splitting its shows and remaining team between the company’s Audible subsidiary and a new ‘creator services’ division. Remaining team? Yes, layoffs are part of this: around 110 people are losing their jobs according to the report, which painted the move as “an acknowledgement that Amazon’s big push into podcasts hasn’t worked out as planned”. This certainly isn’t Amazon giving up on podcasts, which are an increasingly-prominent part of its Amazon Music service, as well as featuring on Audible. The fact that Amazon Music, Audible and Twitch sit under the same umbrella within Amazon – overseen by VP of audio, Twitch and games Steve Boom – hints at potential to do more in the sweet spot between podcasting, video and influencers. That’s something Spotify and YouTube are also both leaning heavily into in 2025.

Saudi Arabian oil company Aramco reported a 22% drop in second-quarter profit today, mainly on lower revenue, while it racked up more debt. The world's top oil exporter reported a net profit of $22.7 billion in the three months ended June 30, missing a company-provided median estimate from 17 analysts of $23.7 billion. Aramco's average realised crude oil price was $66.7 a barrel in the quarter, down from $85.7 in the second quarter of 2024 and $76.3 in the first quarter of this year. Total borrowing rose to $92.9 billion at June 30 from $74.4 a year prior. Gearing, a measure of indebtedness, rose to 6.5% from minus 0.3% a year earlier and 5.3% the previous quarter. The company, long a cash cow for the Saudi state, confirmed a previously outlined $21.3 billion in total dividends for the second quarter, roughly $200 million of which is performance-linked dividends, a mechanism introduced after a windfall from oil prices in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Aramco in March outlined total dividends of $85.4 billion for 2025 - a 37% drop from its payout of over $124 billion the previous year. The performance-linked component is set to plunge 98% to $900 million as the company's free cash flow dwindles. Free cash flow dropped nearly a fifth year-on-year in the second quarter to $15.2 billion. Reuters reported last month that Aramco is close to a deal to raise around $10 billion in investment from a group led by BlackRock and is considering selling up to five of its gas-powered power plants to raise up to $4 billion, as Riyadh presses the company to increase profit and payout. For the Saudi government, which owns 81.5% of Aramco shares directly and another 16% through its sovereign wealth fund PIF, dividends are a critical source of income, particularly as it spends on efforts to diversify the economy away from oil. Oil generated 62% of the government's revenue last year. The International Monetary fund estimates the kingdom needs oil at more than $90 a barrel to balance its 2025 budget. Global crude benchmark Brent was trading at $68.83 at 0625 GMT. © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard confirms Operation Mockingbirdâs ongoing influence, linking it to CIA tactics weaponizing media and intelligence to undermine President Trump. $900M Biden Propaganda Campaign fueled distrust in the CDC through misleading data on masks, vaccines and child health. Scientists admit psychological tactics â including fear-based manipulation â were employed during the pandemic. Modern Mockingbird Tools include algorithmic censorship, social media surveillance and Big Tech partnerships. Trumpâs Agenda aims to dismantle âDeep Stateâ media propaganda apparatuses, per Gabbard. $900M Biden Propaganda Campaign fueled distrust in the CDC through misleading data on masks, vaccines and child health.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard dropped a literary-sized bombshell on American democracy this week, confirming Cold War-era intelligence tactics are now targeting U.S. citizens. The CIAâs infamous Operation Mockingbird â once a tool for influencing foreign and domestic media â is, she says, alive and weaponized to undercut the Trump administration and distort public opinion. In a July 31 interview with conservative host Benny Johnson, Gabbard described intelligence insiders leaking secrets exclusively to âfriendsâ in corporate media, including Fox News and CNN, though their parent companies are owned by globalist-aligned firms like BlackRock (a World Economic Forum partner). âThey believe their will is more important than yours,â Gabbard warned. âWeaponizing public records to sabotage elected leadership is an attack on constitutional order and the American people.â This isnât fringe conspiracyÂ â Gabbard, a former U.S. Congressmember, has official authority to corroborate it.Â Nor is it limited to leaks: Todayâs âMockingbird 2.0â uses artificial intelligence, corporate surveillance and $900 million in federal propaganda funneled into media narratives during Bidenâs pandemic response. "The CDC was a propaganda machine": The $900M truth Gabbardâs warnings align with a 2024 House report that found Bidenâs CDC spent taxpayer money to spread âerroneousâ data during the pandemic. According to the Energy and Commerce Committee, ads exaggerated vaccine efficacy, underplayed childrenâs risks and partnered with Big Tech to monitor Americans. Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said the campaign eroded trust in public health entirely: âThey weaponized fear. Millions believed threats that either lacked evidence or were exaggerated.â Perhaps most alarming: House investigators revealed the CDC distributed messaging that conflicted with FDA authorization â flagrantly violating its role as a regulatory body. Whistleblowers expose fear as a weapon Gabbardâs claims gained credibility when former UK pandemic advisors admitted to exploiting psychological tactics from 2020â2022. A Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group (SPI-B) member told JonFleetwood.com: âFear smacked of totalitarianism.â The groupâs psychologists inflated risks to justify lockdowns, even while knowing public resistance could weaken compliance. One member now calls the program âdystopian,â admitting, âWe handed dictators a playbook.â Modern Mockingbird tools While the original Mockingbird relied on clandestine journalist recruitment, todayâs iteration is digital, mass-scale and taxpayer-funded. Gabbardâs team identified five key mechanisms: Leaked intel narratives: Directed to âloyalâ media for manipulated headlines. AI censorship: Social platforms suppress dissent through algorithmic bias. CDC youth influencers: Funded accounts âtesting the waterâ on experimental drugs. Surveillance partnerships: Tech giants hand over private data under âpublic healthâ mandates. Fear psychology: Campaigns weaponized child vaccination mandates to gin public outrage. The end of the domino theory? Or just the beginning? Operation Mockingbirdâs resurrection serves as a eulogy for the American pressâs perceived independence. The Church Committeeâs 1975 findings âÂ exposing CIA ties with the New York Times, TimeÂ and CBSÂ â were labeled âconspiracy theories.â Now, Gabbard validates its continuation in digital warfare. President Trump tapped Gabbard to dismantle this apparatus, and she insists his election victory was no accident. âThe public sees it,â Gabbard says, âand thatâs why this fight is personal.â The Mockingbird sings for democracy Gabbardâs revelation forces a reckoning: When government agencies use media as propaganda arsenals, democracy dies in darkness. Whether Mockingbirdâs revival is a âcovert programâ or institutionalized overreach, its effects are clear â erosion of trust, facilitated censorship and a public increasingly weaponized against itself. As Harper Leeâs Atticus Finch said, killing innocence mocks the very society that commits it. Tulsi Gabbardâs fight isnât just about accountability. Itâs about preserving journalismâs soul â and democracyâs future.

Title: Energy transition: Waratah Super battery, Australia’s biggest, turns on at Munmorah Power Station site for BlackRock’s Akaysha Energy

One of the most powerful batteries built anywhere in the world has started operating at the site of an old coal-fired power station in New South Wales, delivering a critical boost to the eastern seaboard’s electricity grid as it transitions to cleaner energy sources. United States-based asset giant BlackRock’s Akaysha Energy said on Tuesday it had activated the first batch of capacity from its $1 billion Waratah Super Battery, a project spanning the size of eight Australian rules football fields at the shuttered Munmorah Power Station site on the NSW Central Coast. BlackRock is involved with the Waratah Super Battery in NSW, which will rank among the biggest grid-scale batteries anywhere in the world. The huge storage system would initially work like a “shock absorber” to buffer the network from disruptions caused by events such as lightning strikes or bushfires, the company said. Grid-scale batteries, with response times measured in split seconds, are seen as essential to Australia’s green energy shift because of their ability to soak up surplus renewable output in daylight hours and use it to plug gaps in supply and stabilise the system at times of low wind and sunlight, or during unexpected outages. While the Waratah Super Battery would initially be limited to 350 megawatts, it would reach 850 megawatts with 1680 megawatt hours of storage once it ramped to full capacity, which may be as early as the end of the year, Akaysha said on Tuesday. This would make it the most powerful utility-scale battery in the world, although other larger projects are under construction elsewhere in Australia and globally. Australia is experiencing one of the world’s fastest energy transitions as polluting coal-fired generators, which still supply most of the grid’s electricity, reach the end of their lives, while wind and solar farms are expanding their role in the grid every year. Australians are also world leaders in per-person solar uptake, with more than 4 million homes – or one in three – now fitted with rooftop solar panels. However, all those solar panels are making far too much electricity in the middle of the day when the sun is brightest, and hardly any when the grid needs it most – in the evenings when the sun sets and demand spikes as people arrive home and turn on lights and appliances. To help balance wild swings in supply and demand before the next wave of coal plant closures, Australian governments, utilities and investors are pouring billions of dollars into developing large, flexible battery storage systems across the grid. The Australian Energy Market Operator has been calling for greater investment in “firming” assets, including batteries and hydroelectric dams, alongside a new fleet of fast-ramping, gas-fired power stations to prepare the grid for a rapidly approaching future without coal. Switching on the Waratah Super Battery was a “win for our grid, and a win for households and businesses”, said Hannah McCaughey, chief executive of NSW government-owned EnergyCo, which is overseeing the project’s delivery. “It will help provide clean, reliable and affordable energy to the people of our state and the national electricity market,” she said. Akaysha Energy chief executive Nick Carter described the start-up of the first 350 megawatts of the Waratah Super Battery as a “major milestone, and a moment of real pride” for the Melbourne-based company, which was bought by BlackRock in 2023. Transgrid, which owns and operates the high-voltage transmission network in NSW, said the Waratah Super Battery had been contracted to provide automated real-time system monitoring services for 36 transmission lines to detect overloading and respond within seconds. “In network contingency events such as lightning strikes, the System Integrity Protection Scheme acts as a shock absorber to return the network to a stable condition and maintain continuity of supply for consumers,” Transgrid general manager Jennifer Hughes said. “It’s like an insurance policy for NSW, and the whole system is triggered automatically, making it fast and reliable in responding to a system event or fault.” The Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day’s trading.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Lines are being drawn in Amazon and Google’s evolving rivalry

Hear from execs at The New York Times, Thomson Reuters, Trusted Media Brands and many others This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → Uncertainties over the impact of U.S. import tariffs, as well as the disruption of AI, are upending the global economic order. It might seem intuitive that Big Tech (as a collective) will be the big beneficiaries of such trends, but as the recent raft of quarterly earnings releases demonstrates, such players are repositioning, and the impact on Madison Avenue could potentially be seismic. Google-owner Alphabet was the first across the line, and in last week’s analysis, Digiday noted how ad tech is a declining priority for the Big Tech giant of Madison Avenue, with AI dominating Wall Street analysts’ questions (see right). As the remainder of ‘GAFAM’ – that’s Apple, Facebook (or Meta), Amazon, and Microsoft – followed suit with their results for the period, the AI-intrigue continued. However, for those paying close attention to how their priorities will impact the marketing and advertising market, there were some breadcrumbs pointing toward potential political ruptures, given how such players account for almost two-thirds of U.S. ad spend. Firstly, it’s worth clarifying how Google is far from a shrinking willow in the advertising market, given its $96.4 billion Q2 revenue haul – it’s still the clear pace-setter on Madison Avenue. And while its Google Network business, a.k.a. what was DoubleClick, is in continued decline, core platforms like Search and YouTube grew 12 percent and 13 percent, respectively, with analysts noting how it has shifted from an enabler of the ecosystem to a premium media owner, with its AI overviews also setting a new paradigm. Meanwhile, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg used this juncture to launch his “Personal Superintelligence” manifesto – for shareholders’ sake, let’s hope this one receives a warmer welcome than his metaverse prophecy. However, glib observations aside, Meta’s 3.4 billion-strong audience helped generate $47.5 billion during the same reporting period, up 22 percent year over year — a strong performance, indeed — with the Facebook and Instagram owner also underscoring its AI efforts. Ahead of any further analysis, it is worth reminding ourselves that Alphabet’s latest earnings suggest a strategic shift away from third-party ad tech dominance toward owned-and-operated platforms (not to mention AI), and it’s this shift in priorities that may focus Amazon Advertising’s energies in the near-to-mid-term. In its Q2 earnings update, Amazon reported $167.7 billion in revenue, a 12 percent increase from the year-ago period, according to the company’s latest earnings disclosure. According to the company’s executives, advertising played a key role in driving growth, a contrast to what several analysts deemed a worrying outlook for its AI investments. Understandably, Wall Street queries focused on hot-button issues, such as whether tariffs will impact Amazon’s core e-commerce business and its prospects in the ongoing AI land grab, with such developments casting an interesting light on its growing ads business. On the company’s subsequent earnings call, which took place ahead of the crunch tariff deadline from the U.S. administration, Amazon’s executives emphasized the unpredictability of the situation, with CEO Andy Jassy observing, “In the first half, we just haven’t seen diminished demand.” Given the broader AI narrative, many analysts’ questions centered on its AWS vertical, which generated $30.9 billion in revenue, a 17.5 percent year-over-year increase. Notably, Morgan Stanley’s Brian Novak bluntly articulated the perception that “AWS is falling behind with Gen AI.” Evidently, Jassy’s response did little to reverse such notions, with Amazon’s stock price dropping by 7 percent in the hours after the call. Meanwhile, the online giant’s advertising business had a significant impact on its bottom line, contributing $15.7 billion, a 22 percent year-over-year increase, or (more pertinently to the matter at hand) accounting for 9.4 percent of Amazon’s total revenue for the period. As Amazon CFO, Brian Lioswski, noted, “Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North American [and] international segments.” Note how this contrasts with the way AWS margins “saw headwinds” during the reporting period, and as Lioswski also noted, “We expect AWS margins to fluctuate over time.” Amazon executives also highlighted some of its tentpole Cannes Lions announcements, such as its integration with Roku. All of this is understandable, particularly as analysts take an increasingly austere view of AWS’ outlook; after all, the high margins of digital advertising have created some of the biggest Big Tech behemoths. And that’s why the recent emergence that Amazon has abruptly cut its Google Shopping ad spending is causing speculation: could this be the start of a tit-for-tat trade war (of sorts) between a Big tech pairing who also happen to be two of Madison Avenue’s biggest spenders? One of the biggest stories on Madison Avenue over the past 12 months has been Amazon, specifically as an advertiser, awarding separate parts of its media account to different holding companies worldwide. It’s well understood that the unspoken horse-trading of winning such large accounts – separate estimates put Big Tech’s marketing spend in the range of $20 billion or more per year – involves a degree of deal-making. In the case of Amazon, several Digiday sources have speculated that awarding such a lucrative account would have involved an implied, if not outright stated, expectation that a certain percentage of spend will be channeled in the direction of its accompanying media business. If this is the case, will Google look to retaliate? Furthermore, more puckish observers might note that Google’s account review, which took place in 2021, saw it consolidate its media business within WPP’s Essence – the same business unit that won Amazon’s media business in Europe and APAC.Are these shifting tectonic plates signs of a brewing storm between the two that could have a scaled downstream impact? “Payor reliability is slipping — only 43 percent paid on time more often than not, with ‘always-on-time’ payors down to just 13 percent.” — OAREX evp Nick Carrabbia cites statistics from the company’s H1 2025 Payments Study. As YouTube Shorts reaches 200 billion views, advertisers increase their investment Brands now find Shorts a cost-effective way to reach audiences absent on TikTok and Instagram, with low CPMs around $5 — that’s half the cost of Meta Reels or TikTok, according to sources – proving a big draw. Enhanced monetization tools and creator incentives have also fueled growth, with advertisers accelerating their reallocation of budget to Shorts for more efficient reach and performance. Inside the search rumor swirling around Meta Amid a changing internet landscape, the old adage that “Google is for Search, Facebook is for Social…” is losing traction.

Title: Has The Crypto Market Bottomed? Analyst Says ‘This Is It’

Time Published: 2025-08-05T01:00:50Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Macro analyst Alex Krüger says the weekend’s sell-off has likely marked a tradable low for the crypto market, arguing that the move closely mirrors the 2024 “August crash” that bottomed on a Monday. “I see the current move as a smaller scale replay of last year’s August crash (which bottomed on Monday),” Krüger wrote on late-Friday in a post on X, adding that he would “be looking to add to longs on Monday, ideally before the US cash open,” if the overnight session remained panicky. He framed the decline as a classic shakeout rather than the start of a new downtrend. Krüger’s read hinges on macro first, crypto second. He notes that 2024’s August break came in a sequence—BoJ tightening, a hawkish FOMC, then weak payrolls—and he sees the present sequence as “similar.” There was no carry-trade impulse this time, he said, but markets digested a modestly hawkish Fed, mixed Big Tech earnings, a hotter-than-expected PCE inflation print, and finally a “horrid” US payrolls report—after which risk assets slid in tandem and crypto tracked equities lower. The latest PCE data, released July 31, showed headline inflation accelerating to 2.6% year over year and core PCE at 2.8%, a notch above forecasts—what Krüger summarized as “slightly hot.” Earnings tape-bombs reinforced the risk-off mood. Microsoft and Meta beat estimates and initially rallied, while Apple’s reception was cooler and Amazon’s results were “very poorly received,” with AMZN sliding about 7–8% as investors questioned AWS’s momentum. Coinbase’s report landed at the other extreme for crypto beta: revenue missed expectations and the stock fell, a backdrop Krüger called “dreadful” for sentiment. “Even though the aforementioned concerns emboldened bears, this week’s move has been mainly a macro story, given how crypto traded mostly in line with equity indices,” he wrote. He also flagged an unusual political and geopolitical coda to this weekend’s rout. After the weak jobs report—plus an unusually stark revision by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, May and June were revised down by a combined 258,000 jobs—markets lurched, and the White House’s subsequent decision to reposition two US nuclear submarines amid heated exchanges with Moscow added to stress, he said. Kremlin officials later tried to downplay escalation risk, calling the submarine moves “routine.” Krüger called the nuclear rhetoric and presidential barbs at the Fed “noise” for markets, but said the combination likely helped flush leveraged positions into the close. On crypto-specific drivers, Krüger listed a cluster of narratives that, in his view, amplified bearish conviction without changing the macro center of gravity: disappointing Coinbase results; debate around whether MicroStrategy could curtail its at-the-market equity issuance, limiting incremental BTC buys; questions about the sustainability of “DATs” (digital-asset treasury companies) tied to ETH; and, on the other side of the ledger, the SEC’s new “Project Crypto,” a policy push to modernize securities rules and move more market infrastructure on-chain—“an extremely bullish development that should drive inflows later in the year,” as he put it. The SEC’s chair outlined “American Leadership in the Digital Finance Revolution” last week, framing tokenization and on-chain market plumbing as a regulatory priority. Krüger’s base case is timing-driven: either crypto “bottomed after today’s close, given the sheer violence of that final dump, or will be bottoming together with equities on Monday.” In his plan, the trigger to add risk was early Monday—assuming the overnight remained disorderly—on the view that the analog to August 2024 would rhyme at the turn of the week. “A violent shakeout,” he wrote, not a regime change. He remains constructive into the fourth quarter, citing three pillars: a still-solid US economy, the start of Fed rate cuts, and a steadily improving regulatory climate that should broaden institutional and retail participation. Policy churn could amplify that path. Krüger pointed to Fed Governor Adriana Kugler’s resignation—effective this month—as a potentially market-relevant shift because it hands the White House an earlier-than-expected Board vacancy, and to former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh’s call for a new “Treasury–Fed accord” as a signpost for constraints on central-bank independence. On Monday he added, “This will prove to be very important later on,” citing Warsh’s argument about “limits on the Fed’s independence to help the govt with its finances.” Whether those institutional dynamics translate into earlier or deeper rate cuts remains open, but markets have already moved to price odds to 85% for a September cut following the payrolls miss. Krüger’s longer arc is unabashedly bullish but explicitly conditional on the macro. “I remain bullish on crypto into Q4,” he wrote, while warning that ETH-linked treasury plays could “lose momentum dramatically” later in the year if goods inflation re-accelerates as corporates pass tariffs through. He set a one-year Bitcoin target for mid-2026 at $200,000–$250,000—“extreme, but possible”—on the premise that a more dovish Fed in 2026 would coincide with ongoing adoption. For now, he is treating last week’s cascade as an echo of 2024’s Monday bottom.

Title: The Proof That Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner Hasn't Lost His Magic Touch

ByCaroline Reid ByCaroline Reid, Senior Contributor. Media companies don't come much more historic than Disney. The eponymous studio was founded by Walt Disney and his brother Roy 101 years ago and, to this day, only two other executives have been as synonymous with the company as they were. Disney's current chief executive Bob Iger will forever be associated with the Mouse thanks to his acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox. They turned Disney into a titan which consistently ranks as the highest-grossing studio in the movie industry. However, neither Iger nor even Walt himself laid the modern-day foundations that Disney is built on. Iger's predecessor Michael Eisner can take the credit for that and his track record at Disney really is the fairest of them all. Few executives have cast as powerful a spell on the entertainment industry as Eisner. When he became Disney's chief executive on September 22, 1984 its stock price was just $1.24 and the studio was in the doldrums. However, by the time he handed over the hot seat to Iger 21 years later, each share was worth $23.80 and Disney was the world's biggest media company. Impressive as this is, it isn't the clearest evidence that Eisner really does have a magic touch. The New York native joined Disney after an eight-year stint as chief executive of Paramount where he launched ground-breaking movies like Saturday Night Fever, Beverly Hills Cop and Raiders of the Lost Ark. At the time, Disney was a shadow of what it is today. Construction costs at Walt Disney World in Orlando had spiralled and attempts to make more modern movies had led to forgettable live-action films such as sci-fi flop The Black Hole and Condorman, starring Michael Crawford. Combined with a failure to focus on new animation, repeated re-releases of its back catalogue and declining quality standards at its theme parks, Disney was at risk. "They lost the company basically by overspending on Walt Disney World," explained Eisner in an interview with this author. "People don’t remember that but Walt, and particularly his brother, coming out of the Depression, were afraid of debt, so instead of using debt to build a pretty much over budget theme park in Florida, they used their equity. They sold. They lost control. They also way overspent and they didn’t have the attendance so between losing control, not having the attendance, not doing new animation, having very few live-action pictures, re-releasing the old library theatrically prior to home video, the company was at risk." He added that "it was being torn apart. It could have been over in six weeks. When we walked down Main Street the second day in Disneyland I realised what a valuable asset it was." Eisner knew what was needed. "[George] With a wave of his magic wand, Eisner brought Disney back to its roots of hand-drawn animation yielding beloved favourites like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. "We concentrated on reinvigorating animation, particularly musical animation," he explained. "We obviously made an early deal with Lucas for Star Tours and Raiders of the Lost Ark because we had no recent movies for which to put in the parks. We then had a lot of recent movies, whether it was the Roger Rabbits, or the Aladdins, or Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King or whatever." Eisner then commissioned rides based on them as well as merchandise to sell in the theme parks so the films acted as promotion for Disney’s resorts which in turn drove the sale of toys that would fuel kids’ interest in the movies. Eisner doubled down on this spellbinding cycle by building two new theme parks in Florida as well as others in California, Paris and Hong Kong. The 1990s were a golden era for the theme park industry and Disney was at the vanguard of it. So much so in fact that it was referred to as the Disney Decade. As Eisner explained, "we went to Europe. We went to Japan. We started negotiating in Hong Kong. We opened in Hong Kong. All that before I left." In turn, Hong Kong Disneyland paved the way for the opening of the Shanghai Disney Resort in 2016 which, until recently, was the studio's latest park. That only changed in May when it announced that one of its outposts is coming to Abu Dhabi's Yas Island after Iger signed a deal with Mohamed Al Zaabi, the trailblazing chief executive of Miral, the world's leading theme park operator outside Disney and Universal Studios. The impact of Eisner's expansion was magnified by his emphasis on quality and details. He describes his legacy as "the strategy of excellence. The strategy of whatever you do, do it really well." It is no exaggeration. When Disneyland Paris (Euro Disney as it was then known) was being developed, Eisner amassed a team of the world's best designers to make it the most immersive theme park ever built. They included Eddie Sotto, who meticulously created the park’s turn-of-the-century themed Main Street, and Tom Morris, the architect of its majestic castle. The clearest evidence they succeeded is the fact that the Disneyland Paris is still Europe’s most-visited theme park even though a new attraction hasn’t been built there for several decades. As this report revealed, launching Disneyland Paris may actually be the studio’s best-ever deal. Eisner’s effect didn’t just extend to expansion. "We improved the food at Walt Disney World which was terrible in 1984. We built 30,000 hotel rooms, high-quality hotels, which they didn’t have - they had two." He added that “we did that in architecture. We built 80 buildings around the world at Disney. They had never done this before at Disney, they had always done it internally. We went with the best architects around the world.” Eisner’s expansion helped Disney to become the world’s most-visited theme park operator with 142.1 million guests streaming through its turnstiles in 2023 according to the latest data from the Themed Entertainment Association. That's just the start. In order to ensure that the studio didn’t get left behind by the rise of computer-animated movies, Eisner signed a pioneering deal in 1991 to distribute Pixar’s modern-day fairytales. Its films like Finding Nemo and Toy Story grossed a total of $3.4 billion during Eisner’s tenure paving the way for Disney’s $7.4 billion acquisition of Pixar in 2006. Ten years after he took over the top job at Disney, Eisner created a new category of entertainment when he gave the green light to a Broadway show based on Beauty and the Beast. It opened at the Palace Theatre in New York in 1994 and was such a success that it set the stage for other shows based on The Lion King, Aladdin, and Frozen. Since then, Disney Theatrical Group’s 10 titles have been seen by around 230 million theatergoers in 38 countries with The Lion King alone becoming the most successful show in theatre history playing to more than 115 million people in 100 cities. Instead of resting on his laurels, Eisner pushed the boat out and in 1998 launched Disney Cruise Line which now generates more than $2 billion of annual revenue as I revealed in British newspaper City A.M. Eisner declines to comment on the future of Disney and possible successors for Iger who he is in very close and frequent contact with. However, Eisner is happy to look back and says that his turnaround of the company was driven by “new content, invigorated management, diverse management, which we didn't have when I got there, great assets that Walt created that you had to build upon. No one big thing to put the company at risk. Motion pictures that were less than the industry average. All of those things together were a result of what turned Disney around. Going to Broadway, which has been a giant success. And I think the businesses that we put together in those 21 years are still the businesses that Disney is [today].” As the chart below and data here shows, by the time that Eisner stepped down on September 30, 2005, Disney’s stock price was $23.80 which was a staggering 19.2 times higher than when he joined the company. It comfortably makes him the most successful boss in Disney's history as its stock price only rose 5.4 times during Iger's initial term which ran until February 25, 2020 when each share was worth $128.19. Former theme parks chief Bob Chapek took over the driving seat and although the stock price hit an all-time high of $201.91 under him, by the time he handed the reins back to Iger on November 20, 2022, it had slumped to just $97.58 which was lower than when he became Disney's boss. When Eisner stepped down he could have retired thanks to his sizeable pile of Disney stock which has soared even higher in value under Iger, closing at $119.35 today. Instead, he built up a boutique media company called Tornante after seeing signs showing the word on a cycling trip through Italy. Meaning 'hairpin turn’, the name was fitting as Tornante headed in a completely different direction to Disney by producing hit adult animation series on Netflix such as Bojack Horseman and Tuca and Bertie. Despite his close ties to streaming, Eisner is still a big believer in movie theaters as this reporter revealed in the Daily Mail in 2023. He has also recently written a book called Camp, about the lessons he learned at summer camp, and has diversified outside media. Tornante has made investments in prize-draw company Omaze and trading card business Topps, which was sold to Fanatics in 2022 for an estimated $500 million. However, they were just trailers for the main event. Soon after Eisner turned 75 in 2017 he took perhaps his biggest swing yet when he acquired British soccer club Portsmouth FC. The team was founded in 1898 and was experiencing one of the toughest times in its history. In 2012 the historic team had fallen two tiers below the top flight Premier League after collapsing into administration – the British equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy – for the second time in two years. Its plight was so serious that it had to be rescued by its fans before its real life prince charming came along. Eisner had some experience in sports as under his leadership Disney bought the Los Angeles Angels baseball team and founded the Anaheim Ducks NHL squad which went on to win the World Series and the Stanley Cup respectively. Accordingly, making a success of a soccer team may sound like a cinch, especially for someone who built up the world’s biggest media company. However, Eisner wasn't willing to buy his way to the top and burn up blockbuster losses. There is good reason for this. Eisner was one of the first of a string of American celebrities to invest in British soccer teams. He was followed by Ryan Reynolds, Michael B Jordan and Will Ferrell who invested in Wrexham FC, AFC Bournemouth and Leeds United respectively. Eisner wasn’t jumping on a bandwagon and instead bought Portmouth FC, or Pompey as it is affectionately known, because he is a devoted soccer fan himself. He even invited Ferrell to matches leading to his investment in Leeds. Eisner’s goal is getting Portsmouth back into the prestigious Premier League by building it up organically. What's more, he wanted it to be the springboard for a behind the scenes show along the lines of the hit Ryan Reynolds Disney+ docuseries Welcome to Wrexham. Eisner revealed the rationale behind it in a 2019 interview with this author for the Daily Mail at his office in Beverly Hills. When asked why a media boss would want to own a soccer team he replied “football is the most direct [investment of my] media strategy. It is the most obvious and the clearest as opposed to the least obvious.” He explained that “content, in my opinion, is still the essential ingredient in the media and having content is still the most important thing in media...Any platform that is appealing to an audience has to have something that lights up the Christmas Tree. And what lights up the Sky Christmas Tree or the ESPN Christmas Tree is live sports.” Known as appointment viewing because fans have to tune in at a specific time to watch it live, sport commands premium prices by broadcasters. "The only thing that demands viewing when it happens is sports. Yes, you have replays and you have all sorts of analysis of sports but if you know the score at the end of the game, the rest is really just icing on the cake." The drama of live sport also yields immensely passionate fans who crave content about their heroes. It explains why Welcome to Wrexham has been so popular but it wasn't the first mover in the streaming space. That accolade goes to Sunderland Til I Die, a 2018 Netflix series about the disputes and dilemmas behind the scenes at Sunderland AFC which had just been relegated from the English Football League Championship to League One. As Eisner explained, "all you have to do is watch Sunderland Til I Die on Netflix to understand the emotion of a team going into dissent." In fact, it was this show that convinced the actor Rob McElhenney to buy a soccer team leading to his investment in Wrexham with Reynolds. At the end of last season Wrexham was promoted to the Championship, one step below the Premier League. The odds seemed stacked against Eisner getting Portsmouth back to the top as English soccer is full of team owners who are prepared to pour billions into their squads in a bid to win on the pitch and earn international acclaim. However, afer seven calendar years in charge, his happy ending is within striking distance. Portsmouth won the League One title in the 2023-2024 season and was promoted to the Championship after a 12-year absence. Since then, the team has retained its place there and will make a renewed charge for promotion to the Premier League when the upcoming season gets underway on Friday. Perhaps indicating Eisner’s confidence in its chances, he recently announced that Portsmouth is planning to film behind-the-scenes content over the coming year. It is a momentous milestone as it will give him the content he envisaged back in 2019. Most impressively, Eisner has managed to get this far without burning up blockbuster losses and putting the team in jeopardy. Quite the opposite actually as analysis of its latest financial statements reveals that the team now has the strongest capital structure in its 127-year history with no debt and net assets of $33.5 million (£26.5 million) as of June 30, 2024. Its net asset value has increased more than five fold since the supporters took over the club in 2013 which shows how strong the business has become. The metric is calculated by deducting a company’s liabilities from the value of its assets so the higher the value, the lower the level of risk. The net result can be a sign of impending peril and, testimony to this, Portsmouth had net liabilities of $93.8 million (£47.5 million) in 2008 before it collapsed less than two years later. Since Eisner bought the team its cash reserves have risen 16.3% to $3.9 million (£3.1 million) which also gives strong confidence in the business. Its success has been shared amongst its staff as their pay has almost doubled to $13.4 million (£10.6 million) since Eisner took control even though employee numbers have decreased by 26.1% to 275. Staff and players were paid bonuses after the team was promoted and this partly fueled a $7.1 million (£5.6 million) net loss last year which pales in comparison to the red ink burned up by its counterparts in the Premier League. Everton FC for example reported a $67.3 million (£53.2 million) net loss last year whilst Tottenham Hotspur lost $33.1 million (£26.2 million). Both clubs have hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue as they share in the proceeds of the league’s broadcast deals which are amongst the biggest in world soccer. It explains why Portsmouth's revenue is far lower though it rose 8.9% last year to $17.2 million (£13.6 million), the highest level since Eisner bought the team. Last year alone, matchday takings increased 6.3% to $8.7 million (£6.9 million) whilst broadcasting revenue rose by almost double that percentage to $3.2 million (£2.5 million). The increased broadcast exposure gave a 21.4% boost to the team’s commercial and sponsorship revenue with partners including Nike and Uber Eats paying a total of $2.3 million (£1.8 million) in 2024. It was a family effort as the team is run by Eisner’s dynamic entrepreneur sons Anders, founder of organic foods brand Good Culture, producer Eric and director Breck who made 2005 adventure film Sahara starring Matthew McConaughey and Penélope Cruz. They are accompanied by talented managers including chief executive Andrew Cullen, chief marketing officer Matthew Barker, chief commercial officer Mark Judges and the coach John Mousinho. Although Eisner’s spending on Portsmouth hasn't been unchained, he hasn't left the club wanting. Its 2018 financial statements revealed that "the purchase of the club by Tornante resulted in an injection of £10 million [$13.2 million] new working capital which bolstered the balance sheet to a new positive total of £12.6 million [$16.6 million] net assets." It didn't stop there. As of June last year the Eisner family had invested $46.8 million (£37 million) in the club including $24 million (£19 million) alone on the redevelopment of its Fratton Park stadium. This began in June 2021, well ahead of the club's 125th anniversary, and was handled by Robert Stern who Eisner knew through his work at Disney. Stern designed Disney's Feature Animation Building in Burbank, California, with its soaring blue replica of Mickey Mouse's pointy sorcerer's hat. Stern was also behind Walt Disney World's lavish Yacht and Beach Club Resorts, which look like sprawling New England mansions, and their counterpart at Disneyland Paris, the Newport Bay Club. His work on Fratton Park had a magic touch as average attendance increased by around 1,000 to 18,952 in the year to June 30, 2024 and on February 17 last year Portsmouth had its first crowd of more than 20,000 spectators in 13 years. Its latest financial statements add that "in the second half of the season, we capped our season tickets to 15,000 and introduced a season ticket waiting list at Fratton Park for the first time in many years." In turn, the surge in spectators led to record hospitality kiosk and merchandising sales which is perhaps as significant a home run as the team's success on the pitch. "It is a game about winning. It is a game about progressing upwards. It is a game about strategy. It is a game about intelligent management," says Eisner. "Just like in the entertainment business."

August 04, 2025 17:00 ET | Source: Broadcom Inc. Broadcom Inc. PALO ALTO, Calif., Aug. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO), a global leader in semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, today announced it is now shipping the Jericho4 ethernet fabric router — a purpose-built platform for the next generation of distributed AI infrastructure. Designed to interconnect over one million XPUs across multiple data centers, Jericho4 breaks through traditional scaling limits with unmatched bandwidth, security, and lossless performance. With the Tomahawk 6, Tomahawk Ultra and Jericho4, Broadcom offers a complete networking portfolio for HPC and AI. As AI models grow in size and complexity, the infrastructure requirements exceed the power and physical limits of a single data center. Distributing XPUs across multiple facilities — each provisioned with tens to hundreds of megawatts of power — requires a new class of router, optimized for very high-bandwidth, secure and lossless transport across regional distances. “The Jericho4 family is engineered to extend AI-scale Ethernet fabrics beyond individual data centers, supporting congestion-free RoCE and 3.2 Tbps HyperPort for unprecedented interconnect efficiency,” said Ram Velaga, senior vice president and general manager of Broadcom’s Core Switching Group. “Scale Up Ethernet (SUE), Tomahawk Ultra, Tomahawk 6, and Jericho4 all play a very important role in enabling large scale distributed computing systems within a rack, across racks, and across data centers in an open and interoperable way.” A single Jericho4 system scales to 36,000 HyperPorts, each operating at 3.2 Tb/s, with deep buffering, line-rate MACsec, and RoCE transport over 100km+ distances. Broadcom’s 3.2T HyperPort technology consolidates four 800GE links into a single logical port — eliminating load balancing inefficiencies, boosting utilization by up to 70%, and streamlining traffic flow across large fabrics. Thanks to deep buffering and intelligent congestion control, Jericho4 ensures lossless RoCE across 100km+ enabling truly distributed AI infrastructure unconstrained by power and space limitations at a single location. Jericho4 supports MACsec encryption on every port at full speed to protect data moving between data centers, delivering strong security without compromising performance — even at the highest traffic loads. Manufactured on a 3nm process, Jericho4 features Broadcom’s advanced 200G PAM4 SerDes with industry-leading reach. This eliminates the need for extra components like retimers, resulting in lower power usage, reduced cost, and higher system reliability. Jericho4 is fully compliant with specifications developed by the Ultra Ethernet Consortium (UEC), ensuring interoperability across open, standards-based Ethernet AI fabrics. This allows seamless integration with a broad ecosystem of UEC-compliant NICs, switches, and software stacks. Learn More Visit the Jericho4 product page here.

Arrcus’ ArcOS software enables Jericho4 offering from Broadcom, with a disaggregated, carrier-grade software stack for high-performance, programmable networks across edge, core, and multi-cloud environments. Together with Broadcom, we’re delivering the agility and operational simplicity required for AI data center interconnects, 5G transport, and beyond.” Ido Susan, CEO & Founder, DriveNets “DriveNets Network Cloud-AI has already established industry-leading performance in Ethernet-based AI networking, powering Jericho3-based white boxes in a distributed disaggregated model. With the deep-buffer and low-latency capabilities of Jericho4, we are poised to deliver even greater AI networking scalability and performance, enabling a unified, high-efficiency solution for both AI back-end fabrics and storage networks in support of next-generation AI infrastructure demands." Andrew Qu, CEO, Micas Networks “Jericho4’s deep buffers, long-reach RoCE, and HyperPort innovation are exactly what our customers need to stitch together massive AI fabrics across data centers and metro regions. Combined with Tomahawk, Broadcom gives us the complete toolbox to build high-performance networks at any scale—from leaf-spine clusters to region-wide AI interconnects.” Ariff Premji, VP Customer Engineering, Nexthop AI "Modern day Hyperscaler AI clusters continue to outgrow the power and physical footprint of a single data center building. Cloud providers now have to build larger clusters that are distributed across multiple locations and diverse geographies. Broadcom's Jericho4 family of devices, supporting deep buffer, lossless Ethernet, RoCE, MACsec and advanced congestion management capabilities over long distances, now enable Nexthop to provide scalable network architecture options from a single rack to Gigawatt scale AI clusters."

Stock market rally today has captured Wall Street’s attention as the Dow Jones jumped 500 points, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also posting strong gains. This sharp rebound follows a weak U.S. payroll report, which has increased hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts as early as September. With only 73,000 jobs added in July and unemployment ticking up, investors now expect multiple interest rate cuts by the end of 2025. President Donald Trump’s strong reaction to the data, including the firing of the BLS chief, adds political drama as markets shift.

August 04, 2025 15:43 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- National plaintiffs’ law firm Berger Montague PC announces a class action lawsuit against Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) (“Novo” or the “Company”) on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded securities of Novo from May 7, 2025 through July 28, 2025 (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Novo securities during the Class Period may, no later than September 30, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Novo, headquartered in Denmark, is a global pharmaceutical company. According to the Complaint, the Company is alleged to have understated the impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion, which has allowed persistent use of compounded alternatives to Novo’s pharmaceutical products. Novo allegedly overstated the likelihood that patients using less expensive compounded drugs would switch to its branded products, thus greatly overstating the Company’s ability to sustain long-term growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook for fiscal 2025. The Company cited slower-than-expected growth for both Wegovy® and Ozempic®, attributing the guidance revision to continued competition from compounded GLP-1 products. Following this announcement, Novo’s stock price dropped from a closing price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, to a close of $53.94 per share on July 29—a decline of approximately 21.83% in a single day.

Title: Watch These Novo Nordisk Stock Price Levels After Last Week's 33% Drop

Time Published: 2025-08-04T18:29:55Z
Full Content:
Novo Nordisk's (NVO) U.S.-listed shares were up about 2% in recent trading after shedding about a third of their value last week, when the company cut its full-year outlook and named a new CEO, leading Wall Street analysts to downgrade the stock. Since hitting a record high in June last year, Novo Nordisk shares have lost roughly two-thirds of their value, pressured by increasing competition from rival Eli Lilly’s (LLY) weight-loss drugs and challenges during trials of the company’s next-generation obesity drugs. Below, we take a closer look at Novo Nordisk’s weekly chart and use technical analysis to identify major price levels that investors will likely be watching after last week’s dramatic sell-off. With last week's drop, Novo Nordisk shares resumed their steep downtrend on above-average trading volume, indicating selling conviction from larger market participants. The sell-off coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) falling to its lowest levels since early May, signaling weakening price momentum, though the indicator neared its oversold threshold, increasing the chances for short-term bounces. It’s also worth noting that the 50-week moving average continues to converge toward the 200-week MA, potentially setting the stage for an ominous death cross, a bearish pattern that forecasts lower prices. Let’s identify two major support levels on Novo Nordisk’s chart worth watching if selling resumes this week and also point out several key overhead areas to monitor during potential recovery efforts. The first major lower level to watch sits around $36. This area would likely provide support near the upper range of a consolidation period that formed on the chart between October 2020 and April 2021. A more significant move lower could see the shares test lower support at the $29 level. Investors may look for buying opportunities in this area near a horizontal line that connects a range of corresponding price action on the chart between January 2018 and April 2020. An initial recovery effort could see the shares climb to overhead resistance around $60. The price may encounter selling pressure in this area near the prominent April trough and April 2022 peak. A more bullish upswing opens the door for a rally toward $78. Investors who have bought Novo Nordisk shares at lower levels may decide to lock in profits in this location near the June peak, which closely aligns with the completion of a pullback in July 2023.

Title: Amazon layoffs: 110 jobs to be cut as part of Wondery podcast studio overhaul

Amazon.com is restructuring the Wondery podcast studio by shifting its award-winning narrative podcasts such as "Business Wars" to Audible and consolidating creator-led shows into a new unit, according to a memo seen by Reuters. About 110 employees will be laid off as part of the process, while many Wondery employees will transition to other parts of Amazon, the company said in an emailed statement on Monday. Wondery CEO Jen Sargent will depart the company following a transition period, the memo said. Intense competition in the expensive podcast industry as well as a growing focus on creator-led video content have prompted audio streaming companies including Spotify to diversify their podcasts as they look to lower costs and attract more users to their platforms. "As video podcasting has grown in popularity, we have learned that creator-led, video-integrated shows have different audience needs and require distinct discovery, growth and monetization strategies compared to audio-first, narrative series," Steve Boom, vice president of audio, Twitch and games at Amazon, wrote in the memo. Wondery was acquired by Amazon in 2021 and has seen podcast revenue quadruple since then as the studio expanded its slate to include video podcasts and creator-driven series, according to the memo. Under the new structure, Wondery's narrative podcast studio - home to shows such as "Dr. Death" and "American Scandal" - along with the Wondery subscription service, will move to Audible, the e-commerce giant's audio platform. Its creator-focused podcast team that produces shows including "Mind the Game", "New Heights", and "Armchair Expert" will join a new Creator Services group within Amazon's Talent Services division. This new team will continue to operate the creator-focused podcast studio under the Wondery brand. "By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels," Amazon said. Bloomberg News first reported on the Wondery overhaul.

According to the filing, the CoinShares Solana Staking ETF will hold SOL but also stake “a portion” of its holdings, with BitGo set to serve as the fund’s custodian and its staking partner. CoinShares doesn’t specify the likely percentage of the fund’s holdings that will be staked, but it does acknowledge the hypothetical risk that it may “become unable to timely meet excessive redemption requests in amounts that are greater than the portion of the Trust’s SOL that remains un-staked.” Despite this potential risk, the CoinShares Solana Staking ETF joins several similar filings in recent weeks, with the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale and 21Shares all applying to add staking to their existing Ethereum ETFs. Invesco Galaxy has also filed an application for its own Solana staking ETF within the past week, while the Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF launched last month after gaining automatic approval under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The latter fund attracted $12 million in first-day inflows and currently has assets under management of $137 million, indicating considerable early demand for Solana ETFs. The potential for growth in such funds has also been underlined by the recent successes of Ethereum ETFs, which now boast a total AUM of $27.5 billion, according to the latest CoinShares Digital Asset Fund Flows report. The past month has seen record inflows into ETH ETFs, which grew by $5.24 billion between July 1 and August 1, according to data from Farside. This is roughly comparable to the $5.5 billion in Bitcoin ETF inflows over the same period, whereas Solana funds grew by only $137 million, thanks to the aforementioned Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF. In total, Solana-based funds currently boast an AUM of $2.4 billion, which is only 8.7% of the equivalent total for Ethereum funds, whereas Solana’s market cap is approximately 20% of ETH’s. However, while demand for Solana (and altcoin) ETFs is likely to rise in the coming months, some analysts don’t think the inclusion of staking will make a substantial difference. This is the view of Bryan Armour, Morningstar’s Director of ETF & Passive Strategies, who tells Decrypt that he doesn’t expect staking alone to “meaningfully change” institutional demand. “Staking should make ETFs more efficient because they capture yield otherwise missed out on by unstaked spot ETFs, but the main driver of performance will be the underlying cryptocurrency,” he said. “I suspect institutional demand for staked Solana ETFs will come from the desire for diversified crypto exposures, like with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, in case one significantly outperforms or underperforms the others.” However, some industry figures do believe that staking will be an added draw for institutional investors, who previously may have been turned off by the perceived difficulty of staking for themselves. “Institutional demand for staking ETFs is rising fast as investors look for yield without the operational complexity of staking directly,” says James Harris, the Group CEO of DeFi platform Tesseract, speaking to Decrypt. According to Harris, such products will simplify access to protocols such as Ethereum and Solana, the latter of which currently has yields of between 7% and 8%. "It’s a natural evolution: If investors can choose between holding SOL alone or holding SOL while also earning a protocol-native yield, it’s a no-brainer that they’ll prefer the latter,” he added. On the other hand, Harris acknowledges that staking introduces some “execution risk” on top of standard custody and counterparty risk, although in his view the reward generally justifies the added complexity. In particular, the main execution risk involves the aforementioned difficulty of providing redemptions when most of a fund’s SOL is staked, something which Armour recognizes as the primary danger. “Un-staking could take anywhere from hours to several days, with the average time reportedly two to three days,” he explained. “ETF redemptions settle within one day, so the ETF cannot stake the entire portfolio and expect to meet redemptions.” Given this risk, Armour expects that most staking ETFs will ensure that enough of its holdings aren’t staked, although he also accepts that it’s possible that redemptions could exceed the liquid portion of a given fund, creating issues for the ETF and its market makers. He said, “In this scenario, I would expect the price of the ETF to trade at a discount to its net asset value, forcing investors to sell their shares at a discount if they wanted to get out.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Ethereum Explodes: 256K New Wallets in a Day as BlackRock’s ETH ETF Smashes $4B Inflows

Ethereum’s user base and network activity are surging, driven by a rapid spike in daily address creation. Calling out this development, market analyst Peter noted that Ethereum recently registered more than 256,000 new daily addresses, a surge seen only twice before. First, ahead of the 2017 bull run and right before ETH set new all-time highs of $4,878 in 2021. History may not repeat, but it’s echoing loudly. Therefore, Ethereum is experiencing a burst of attention and on-chain engagement, signaling a potentially bullish setup, with momentum building for a possible price breakout. At the time of this writing, Ethereum was up by 5.30% in the past 24 hours to trade at $3,643. Meanwhile, a renowned market analyst recently predicted that Ethereum could soar to $13,000 by Q4 2025, calling the target both bold and achievable. According to market analyst Peter, “ETH ETFs are finally waking up. In July alone, over $4B flowed into ETHA, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF. That’s a newmonthly record.” Therefore, as more capital flowed into BlackRock’s ETHA in a single month than ever before, a strong case is being made for the Ethereum ETF ecosystem because it has crossed the threshold into legitimacy. This explains why ETH is targeting the psychological price of $4,800 as BlackRock advances plans to enable staking in Spot ETH ETF.

By Cynthia Littleton Business Editor Amazon is reorganizing its audio entertainment operations with plans to consolidate some of the production now done across its Wondery and Audible brands. As a result of the changes, Wondery CEO Jen Sargent is exiting her post after four years at the helm of one of the industry’s largest podcast studios. Amazon disclosed the changes with an internal memo from Steve Boom, who is VP of audio, Twitch and games for Amazon. The reorganization will include about 100 layoffs.

Olympics Security in 2028 The Wondery brand will continue as an outlet for celebrity and personality driven podcasts such as Dax Shepard’s “Armchair Expert” and the recent deal that Wondery struck with NBA great LeBron James and football superstars Travis and Jason Kelce. Popular on Variety Wondery podcasts that were more narrative-driven such as true crime favorites “Dr. Death” and “Dirty John” will now shift under the Audible brand, which encompasses original audio production as well as a vast audio book library. Amazon acquired Wondery in 2020. In a statement, Amazon positioned the changes as a streamlining of audio content across the comapny’s vast media footprint. “The podcast landscape has evolved significantly in the past few years, particularly with the rise of video-forward, creator-led content. These changes reflect that evolution and will streamline how Wondery integrates further into Amazon,” Amazon said in a statement. “By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels, help them expand their brand IP, and simplify the process for advertisers while making content more accessible to audiences wherever they prefer to consume it. This evolution builds on Wondery’s early success with video-forward shows and positions us to better serve creators, customers, and advertisers.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: EA Explains Why Fans Aren’t Getting The Sims 5
URL: https://kotaku.com/sims-5-dynasty-warriors-remaster-call-duty-union-switch-2-2000614479
Time Published: 2025-08-04T14:48:55Z
Full Content:
Dynasty WarriorsThe Sims 5Unions Will global warming kill your Switch 2? Is EA really never going to make a sequel to The Sims 4? Why is Dynasty Warriors 3 objectively the best one in the series? These and more questions might get answered as we at Kotaku experiment with reviving our old Morning Checkpoint roundup series that used to run on the weekends. The idea is to briefly round up all the news and conversations that we might not otherwise have a chance to hit as individual breakout news stories but are otherwise worth knowing or fun to talk about, like the first Call of Duty developer union winning its first collective bargaining agreement. Here we go! That’s what EA entertainment president Laura Miele (she’s been at the company almost 30 years) told Variety when explaining why the hit life sim franchise has gone more than a decade without a direct sequel. âWhat I wouldnât want to have happen is you to have to start from day zero and start from scratch and give up all of the things that you have created, give up all of the content that youâve purchased over the years,â she said. âWe put out over 85 content packs over the last 10 years on The Sims 4, and so resetting that is not player friendly and not a good idea for our community.â What fans are getting is a Sims movie with help from Barbie‘s Margot Robbie. Which other EA franchises might get in on the current Hollywood gaming goldrush next? Miele currently has her eyes set on Apex Legends. Quality assurance devs at Call of Duty support studio Raven Software were the first Activision Blizzard staff to organize a union amid the 2021 workplace fallout, but then saw negotiations drag on for years as they accused the publisher of bad-faith bargaining tactics. Shannon Liao at Updater now reports that the Game Workers Alliance has finally ratified its contract, which among things “guarantees a 10 percent wage increase over two years.” It’s the second team at a Microsoft-owned studio to do so, with ZeniMax staff ratifying a contract in June just weeks before they were hit with mass layoffs. “If our unit of 19 people can do this, anybody can, as long as you’re committed to actually just doing the work and seeing it through to the end,” Erin Hall told Liao. Tomorrow it’s going to basically be 100 degrees in Kyoto, Japan, where Nintendo is headquartered. After a July that was the hottest month on record ever for Japan, the country is continuing to blaze through temperature records. Nintendo recently took the opportunity to remind fans that playing the Switch 2 in temperatures above 95 degrees is, uh, not great. “When using a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 in a high-temperature environment, the device’s temperature may rise,” the company posted. “This could potentially cause malfunctions, so please use it in a location between 5â35Â°C.” This isn’t the first time the company has had to issue a warning like this. It did a summertime PSA for the original Switch back in 2022. Everything is going great, folks. Koei Tecmo indicated that a game in the Dynasty WarriorsÂ series is getting remastered (but not which game) in a new trailer celebrating the series’ 25th anniversary. Dynasty Warriors Origins, the entry that came out earlier this year, is also getting more DLC, the company revealed. But longtime fans are more interested in which games from the franchise’s past will get modern updates. Dynasty Warriors 3, 4, and 5 are all top of mind for most, though a compilation of all three would probably be ideal. Hell, why not do the whole first six games? Over 1 million people claimed the FreedomToBuy bundle from GOG in its 48 hours of being available, the storefront reports. It included Postal 2, Agony, Fetish Locator Week One, and a bunch of even weirder stuff, “because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it.” The bundle was in response to the recent crackdown on NSFW games on Steam and itch.io due to payment processors. The year is more than half over and we still don’t know when Metroid Prime 4 is coming out. Some fans feared the game could slip to 2026 after it was a no-show during a recent Nintendo Partner Direct. But the company recently announced it will be playable at the Fan Expo Canada near the end of August. A November release date is feeling more and more likely. Someone on Reddit found a leaked Amazon listing for an 8bitdo Xbox controller commemorating the 40th anniversary of Rare, the studio best known for Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie, and Sea of Thieves, among other iconic classics. It’s $90 and looks very nice. There’s also a vinyl soundtrack collection and Evercade cartridges for old Rare games. Donât miss the latest reviews, news and tips. Sign up for our free newsletter.

"A legendary collaboration for a legendary milestone." As Rare - known for the likes of Sea of Thieves, Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong Country - gets ready to celebrate its 40th anniversary, a third-party licensed controller themed around the developer's legacy has leaked online. The controller itself has been built by gaming peripherals manufacturer 8BitDo, and officially licensed with Rare and Xbox. It features Hall Effect sticks, 'Pro Back Buttons' and has an integrated charging dock (via reddit). The controller is compatible with Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Android and iOS, and - according to the Amazon listing, which has gone live prior to any official announcement from the studio itself - this release will mark 8BitDo's first 2.4G wireless Xbox controller. "A legendary collaboration for a legendary milestone," reads the controller's Amazon page. "Wrapped in signature blue and gold, this special edition features symbolic patterns, game-inspired silhouettes and playful Easter eggs - a tribute to the legacy Rare brought to life." Those aforementioned silhouettes include bananas (a nod to Donkey Kong), feathers ( Banjo-Kazooie), tentacles (Sea of Thieves) and more. You can see how it looks via the images below. Amazon's sales page has the controller listed for $89.99, and at the time of writing it appears it will be only available across the pond in the US. Eurogamer has asked Microsoft for comment. This controller leaked on the same day Rare itself shared an anniversary post on social media, celebrating 40 years in the business. "From devoted Rare gamers to single-series stalwarts, we want to show our appreciation for anyone who's visited even just one of our worlds," it wrote, with an accompanying piece of art showing characters from Rare's games all gathered together in a theatre (see below). "For keeping an assorted ragtag of creatives working magic in the Midlands, only two words will do: THANK YOU." Of course, it has not been an easy time for Rare recently. Just last month, the studio's fantasy adventure Everwild was cancelled following layoffs at Xbox. Everwild was first revealed in late 2019. At this time, the game was said to be the next "large" project from Rare, and one that would co-exist with the ongoing development of Sea of Thieves. Soon after Everwild's cancellation, it was revealed Rare's most seasoned creator Gregg Mayles - known for directing the likes of Banjo-Kazooie and Sea of Thieves, as well as his work on Donkey Kong 64 and many more games - had left the studio after more than 35 years.

Title: State finance officials press US asset managers to denounce ESG, climate

Let ESG Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. A coalition of 26 Republican state finance officials sent letters to executives at 25 firms, pushing them to denounce climate and net-zero commitments. The push against the use of ESG factors, such as climate considerations in investment decisions and proxy engagement, follows Wall Street’s exodus from climate alliances earlier this year, spurred by mounting pressure from Republican-led state probes and changes in federal leadership. Such departures and climate commitment walkbacks have led to some states dropping previous state-level probes into the banks, including in Texas and Tennessee. The finance officials represent states including Alabama, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Utah. The letter tells asset management firms “seeking to do business” in those states that they should abandon framing climate change as a long-term risk and incorporating net-zero standards. the missive also asks firms to disclose any coalition or collaborative organizations they have memberships in and align proxy voting guidelines “with shareholder value, not environmental or social goals posed by activists.” “While some firms have recently taken encouraging steps, such as withdrawing from global climate coalitions and scaling back ESG rhetoric and proxy votes, and some states have permitted incremental reintegration, more work must be done,” the letter said. “The number one issue is a recommitment to the foundational principles of fiduciary duty, loyalty, objectivity, and financial focus.” The officials alleged that the “potential risks” of climate change “are framed as certain and catastrophic to justify forcing companies to take immediate actions that may not align with their long-term business interests.” Similarly, the letters frame issues like net-zero and CSRD incorporation and alignment as relying on “predetermined political outcomes, not fiduciary judgment.” The other firms who received the July 29 form letter include Affiliated Managers Group, Alliance Bernstein, BNY Investments and Wealth, Capital Group, Dimensional Fund Advisors, Fidelity Investments, Franklin Templeton, Geode Capital Management, MFS Investment Management, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, Neuberger Berman, Northern Trust, Nuveen, Prudential, Schwab Asset Management, T. Rowe Price, Wellington Management, and Wells Fargo Wealth and Investments. The state finance officials are seeking a response to their probe by Sept. 1 and have also encouraged targeted investment managers to engage with the offices of the undersigned treasurers, auditors, comptrollers and other state finance officials. According to the July 29 letter, some asset managers have already initiated correspondence with said state officials. Republican finance officials from Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming also signed onto the letter.

BitMine's rapid $2.9B ETH accumulation positions it third globally in crypto treasuries, capturing investor attention. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BitMine Immersion Technologies, the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, revealed that its total holdings are now at 833,137 ETH valued at over $2.9 billion, according to an Aug. 4 statement. This development places BitMine far ahead of previous frontrunner SharpLink, which reportedly holds 438,000 ETH. With this latest acquisition, BitMine has also climbed to third place globally in overall crypto treasuries, trailing only behind Bitcoin-focused entities Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and BTC miner Marathon Digital Holdings. Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine’s board and co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, said: “BitMine moved with lightning speed in its pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH growing our ETH holdings to over 833,000 from zero 35 days ago. We have separated ourselves among crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high liquidity of our stock.” BitMine’s stock, trading under the ticker BMNR, has seen a sharp increase in market activity. Data from Fundstrat shows that BMNR averaged $1.6 billion in daily trading volume over the past five days, ranking 42nd among all US-listed stocks, just behind ride-hailing giant Uber. Alongside higher trading volumes, BitMine’s stock price has surged more than 300% since it launched its ETH strategy. That rise appears driven by growing institutional interest, with key investors now including Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest and Bill Miller III, a senior advisor at both Miller Value Partners and Patient Capital Management. Miller, who famously backed MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin pivot in 2020, sees a familiar pattern at BitMine. According to him: “What is intriguing is BitMine is set to be very profitable once the Company turns on ETH staking. In my experience, the best management teams make rational decisions based upon evidence, exhibit independent thinking, and allocate capital with an objective of earning returns above the cost of capital.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

A Texas federal court has ruled against dismissing a lawsuit that implicates several of the world’s leading asset management firms in an alleged scheme to manipulate the coal industry. US District Judge Jeremy Kernodle has determined that most of the claims, which suggest that BlackRock, Vanguard Group, and State Street’s asset management branch engaged in anti-competitive behaviour, warrant further examination in court. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more In the ruling, Kernodle said the states “have identified enough circumstantial evidence to suggest that defendants agreed to collectively pressure coal companies to reduce the output of coal in the relevant markets and disclose future output information.” The legal action, spearheaded by Attorney General Paxton in November 2024, accused the asset managers of leveraging their substantial holdings to influence coal companies to cut production by 50% by the year 2030, aligning with certain environmental objectives. This purported collusion is said to have artificially constrained supply, driving up electricity costs and resulting in significant profit increases for the investment firms—allegations that the defendants had sought to dismiss. Paxton said: “BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—three of the most powerful financial corporations in the world—created an investment cartel to illegally control national energy markets and squeeze more money out of hardworking Americans. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. “Today’s victory represents a major step in holding them accountable. I will continue fighting to protect Texas and defend America’s energy independence from this unlawful conspiracy.” The Trump administration initiated legal action in May 2025.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices have swung wildly over the last week after a $300 billion sell-off sparked fears of a crypto crash. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has lost almost 10% since hitting an all-time high of $123,000 per bitcoin, with analysts speculating a bitcoin price game-changer could have already quietly happened. Now, as fears swirl around the future of the U.S. dollar, Wall Street giant BlackRock could be poised to extend its huge bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) lead over its rivals. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week authorized the use of in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms for bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The long-awaited move is part of the SEC’s overhaul of former chair Gary Gensler’s preference for crypto exchange-traded products to be cash only, which was perceived to be a barrier to efficiency for institutional market makers. “It’s a new day at the SEC, and a key priority of my chairmanship is developing a fit-for-purpose regulatory framework for crypto asset markets,” SEC chair Paul Atkins said in a statement. “The biggest takeaway is symbolic. It means there is a new sheriff in town,” Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told the financial newswire. "Gensler’s SEC did not want this to happen. This is the first of what will be several steps toward a more pro-crypto SEC.” BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager which runs the dominant spot bitcoin ETF with $85 billion in assets under management, filed a request in January to allow in-kind transactions. Others, including Fidelity, which runs the second-largest bitcoin fund with $23 billion in assets under management, followed suit. BlackRock, which manages around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024 that now hold almost 1.5 million bitcoin worth $170 billion. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious BlackRock’s fund alone holds 3.5% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth almost $85 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network. Alongside the authorization of in-kind crypto ETFs, the SEC has also approved a Nasdaq proposal to increase a position limit for options on BlackRock’s IBIT to 250,000 contracts, up from 25,000, expected to "help bring in bigger institutions and be helpful during volatility,” Balchunas posted to X. While BlackRock’s bitcoin fund is expected to benefit from the change, the second-largest bitcoin fund, run by Fidelity, could see its market share shrink, according to NYDIG’s global head of research Greg Cipolaro. “The change is likely to widen the monstrous lead that IBIT already has over the other players, while it hobbles [Fidelity’s] position as the second-largest options player,” Cipolaro wrote in a report. “As volatility declines, [bitcoin] becomes more investable for institutional portfolios seeking balanced risk exposure. This dynamic could reinforce spot demand. With risk-parity pioneer Ray Dalio recently advocating for a 15% portfolio allocation to gold and crypto in the face of ballooning government debt, the feedback loop of falling volatility leading to increased spot buying could become a powerful driver of sustained demand.” Last week, legendary billionaire Ray Dalio set markets alight when he recommended a 15% bitcoin or gold portfolio allocation, warning the Federal Reserve has been caught up in debt “doom loop" and that the dollar is past the “point of no return.”

Title: Storage innovation surges to keep pace with AI shift to inference
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/opinion/Storage-innovation-surges-to-keep-pace-with-AI-shift-to-inference
Time Published: 2025-08-04T11:32:00Z
Full Content:
We provide market insights, research and advisory, and technical validations for tech buyers. In the fast-paced, whack-a-mole world of AI infrastructure, innovation in one area has a habit of creating fresh challenges in another. As AI attention increasingly shifts to the "value" phase -- inference -- a new set of issues is emerging for those running AI workloads at large scale. Notably, these are driving a fascinating new wave of innovation in the storage and data ecosystem that will likely have implications as more regular enterprises get on board with advanced inferencing. It's already clear that the underlying data infrastructure plays a critical role when running AI at scale. Indeed, research from Enterprise Strategy Group, now part of Omdia, found that data management issues are a top-two challenge for organizations deploying AI workloads. But, as the emphasis of AI rapidly shifts to advanced reasoning and agentic inferencing, those challenges are set to grow, potentially significantly. In such advanced inferencing scenarios, there's a ton of focus on the specific challenges associated with growing context windows. Broadly, these windows refer to the amount of tokens an AI model can consider at one time when generating a response or prediction. Context windows are growing in terms of both scale and complexity as users become more proficient with AI reasoning tools and expectations grow. Not only are users asking more sophisticated questions, but they are doing so over extended time periods. Think about how you may have interacted with a generative AI tool and then perhaps returned with a follow-up question several minutes or even hours later. Did you expect the model to remember where you left off? Additionally, prompts can now handle data types beyond text, increasingly supporting content such as PDFs, code and even video. This is leading to an explosion in the number of tokens generated for each prompt. As an example, Llama 1 supported a context window of 2,048 tokens when Meta released it in 2023. By contrast, earlier this year, Meta released Llama 4, which has support for up to 10 million tokens -- a 5,000 times increase. The "10 million tokens" problem may be more of a theoretical limit than an actual problem that is felt today, but there is broad agreement that, regardless of the size of the environment, a wave of tokens is heading toward us. This tsunami will likely overwhelm today's infrastructure, so alternatives are required. The key-value (KV) cache is where the context window is built and stored and, as such, is a critical -- and highly compute-intensive -- step in the reasoning process for large language models (LLMs). It's where the contextual understanding of the input request is built; think of it as the short-term memory of the LLM. The challenges associated with storing hundreds of thousands or even millions of tokens mean that, in more demanding or sophisticated environments, the KV cache quickly fills up. In such a scenario, older data must be evicted to accommodate new requests. To regain context, older prompts must then be repeatedly recalculated. The "GPU tax" comes into play here. Rather than using expensive GPU cycles to create new insights, they must instead spend time recalculating data they have already created. That's an inefficient use of an expensive resource. The KV cache was originally designed to deliver high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is pinned to the local GPU server. Tools such as vLLM have emerged as popular and efficient ways to manage data here. However, HBM is the most expensive form of memory, and as token counts grow, so does the need for a larger KV cache. Accordingly, it becomes necessary to use additional memory resources. The next obvious step in the memory hierarchy is CPU memory -- DRAM. Here, frameworks such as LMCache enable KV cache offloading to local CPU memory. But, as context windows and their associated tokens grow exponentially, this is not necessarily enough either. To cost-effectively meet the performance needs of advanced AI inferencing in the future, GPUs will likely need a KV cache that taps a larger pool of high-performance storage, such as NVMe. This would help context windows to dramatically expand, enabling GPUs to focus more of their time serving new prompts, while simultaneously boosting overall efficiency. Managing KV cache data this way also potentially brings other benefits, managing data on a global, more intelligent basis that can serve a wider variety of purposes. Given the stakes, it's not surprising that multiple industry players are intently focused on addressing this challenge. Overall, the storage for AI space has seen strong development in recent years, as suppliers have worked to overcome a range of AI-related performance challenges. We've seen the emergence of AI-focused storage specialists, each with their own technical approaches based on advanced data management software architectures and utilizing advancements in fast remote direct memory access technologies and protocols. In addition, we're currently seeing a surge of activity around advanced inferencing specifically, including KV cache management. For example, earlier this year, Weka announced a capability it calls Augmented Memory Grid (AMG), which is due for general availability in the fall. This feature uses Weka's parallel file system software to create an external pool of shared NVMe storage, which is attached directly to GPU servers and persists as a high-performance token warehouse. It drives memory-like performance but at NVMe costs, Weka said. AMG can also run in conjunction with Weka's recently announced NeuralMesh Axon software, which implements its software stack entirely in the GPU server to take advantage of underused NVMe flash storage within the server itself. Indeed, Weka said customers will experience far greater value when running the two aspects together. Though the technical implementation differs, Vast Data's Undivided Attention (VUA) feature, also announced earlier this year, offers similar capabilities. It uses Vast's Disaggregated Shared Everything architecture, in the process creating what it terms an "infinite memory space for context data." Like Weka's AMG, VUA is optimized for vLLM frameworks. DDN is joining the party with the new Infinia object storage. It has a KV cache embedded directly within it; DDN recently detailed a test scenario it said delivers the fastest Time to First Token in the industry for advanced reasoning workloads. Notably, Nvidia is also focused on addressing these challenges. Nvidia's play here, announced earlier this year, is Dynamo, a low-latency distributed framework for scaling reasoning AI models. One of the several innovations within Dynamo, which supports existing frameworks such as vLLM, is KV Cache Manager. The feature enables the offloading of older or less frequently accessed KV cache blocks to more cost-effective memory and storage, such as CPU memory, local storage or external networked storage. Nvidia said this approach can support petabytes of KV cache data to be stored at a fraction of the cost of storing it in GPU memory. Exactly how this will play with the various offerings from storage vendors is still to be determined. To some degree, Nvidia is offering an alternative approach here. However, Vast, Weka and others said they are working with Nvidia to offer integration between their capabilities and Dynamo. The new Nvidia Inference Transfer Library (NIXL), a high throughput, low-latency point-to-point communication library, provides a consistent data movement API to move data rapidly and synchronously across different tiers of memory and storage. Optimized specifically for inference data movement, NIXL supports different types of memory, local SSDs and, crucially, networked storage from Nvidia storage partners. Storage vendors are already working to achieve integration with NIXL. Weka has open sourced a dedicated plugin for NIXL. Meanwhile, Vast recently shared details of a test scenario that integrated the Nvidia NIXL GPUDirect Storage (GDS) plugin with the Vast AI OS. The test, Vast said, drove a single H100 GPU at 35 GBps using GDS without saturating the Vast AI OS' available throughput. In other words, storage would not be a bottleneck when offloading LLM KV caches to the Vast platform. It's tempting to view such context window challenges as something that should only concern a small number of large-scale AI builders, hyperscalers, neoclouds/AI service providers, large research institutions and so on. Such an assumption may be dangerous. Although it's true that handling millions of tokens over thousands of GPUs is still the preserve of very few, more mainstream enterprises are starting to get their hands dirty with advanced reasoning and agentic AI. Such deployments may only amount to tens of GPUs, but the prompts will likely be just as sophisticated. So, the need to effectively marshal a large volume of tokens will be just as critical, perhaps even more so, given the resource constraints. Hence, any infrastructure leaders contemplating their organization's inference journey should keep a close eye on developments here. The range of options for customers continues to grow and will likely expand further over the coming months. Mainstream storage providers -- including Dell, such as with Project Lightning; NetApp; and Pure Storage with FlashBlade//EXA -- are all sharpening their AI wares, and AI storage specialists, such as Hammerspace, are increasingly targeting the broader enterprise opportunity. Ultimately, the inference-specific issues detailed here are but one aspect of a much broader set of memory-, storage- and data-related challenges that organizations will face as they scale their AI workloads. The real trick for infrastructure leaders will be to build an AI environment that can elegantly handle these issues alongside the myriad additional challenges they face. In this respect, the ongoing innovations from across the supplier ecosystem augur very well for the future.

Title: SEC Is Now All In On Crypto. What’s Next?

Time Published: 2025-08-04T10:05:00Z

The agency approved in-kind redemptions for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last week, but the move may just the beginning for Atkins’ SEC. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Crypto funds are about to become a whole lot more regulated — or deregulated, depending on who you ask. After initial delays, the SEC has approved in-kind redemptions for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The decision is the first pro-crypto policy decision by Paul Atkins, the SEC chair confirmed earlier this year who is expected to help realize crypto evangelists’ digital currency dreams. The move also is the first major indication that the crypto industry — whose super PACs donated tens of millions to President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign — is getting what it expected. The decision marked “the biggest day for crypto in the history of the space,” said financial consultant Tyrone Ross Jr. “This administration, whether it’s custody, whether it’s on-chain, whether it’s ETFs … they’re making sure that crypto thrives in America.” In-kind redemptions let investors create and redeem shares of spot crypto ETFs without having to use cash — meaning authorized participants, the people with the power to change the number of ETF shares on the market, can now add or remove assets from a fund using Bitcoin or Ethereum. In a statement on the approval, Atkins said the decision is only the first step toward building “a rational regulatory framework for crypto.” But how much of these changes can be attributed to the Trump administration? “One hundred percent,” said Ross. “They are hell-bent on America becoming the main hub for crypto in the world.” Other measures approved by the agency were: The SEC’s likely next move is specifying which coins are and aren’t securities, Ross said. “That’s the big one that everyone is still waiting for,” he said. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is also likely to eventually update its guidance on what it will oversee, he added. Keeping Options Open. In-kind redemption approvals took place alongside another policy change to increase positions limits for options trading on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, IBIT — the biggest crypto ETF on the market — from 25,000 to 250,000 contracts. BlackRock has been among the most prominent issuers pushing for deregulation, having filed for in-kind redemptions back in January. “It’s huge for the individual investor. It’s huge for BlackRock,” Ross said. “It’s huge for the entire space.” With the continent’s active ETF industry set to balloon to $1 trillion within the decade, stateside managers are joining the fray. Not since the pandemic have US gold ETFs seen such demand, with geopolitical and economic uncertainty driving people to the safe-haven asset. Financial services firms could test uses for AI in “regulatory sandboxes,” according to legislation introduced last week. Wealthier people are less likely to value financial advice, but there are consequences to trading ETFs outside of advisory relationships. Consistent income and returns that mute market highs and lows are what an aging population demands from an ETF, the company says. Bitcoin, Ether and other crypto ETFs are no longer limited to cash transactions — they can use in-kind creation and redemption. BlackRock and Vanguard have raked in cash in very different places, highlighting some of the differences in their ETF customer bases. Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has emerged as the lead market maker of the $34 million Capital Group US Large Growth ETF. The faith-based ETF segment focuses less on generating alpha and more on adhering to religious principles and values. The world’s leading beverage company plans to add a cane-sugar version of its namesake beverage in the US. The agency this week delayed approving Bitwise’s ETF conversion, a sign of hesitancy despite a crypto-friendly government. Crossmark, which provides similar values-screening strategies in SMAs, is applying them to a pair of ETFs. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: US Power Grab of Global Ports Runs Out of Steam Following Pressure From Beijing
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/08/us-power-grab-of-global-ports-runs-out-of-steam-following-pressure-from-beijing.html
Time Published: 2025-08-04T10:00:26Z
Full Content:
The US attempt to bring global ports under Western control in order to squeeze Beijing looks dead in the water. Despite Trump’s bluster, China quietly shut the scheme down. We’ll detail how they did so, but first the relevant background. Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings in March announced that it was selling all its overseas ports, including two at the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by BlackRock in a deal worth $23 billion. BlackRock was to take control of the two in Panama while the Italian tycoon-controlled Mediterranean Shipping Company controlled the others. It was sold as a major win for Washington on the geopolitical chess board—one that could raise prices on or refuse Chinese ships or allow the US to militarize the ports and use them to enact a maritime blockade of China at critical chokepoints. During his inaugural address, President Donald Trump said of the Panama Canal, “We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” Well, okay. But on July 27, the deadline to finalize the deal passed without anyone signing on the dotted line. That’s because Beijing saw the Trump administration conspiring with the takeover consortium while applying pressure on Hutchison and said two can play at that game. Beijing responded by launching a regulatory review of the deal —although the company’s base is in Hong Kong and there aren’t direct Chinese assets involved in the sale — and said the deal shouldn’t be implemented without its approval. If that warning wasn’t clear enough, the family of Hutchison founder Li Ka-shing, the ninety-six-year-old billionaire who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2000, saw their business empire come under pressure. From Bloomberg: Younger son Richard’s talks to expand his insurance business into mainland China have stalled after the ports deal upset Beijing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. That followed another Bloomberg report in March that China told its state-owned firms to hold off on any new collaboration with businesses linked to the Li family. The ports deal is now fully wrapped up in the ongoing trade and other tensions between Beijing and Washington. That’s a game that even Politico admits the US is losing—and badly, largely driven by Washington delusions: Panama isn’t 1989. There’s no Noriega to oust. There’s no Cold War to rally around. Today, China funds the projects. China builds the rails. China moves the cargo. (5/11) — William Huo (@wmhuo168) July 29, 2025 What Trump revealed in Panama was the depth of his illusion. He thinks he’s Machiavelli. In reality, he’s a failed landlord trying to evict China from global trade routes it already owns. (10/11) — William Huo (@wmhuo168) July 29, 2025 What Now? It looks like China will get its way. Here’s Bloomberg: CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. said it may invite a “major strategic investor” from China to join a group seeking to buy its global ports, as the Hong Kong-based company works toward a solution that pleases all in the geopolitically-sensitive deal. The unnamed investor would join as a significant member of the consortium, the company said in a stock exchange filing Monday, hours after the expiry of a 145-day exclusive talks window with the group backed by American asset manager BlackRock Inc. Will Trump still try to sell it as a major victory “retaking” Panama Canal? One would guess so, although he might have to wait a while. Lau Siu-kai, a consultant for the semi-official Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies think tank, told the South China Morning Post that he expected the deal deadline to be extended with China’s state-owned enterprise China Cosco Shipping Corporation potentially joining the consortium. The bottom line is that if China opposes the deal, it is “highly likely to be called off”. “If Cosco has some form of ownership and decision-making power in the ports’ future operations, ensuring that Chinese cargo ships and shipping companies are treated fairly and not discriminated against, then China’s key interests would be protected, and it would give the transaction a green light,” Lau said. Or as Bloomberg puts it: Challenges remain even as Cosco enters the discussions, David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors, wrote on financial analysis platform SmartKarma. That could reverse the current rhetoric and upset Trump, who has a handful of issues already on his plate, he said. No doubt. Cosco joining the consortium defeats the whole purpose of the deal Washington was supporting. Here’s the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council of China strongly-worded comment on the matter a few months back, and it’s hard to disagree with its argument that the proposed transaction was not an “ordinary commercial activity,” but rather a hegemonic act in which the US was employing state power—through coercion, pressure, and inducements—to seize the legitimate rights and interests of another country. Here’s more: Once the Panama Canal is “Americanized” and “politicized,” the United States will undoubtedly use it for political purposes to advance its own political agenda, and China’s shipping and trade will inevitably be controlled by the US. If the United States were to implement measures such as selective capacity restrictions or imposing “political surcharges,” Chinese companies’ logistics costs and supply chain stability would face great risks. Some netizens also noted that through this deal, BlackRock would control about 10.4% of the world’s container terminal throughput, joining the ranks of the world’s top three port operators, and it is entirely possible that it would work in concert with US policies to suppress China, raising costs for Chinese cargo and squeezing the market share of Chinese shipping companies. Moreover, this transaction creates a major gap in the port network that Chinese companies have built up over the years, thereby allowing American interests to erode their overseas development advantages. Other netizens even point out that the United States might use this transaction as a “template” to spark a wave of port mergers and acquisitions worldwide through political pressure, thereby controlling more critical ports globally and employing “long-arm jurisdiction” to suppress China, leaving Chinese vessels with “no reliable haven.” This is by no means mere fearmongering. According to a draft executive order from the US government, plans are already underway to charge Chinese vessels special docking fees, and the US will urge its allies to take similar measures, otherwise facing retaliation. If all of the United States’ calculated moves succeed, they will undoubtedly impact China’s shipbuilding, shipping, foreign trade, and even the Belt and Road Initiative, and will directly affect Hong Kong’s efforts to consolidate and elevate its position as an international shipping and trade center, while threatening and undermining the normal global order and safety of shipping and trade. So it’s unsurprising that Beijing threw its weight around to nix the deal. There was noise in the Western media that Beijing might have to use heavy-handed means to do so. Reuters opined that Beijing might use extra-territorial jurisdiction by applying its anti-monopoly law, claiming that the deal, even though outside mainland China, would affect, eliminate or restrict competition in China’s domestic market. Another option, according to Reuters, was the 2020 National Security Law, which goes after “terrorism,” subversives, secessionists, and colluders with foreign forces.” In the end, China didn’t even need to do much more than lift a finger, which likely hurts the fallback option. If China was forced to go the heavy-handed route, it was to be expected that it would hurt the Hong Kong financial center’s global standing as the US would paint Beijing as unfriendly to outside business interests. There are, of course, still claims of that sort percolating out: Xi’s China isn’t a market—it’s a trap. CK Hutchison begging for a CCP-approved investor shows how far business must crawl to feed Xi’s delusions of total control.👇 https://t.co/QSdIE8qOzZ — Jay T (@Jay83214566) July 28, 2025 Not sure how such claims fit with Trump huddling with BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink over the deal, the whole Tik Tok saga, and numerous other examples, but what do I know? Investors, however, are pumped by the potential inclusion of Cosco. From Bloomberg: Investors are regaining enthusiasm for CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. despite a delay in the company’s plan to sell 43 ports, with optimism fueled by news that a Chinese shipping behemoth is finding its way into the global deal. Shares of CK Hutchison, which oscillated between gains and losses since the company first announced the deal on March 4, reached the highest this year on Friday after state-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. emerged as a potential new member of the buyer consortium that includes American asset manager BlackRock Inc. That leaves the Trump administration in the unenviable position of trying to swim upstream against the interests of investors, logistics, and simple logic—increasingly familiar terrain for the US these days. Singapore’s PM has laid it out. He knows the U.S. has abandoned the multilateral trading system, upon which Singaporeans wealth is based. There’s only one stable force with the heft to anchor multilateral trade in this episode of disruption. It’s China. https://t.co/Zb0sZnEOZq — Warwick Powell | 鲍韶山 (@baoshaoshan) April 5, 2025 Will Washington accept reality? If recent history is any indication, that is unlikely. And there are plenty of other ways the US can try to shake things up and burn things down at maritime chokepoints in an effort to improve its bargaining position with Beijing. Trump continues to bomb away at Somalia making a bad situation worse. Meanwhile, Somaliland, which proclaimed independence from Somalia in 1991, is now offering the US a military base at the entrance to the Red Sea and critical-minerals deals if the US will recognize it as a state. That also happens to be what Project 2025 recommends, arguing that “the recognition of Somaliland statehood as a hedge against the U.S.’s deteriorating position in Djibouti.” That position in Djibouti is, of course, almost all about China. Down at the Cape of Good Hope, the US is in the midst of a pressure campaign on South Africa with an eye on a naval base there. Just recently the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a bipartisan(!) piece of legislation that would direct the president to assess whether South Africa is undermining U.S. national security or foreign policy objectives, and that means sanctions are likely incoming. There was also the fact that U.S. Southern Command was/is partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces and drawing up plans to seize the Panama Canal by force—only if necessary, of course. Does the failure of the Hutchinson deal and the overall inability of the US to effectively coerce Beijing make it more likely the US goes through with such threats? I guess we’ll have to wait and see. ‘Down at the Cape of Good Hope, the US is in the midst of a pressure campaign on South Africa with an eye on a naval base there. Just recently the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a bipartisan(!) piece of legislation that would direct the president to assess whether South Africa is undermining U.S. national security or foreign policy objectives, and that means sanctions are likely incoming.’ The South Africans, if they came under such an attack, should tell Washington that if they do not knock it off, that they will offer the Chinese and/or Russians a naval base in their country instead so wouldn’t they prefer a more neutral country? From what I have seen, once the US establishes a base in a foreign country and spend big money to build it up, the next step is to completely capture the host country so that there is no possibility of them being turfed out. South Africa would be no different. Another naval base as the US navy shrinks and cannot man what it has? Same old game from the old and increasingly tattered neocon/CIA/NGO playbook or beware the camel’s nose. I find it curious that in none of the discussions I have read is whether Blackrock will manage the ports as efficiently as under Chinese corporate ownership. China’s ports are by far the World’s most advanced (the automation and throughput are mind-blowing). The record of Black Rock with residential real estate and health care suggests it will maximize short-term profitability at the cost of long-term sustainability, shipping costs, and efficiency (maximizing shareholder value – not a surprise). Given that Ports are essential (and strategic, including military) infrastructure where costs (and thus profits) should be minimized to maximize shipping efficiency for the national benefit, often with significant state investment (e.g., the Ports of Los Angeles/Long Beach receiving multibillion-dollar electrification upgrades from US DOT grants). Such massive subsidies are of clear interest to Black Rock. But are such massive subsidies to Black Rock-controlled companies really in the public interest (or will they introduce friction into shipping)? As the US is now seeking to turn global Port infrastructure into a geostrategic weapon, a more direct governmental control of these infrastructure hubs, vital to China’s export economy, is consistent with Cosco playing a greater role to secure these assets against being used as a weapon against China.

Title: Why Platforms Like Substack Won't Make Sense for Much Longer
URL: https://danielmiessler.com/blog/future-of-substack
Time Published: 2025-08-04T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
I think the future of Substack is self-hosting. Or—more directly—I don't think they have much of a future. You've probably heard about Substack's issues—$585M valuation after failing to raise a Series C in 2022, the 14% staff layoffs, the major creator exodus in early 2024 over content moderation failures, and the fact that prominent writers like Casey Newton's Platformer jumped ship to competitors. Substack is showing all the classic warning signs of a dying platform (see below), but I care more about the fact that people had to go to Substack in the first place, and that they're now unhappy. To me it's part of a larger issue with the platforms in general. I've been blogging since 1999 and I've seen a few dozen of these platforms over the years. I've probably used nearly a dozen myself. I think the reason these platforms fail after a limited run is because they tend to toxify over time. I think, fundamentally, it's just hard to have a giant platform like this where the incentives can stay aligned with its users. So there are two main paths: Here's a not-even-comprehensive list of the platforms and why they're no longer around. Why it failed: Acquired by Twitter, then shut down Twitter acquired for talent, not product. Couldn't compete with Tumblr's growth. Shut down April 30, 2013. Peak: 4.5M monthly users. Why it failed: Lack of revenue, couldn't compete with Twitter Too complex (tried to combine microblogging, file sharing, events). Acquired by Six Apart and immediately shut down Dec 2008. Only had ~100k users at peak. Why it failed: Low engagement, poor features Microsoft auto-created accounts for all 500M Hotmail users but only 30M were active. Migrated to WordPress.com Sept 2010. Why it failed: Financial difficulties Pioneered blogging but couldn't afford servers. Shut down Feb 2014 after data loss. Relaunched 2018 as subscription-only. Why it failed: Legal battle (Hulk Hogan lawsuit) $140M verdict in lawsuit funded by Peter Thiel. Filed bankruptcy, shut down Aug 2016. Relaunched 2021 but minimal traffic. Why it failed: NSFW ban, cultural mismatch with Yahoo/VerizonLost 30% of traffic after Dec 2018 adult content ban. Sold by Yahoo for $1.1B (2013), later sold to Automattic for less than $3M (2019). Why it failed: Failed to gain traction Six Apart's attempt at "neighborhood blogging." Never exceeded 600k users. Shut down Sept 30, 2010. Why it failed: Still alive but stagnant under Google Acquired by Google 2003. Last major update 2020. Lost 90%+ market share to WordPress. Many features deprecated. Why it failed: Sold to Russian company, user exodusSold to SUP Media (Russia) 2007. Servers moved to Russia 2016, triggering privacy concerns and mass exodus. Why it failed: Failed to evolve, lost to Facebook/MySpace Peak: 40M users (2005). Shut down 2013, raised $60k to relaunch as "Xanga 2.0." Now basically dead. Why it struggles: Revenue model conflicts with customer needs Multiple layoffs: 2017 (50 people), 2021 (75), 2023 (unknown). Changed business model 5+ times. Major publications left platform. Why it failed: Failed to grow beyond niche Started as invite-only "elite" network. Opened to public 2014 but too late. No meaningful updates since. Estimated <10k active users. Why it failed: Struggles with mainstream adoptionRaised $5M+ via Kickstarter/revenue. Only ~2.5k paying Ghost(Pro) customers despite being around 10+ years. $200+/month pricing drives users to competitors. Why it failed: Lost creators to self-hosting While WordPress.org powers 43% of the web, WordPress.com has <0.4% market share. Creators graduate to self-hosted after hitting limitations. Why it failed: Creator exodus, content moderation crisisPlatformer, Casey Newton left Jan 2024 over Nazi content. Flat $585M valuation after failed Series C (2022). 14% layoffs June 2022. Top writers leaving to avoid 10% fee. Currently growing (benefiting from competitor issues) Founded by Morning Brew alumni. Raised $33M Series B at $192M valuation (Apr 2024). 100k+ newsletters, grew 10x in 2023. Flat pricing beats Substack's %. These seem to be some of the themes. So there's this massive history of these platforms rising up to consume the users fleeing the previous failure. Only to then fall apart themselves years later. Another way to make this point might be to ask why we needed these platforms in the first place? Why were there so many of these? And why did they do so well for so long? It's because individual writers couldn't do one or more of the following: Well, it's now a whole lot easier to do all three. Creating a website that hosts a blog is fairly trivial for AI today, and it will only become more trivial in the months and years to come. So any would-be writer can simply have AI help build them a blog. And it won't even have to look exactly like all the other pages, which is a problem on a site like Substack, who wants to maintain its own branding above that of the creator. Sending mass emails is still a bit of a dark art, but there are services like Amazon SES that AI could also use to build this infrastructure fairly easily. Not to mention using any of the other third-party services that are designed to help people do this. It just becomes a matter of integration with those tools, which AI is really good at. And finally, the benefit of a platform for getting eyes onto your content I think is diminishing as well. First of all, it's not clear to me that anyone on Substack is just getting tons of traffic by virtue of just being there. Second, I think sites like Google and other AI-powered platforms are going to get extremely good at finding the content jewels of what's publicly available and raising them up to others. Basically, AI-powered content discovery. And I think that will have far more impact at lifting the best content. The bottom line is, we're just going to be able to do these things on our own. The platforms tend to be extremely toxic and highly restrictive, and they don't last long anyway. And the only reason they existed in the first place is because it was hard to do the things that they provided. And now with AI, that is all going away.

Title: Apple sceptics have had to eat their words—at least for the time being

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Did US tariffs help Apple Inc achieve a blowout quarter? That was one theory that emerged as the company disclosed a surprising surge in iPhone sales in the April-June quarter, up 14% compared with the period a year earlier, handily beating estimates. Consumers, it was said, were rushing out to stores in fear that Donald Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ trade levies would drastically increase the cost of an upgrade; [reports had suggested that the price could have gone up by 43%]. It certainly makes some logical sense; though the data shows that the fears of consumers soon subsided. According to Placer.ai, which uses mobile location data to monitor foot traffic, elevated sales in the immediate days after Trump’s address rapidly petered out—visitors to US Apple stores were up just 0.93% for the entire fiscal quarter compared to a year earlier. Meanwhile, visits to Apple’s website from US consumers were down 3%, according to data from Similarweb. Also Read: Mint Quick Edit | India’s smartphone exports get buzzy in the US On a call with investors to discuss the results, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook acknowledged that tariff chatter did create unusual buying patterns in April, mostly around sales in the US of the iPhone and Mac computers. But overall, the boost was limited—Apple said just 1 percentage point of its 10% overall revenue growth came from these “pull forward" sales. If Apple’s analysis proves correct—and some analysts seemed sceptical, repeatedly asking for more details—then that would be good news. It means investors would have to worry less that the better-than-expected sales won’t mean a significant dip for the rest of this year. That’s not to say tariffs won’t be a drag— Cook said the company would take a $1.1 billion tariff-related hit in the current quarter, up from $900 million in the last. To emphasize the gusto of his most important product, Cook noted that somebody out there has the 3 billionth iPhone. That’s a staying power that will count for a lot as the company moves to this next era of uncertainty. Also Read: China plus one: Apple and India might need to woo not just Trump but Xi too The quarterly iPhone sales indicate that consumers don’t yet care that the bulk of the device’s artificial-intelligence (AI) features have yet to materialize—they’ll stick with Apple anyway. I found myself agreeing with Cook when he said he felt AI-specific devices—such as glasses from Meta Platforms Inc or whatever it is OpenAI and Jony Ive create—are “likely to be complementary devices, not substitution" for the smartphone. Still, AI is on the mind of investors, and the blockbuster quarter was not enough to distract from that; [notably, Apple’s stock has fallen by double digits since the beginning of the year]. The company reiterated its intent to increase spending to fund its AI efforts and to reallocate talent to speed things up. Cook didn’t, however, address the fact that some of his top AI talent has reallocated itself to Meta. The Apple boss’s apparent lack of interest in joining Big tech’s unprecedented talent war —one that would have made his predecessor, Steve Jobs, sick to his stomach—is one facet in Apple’s obvious unwillingness to follow its peers and bet the entire house on AI. Its capital expenditure, while growing, is expected to be tens of billions of dollars lower than that of other tech giants. The years to come will tell whether Apple was wise to separate itself from the pack. Also Read: Apple intelligence: It’s time to step up and speak out Tellingly, when asked last week whether Cook felt AI innovations like large language models might become commoditized, the CEO declined to answer. “That gives away some things on our strategy," he said. That could be read as a sign Apple doesn’t feel it needs to directly compete in building AI. I think this speaks of a confidence that the iPhone will still be the de facto device of choice for AI whether or not Apple is successful in making a competent ChatGPT of its own. Another interpretation is that Cook doesn’t want to show his hand in any merger and acquisition negotiations, but I guess we’ll see. Cook said on the call that he was “very open" to dealmaking—we’ll see what exactly he feels he needs to buy rather than build. Frankly, you didn’t need to see Apple’s numbers to know it had been a great quarter for the company—you could just listen to the tone of Cook’s voice. Noticeably upbeat as he ran through his remarks, the tenor of the call was in stark contrast from last quarter, when some (myself included) wondered whether the weight of Apple’s numerous challenges were starting to deplete the 64-year-old’s energy reserves. Talk of succession will surely quieten down for the foreseeable future: It’s time to let Tim cook. ©Bloomberg The author is Bloomberg Opinion’s US technology columnist.

Title: IDCC Hits Record Highs: Overheated Or Undervalued?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/04/idcc-hits-record-highs-overheated-or-undervalued/
Time Published: 2025-08-04T09:30:00Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. InterDigital (NASDAQ: IDCC) has increased by 16% over the last five trading days, achieving record highs close to $258 per share (as of July 31), fueled by a significant $1.05 billion arbitration victory against Samsung. However, the pressing question for investors is whether this surge is still sustainable or if the stock has exceeded its fundamental values. At first glance, IDCC’s valuation appears stretched. It has a price-to-sales ratio of 7.8x and a price-to-free-cash-flow multiple of 52.4x, significantly higher than the S&P 500 averages. Moreover, its trailing P/E of approximately 20x exceeds its 3-year historical range of 14x. However, context is essential. These high multiples indicate a company that is quickly scaling revenues, increasing margins, and demonstrating the reliability of its licensing model. Thus, although the valuation is high, it is not unreasonable. Strong execution, premium margins, and financial flexibility warrant a higher multiple. Still, after such a significant increase, a short-term correction would not be surprising. That being said, for those looking for upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Additionally, see META Stock to $1,500? InterDigital’s strength is anchored in its asset-light, high-margin licensing model, which is supported by upstream R&D in 4G/5G/6G, video compression, and AI. It possesses a strong patent portfolio—many of which are standards-essential—licensed to major companies such as Samsung, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Xiaomi. With a net margin of 48.1% and an operating cash flow margin of 24.6%, IDCC stands out as one of the most profitable entities in its sector. The ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce in favor of Samsung added $131 million in annual recurring revenue—a 67% increase over the previous agreement—plus a $119 million catch-up payment for Q2. This significantly reduces the risk of near-term revenue fluctuations and reinforces InterDigital’s intellectual property strength in mobile, video, and AI standards. While Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM)experienced an 8% decline during the same week, IDCC rose as investors anticipated future cash flows and improved visibility. The Q2 2025 results showcased the company’s momentum. Revenue skyrocketed 34% year-over-year to $300.6 million, significantly exceeding expectations. Non-GAAP EPS was reported at $6.52—almost double the estimates—while GAAP net income saw a 65% increase to $180.6 million. Smartphone licensing revenue rose 18% to $235 million, and licensing revenue from Consumer Electronics/Internet of Things/Automotive surged 175% to $65 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 79% year-over-year. With an upgraded full-year revenue forecast of $790–850 million, along with $41.7 million returned to shareholders in Q2, InterDigital is effectively leveraging its scale and influence. InterDigital has exhibited remarkable growth, with revenues increasing at an average rate of 22.9% over the past three years—significantly outpacing the S&P 500’s 5.3%. In the last 12 months alone, revenue jumped 33.5%, compared to just 4.4% for the broader market. InterDigital boasts a 57.3% operating margin (versus 18.3% for the S&P 500), a net margin of 48.1% (compared to 11.8%), and a 24.6% operating cash flow margin (versus 19.8%). These outstanding metrics arise from its lean, asset-light model, where upfront R&D results in high-margin, recurring licensing income. Financially, the company is on stable ground, with a 7.7% debt-to-equity ratio and 47.4% cash-to-assets, both significantly better than S&P 500 averages. With $948 million in cash and $472 million in debt, InterDigital is strategically positioned to invest, absorb shocks, or expand without financial pressure. Although InterDigital has historically underperformed the S&P 500 during significant market declines, it has consistently shown faster recovery. During the 2022 inflation crisis, the stock dropped 52.5% but fully recovered within a year. During the 2020 COVID market crash, it fell 46.9% and bounced back in under six months. Even during the Global Financial Crisis, when shares fell by 53.5%, InterDigital regained its footing in roughly 2.5 years. While the stock is certainly volatile, its track record suggests strong long-term resilience. IDCC meets numerous criteria: substantial upside through IP licensing, best-in-class margins, and improved visibility due to recurring revenue. Although it may not yet be a multi-billion-dollar entity, it presents asymmetric upside with defensible growth drivers. Not too pleased with the volatile nature of IDCC stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising a selection of 30 stocks, has a proven track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4 years. What’s the explanation? On average, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as evidenced in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

The Connected Economy 100 index had a tough week, losing 4.2% percent across all pillars except “eat.” While the index was down overall due to big drops at several companies, including double digits at Xero, iRobot, and United Healthcare, there were some notable highlights.

Δ LendingClub was up 21% for the week on strong earnings. The company’s second-quarter call painted a picture of borrowers who are borrowing more, paying better and sticking around. Personal-loan originations climbed 32% from a year earlier to $2.4 billion, helped by repeat customers who still account for roughly half of the volume. In comparison, the net charge-off ratio for loans held on the bank’s books fell to 3%, about half last year’s level. Strong credit trends let the company boost loan sales and net interest income, driving total revenue up 33% to $248 million and GAAP profit to $38 million. Deposit-gathering also accelerated: LevelUp Savings balances reached $2.7 billion, and the recently launched LevelUp Checking has spurred a six-fold jump in daily account openings, with close to 60% coming from existing borrowers — evidence that customers are deepening relationships rather than shopping elsewhere. Management cited “very high” marketplace demand for its paper, extending a Blue Owl funding pact and inking a first BlackRock transaction. As Chief Executive Scott Sanborn put it, “We’re not only consistently beating our competition, but we’re also beating our own expectations… our data is demonstrating the effectiveness of our underwriting and the resilience of our borrower base.” Cognex also posted strong earnings, leading to a 19% bounce. The maker of machine-vision cameras and AI software that helps factories and warehouses inspect products, track packages and guide robots said second-quarter revenue rose 4% to $249 million — its fourth straight quarter of organic growth — while disciplined spending lifted adjusted EBITDA margin to 20.7 %, the best showing in two years. Demand was broad-based: logistics booked a sixth consecutive period of double-digit gains, packaging sales grew mid-single digits on strength in healthcare and fast-moving consumer goods, and consumer-electronics orders stayed robust as device makers retooled overseas supply chains. Free cash flow reached $40 million, pushing 12-month conversion to 130 % of earnings, and management projected up to 9 % sales growth in the current quarter. “The momentum we saw in Q1 continued in Q2 with revenue of $249 million increasing 4 % year-on-year… our sales-force transformation is already generating good results and is an important component of this strategy,” Chief Executive Matthew Moschner told analysts. CyberArk rounded out the winners for the week. Its strong performance comes from the announcement that Palo Alto Networks, a heavyweight in AI-driven network, cloud and security-operations software, agreed to buy the company, which pioneered privileged-access and identity-security tools, in a cash-and-stock deal worth roughly $25 billion. CyberArk holders will receive $45 in cash and 2.2005 Palo Alto shares for each share they own — about a 26% premium to the stock’s 10-day average — and the news sent CyberArk shares sharply higher while positioning Palo Alto to add identity protection as a fourth pillar of its platform strategy. Management pitched the move as the right bet for an AI era that is spawning a boom in machine and agent identities: “Our market entry strategy has always been to enter categories at their inflection point, and we believe that moment for Identity Security is now,” Palo Alto Chief Executive Nikesh Arora said, calling CyberArk “the definitive leader” in the niche. CyberArk founder Udi Mokady framed the tie-up as an acceleration of his company’s two-decade mission, saying the combination “will bring unmatched expertise across human and machine identities, privileged access, and AI-driven innovation to secure what’s next.” Goldman’s Apple Card Partner Faces Uncertain Future US Workers See Wage Growth Slow With Lowest-Paid Hit Hardest Crypto Wobbles in August After New Tariffs Hit Apple AI Team Working on ChatGPT Rival We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

A federal judge in Texas largely denied a request by the world’s largest asset managers to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Republican state attorneys general claiming they colluded to reduce coal output, in a case that threatens how the U.S. firms oversee trillions of dollars. U.S. District Judge Jeremy Kernodle in Texas said most of the claims brought by the states can proceed, including allegations that BlackRock Inc., BlackRock Group Inc. and the asset management arm of State Street Corp. collectively used their stock to attempt to substantially lessen competition. Kernodle dismissed part of the lawsuit that was based on alleged violations of state law. In his Friday ruling, Kernodle said the states “have identified enough circumstantial evidence to suggest that defendants agreed to collectively pressure coal companies to reduce the output of coal in the relevant markets and disclose future output information.” Representatives for the firms didn’t immediately return requests for comment on the ruling. In their lawsuit, Texas and other Republican-led states claimed the asset managers colluded to pressure coal producers to reduce their production under the guise of pursuing environmental goals. The states cite the firms’ participation in carbon-reduction alliances as evidence of a “syndicate.” BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard hold major stakes in coal producers and profited when energy prices soared, according to the suit. More recently, the firms have pulled back from ESG in the U.S. and participation in groups such as Climate Action 100+ and Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. Texas even removed BlackRock from its blacklist of companies that boycott fossil fuels. But the lawsuit, filed in November, said that formal withdrawal from Climate 100+ “does not change the reality that defendants’ holdings threaten to substantially reduce competition in violation” of U.S. antitrust law. Lawyers for the three firms argued at a hearing in June that the firms did nothing to influence coal companies. “The antitrust claims in this case are unprecedented, they’re unsound and they’re unsupported,” said Gregg Costa, a lawyer representing BlackRock. “The claims just don’t add up.” Topics Lawsuits Texas Legislation

Title: How Jamie Dimon becomes Sam Altman’s biggest competitor

UPDATED 16:13 EDT / AUGUST 03 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and George Gilbert Last November, we argued that JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon is sitting on a treasure trove of unique data that will never find its way into proprietary large language models via the internet. And as such, he was OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s biggest competitor because his data is more valuable than the democratized insights from these LLMs. Our premise was and continues to be that foundation model companies are waging an internecine battle chasing artificial general intelligence (“Messiah AGI”) and the true holy grail is what we called “enterprise AGI” — meaning applying AI to proprietary data inside of enterprises will ultimately prove to be the most valuable economic endeavor. Today we extend that argument and posit that agents and enterprise digital twins, powered by that proprietary data, will drive the next wave of AI value. In our previous “Jamie Dimon” episode, we set a framework for the why. In this Breaking Analysis, we explain how enterprises such as JPMC will drive value in a way that frontier model vendors cannot. We’ll examine our original premise and share data that further reinforces the challenges foundation model vendors face, making it a daunting business. Moreover, we’ll explain why agents, programmed by data, will ultimately provide the biggest value unlock for enterprises in the coming years. We think of agent evolution in three distinct waves as shown below: Consumer agents – ChatGPT in its GPT-3/4 era gave us the first taste of a personal digital assistant. GPT-5 will likely deliver the first general-purpose, consumer-grade agent that can act on a user’s behalf, not just chat. Coding agents – Anthropic’s Claude paired with Cursor shows what happens when you post-train with reinforcement learning onto a strong base model and aim it at software engineering. Code is a good proving ground because outcomes are objectively testable, much like math problems. Enterprise agents – We believe this is the next frontier – i.e. agents powered by a live digital twin of the business. Not digital twins of something physical such as a factory like Nvidia Corp.’s Omniverse, rather an enterprise. Here the landscape changes. It’s not just about bigger models; it’s new vendor tech stacks, new vendor business models, and new customer operating models that we’ll explain. The value is so large that even Jamie Dimon, with his huge balance sheet and orders of magnitude more useful data than frontier labs have access to, is stepping onto Sam Altman’s playing field. With that framing in place, let’s walk through why the jump from consumer/coder agents to enterprise agents is not a linear extrapolation, and what new technology and organizational layers have to materialize before Jamie Dimon can realistically challenge OpenAI’s lead. We make the following additional points on this topic: Dimon, as we’ve talked about before, is a proxy for enterprises and the proprietary data and know-how that they have within their four walls that frontier LLMs cannot train on. This is why the real value will come from enterprises applying that data and know-how to extending the frontier LLMs or models that are similar to that and we’ll explain why. The real revolution is that we’ve moved from scaling laws in the pre-training era—which is the GPT models that ChatGPT and similar products were built on, to the post-training era, which is where we start using reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a fancy term for trial-and-error learning and, for trial-and-error, you have to be able to learn from your mistakes. So that’s where agents in the enterprise first take off. And then our contention is that to go beyond that is where we’re going to need a new type of technology platform — the enterprise digital twin. To get real value out of that, we’re going to have to go with a new—not just new technology model at the foundation where the data is — but a new operations model where firms have to organize around end-to-end outcomes like onboarding a new customer, not departmental or functional specialization. As such, we’re going to need lots of changes. And the main point is that Jamie Dimon (as a proxy for leading enterprises) and the value he’s going to extract from this era of AI is going to need completely different scaffolding and sets of business models for customers like him, as well as the vendors that supply him, compared to the era where ChatGPT is creating and capturing value today. In short, we believe this shift — from pre-training scale to post-training skill, and from siloed workflows to outcome-centric twins — sets the competitive chessboard for the next decade of enterprise AI. Let’s drill into the first wave a bit deeper ChatGPT on GPT3.5 got it all started. but GPT-5 is where we think ChatGPT’s real value as a general-purpose consumer agent begins. OpenAI’s own revenue projection (dotted red line below) climbs from low-single billions in 2024 to >$50 billion by 2027 — a growth curve that many people feel threatens Google Search – we’ll see. The red call-outs above are instructive as there are caveats, technical rewirings and business model changes that have to fall into place before GPT-5-class agents can move from cool demo to must-have personal assistant. Specifically: Thirty years ago investors hailed the commercial internet as the greatest legal creation of wealth in history. Today we hear equally grand pronouncements that generative AI surpasses fire, the wheel and electricity. GPT-5 will likely justify a good share of that hyperbole. By unifying multimodal reasoning — voice, video, tool use, research, code execution — OpenAI is poised to ship the first truly full-stack consumer agent, a blockbuster product by any historical yardstick. But the leap from headline to habit requires upheaval on multiple fronts: The headline is that GPT-5 can ignite massive consumer adoption, yet widespread value capture hinges on re-plumbing the web and re-monetizing content. That’s before we even tackle the additional hurdles unique to enterprise deployment, which carry their own technology, governance and operating-model demands. Before we get too excited about GPT-5, let’s stare at the brutal economics of scale. The data below tells a big story. Upper-right chart: That “scaling-law” line (log of compute petaflops for pretraining on the X-axis, log of test-loss, which is a fancy way of describing accuracy and the ability to recognize ever finer patterns, on the Y-axis) moves steadily down — but every inch of improvement demands an order-of-magnitude jump in PF-days (petaflop-days) of compute. Let’s unpack where the above numbers come from. On the slide above, the left axis shows estimated training cost per generation; the right axis plots the corresponding test-loss improvement. The $35 million mark for a GPT-3-class model is the common reference point. Each successive generation requires roughly a 10-times to to 30-times increase in training FLOPs, but after algorithmic and hardware efficiencies the all-in cash outlay still grows about five to 10 times each cycle. Numbers often look smaller because they capture only the final two- or three-month production run. That explains the confusion around DeepSeek’s reported $6 million cost; the figure omitted the research runs, data-ablation experiments and restarts that consume three to 10 times more compute before the last pass even begins. The slide’s curve makes a second point clear. Each jump in spend buys only an incremental drop in test loss — better predictive accuracy, more reliable answers, finer pattern detection. Keeping pace on pretraining alone is already pushing costs toward $10 billion for a single next-gen run. At that level the market cannot sustain many players unless they add a strongly differentiated layer on top of the base model. Coming bottlenecks in high-quality training data and intense competition will squeeze both the magnitude and the lifespan of any price premium on raw application programming interface access. Reinforcement-learning can address the law of diminishing returns by opening up a new scaling vector. And inference-time “reasoning” opens up yet another dimension of scaling. But the pretraining foundation still needs to keep advancing. This means the capital intensity of playing at the frontier model layer continues to increase exponentially. The economics of amortizing pretraining works as long as the end market continues to grow at a similar pace. But when the market growth slows, the cost of pretraining is going to look like a game of musical chairs when the music stops. So far we’ve focused on compute costs, but there’s an equally brutal constraint we need to discuss, which is that we’re running out of free, high-quality human text. The chart above tracks the “effective stock” of usable internet tokens (green band) versus the projected size of datasets consumed by frontier models (blue band). Those two curves meet around 2027-28 — meaning every extra point of model improvement will require new strategies. We should point out though that synthetic data is easy to generate with computer code because you can test it and therefore, the synthetic data now has more signal in it. Does it work? Does it not work? And you have all sorts of tests and that’s why as we’ll see, coding agents take off first. But the first way of trying to get past this data wall as we’re going to show is to use human-generated reasoning traces, which is when you get essentially a wide range of experts in different fields to try and elaborate on their problem-solving strategies to get to a solution for how to solve problems in specific domains, and that’s super expensive. As such: Model vendors will see their cost of goods sold for training data rise significantly. Depending on the posture of public policy, they may have to pay to license proprietary publisher data. Those deals are already starting as we saw with the recent Amazon/NYT deal. Whether this is the first of many or a high-water mark remains to be seen. More important, model vendors will have to source ever more sophisticated problem sets and “reasoning traces” from human experts in ever more fields. That’s what data vendors such as Scale.ai specialize in sourcing. Alex Wang of Scale AI says the next breakthroughs hinge on human-annotated chains of thought — not just more scraped text prose. Annotation at that depth is expensive and slow. It’s the next bottleneck. That type of data scarcity reshapes the economics of pretraining frontier models. And it’s why Meta reportedly shelled out ~$15 billion for a 50% stake in Scale.ai’s network of experts. [Listen to Alex Wang explain this phenomenon] A key point made by Wang is: “Data production will be the lifeblood of future AI systems” and he emphasized the human element – and this is why Meta paid $15 billion to acquire Alex. Some additional context to Alex Wang’s comments: Data production is very similar to spice production; it will be the lifeblood of future AI systems. The best-and-brightest people are one key source of that lifeblood, but proprietary data is just as critical. JPMorgan alone holds hundreds of petabytes of data, while GPT-4 trained on less than one petabyte. Enterprises and governments own orders of magnitude more proprietary data than has ever been fed into a frontier model, and that reservoir can power the next wave of truly elite systems. The open question is the role of synthetic data. The most plausible path is hybrid human-AI generation: AI handles the bulk creation, while domain experts — people with deep reasoning skills — inject high-fidelity corrections and insights. Hybrid human-AI data is the only way to achieve the extreme quality and nuance that future models will require. Meta’s reported $15 billion deal for Scale AI underscores this reality. The acquisition was less about tooling and more about access to Alex Wang, a small cadre of specialists, and Scale’s network of expert labelers across multiple domains. Human expert reasoning traces have emerged as the new bottleneck for frontier labs. In effect, these firms are calling for patriotic data contributions so everyone else can benefit, because without those human-validated traces, large language models will stall at their current ceiling. The funny part of Alex Wang’s comment was that he was basically calling on experts in every field to “contribute” their expertise for the benefit of mankind. Scale pays these experts for their time, but it’s still hourly wage labor. The tongue-in-cheek headline, “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,” was at the heart of Karl Marx’s economic philosophy. If you squint hard enough, that sounds an awful lot like what Alex Wang is proposing: Subject-matter experts contribute their knowledge for model training for the benefit of mankind. After the $15 billion acquihire, Alex Wang could be history’s richest communist. In the enterprise, there’s a very concrete use case that is already taking off and gives every indication of supporting frontier model training on its own. Why is coding is such a popular use case? And why are software engineering agents the first killer application in the enterprise? Let’s dig in. The face at the top on the graphic below is Anthropic PBC CEO Dario Amodei, whose Claude model powers Cursor the product — the software engineering agent. And Cursor is just the leading example of many software engineering agents. We’re still on the same intelligence-over-time curve, after the ChatGPT consumer bump, we see a new step-function labeled “Claude + Cursor SWE Agents.” The revenue table on the left — $1 million at launch, $100 million by month 12, $300 million by month 24, $500 million by month 30 — illustrates just how fast the uptake has been. What makes coding uniquely suited for early enterprise-agent success, and what hurdles remain before we can generalize this model to finance, supply-chain or customer-service domains where the feedback signals aren’t as clear? The answer is provided in the commentary below: Trial-and-error learning – reinforcement learning in formal terms – explains the breakout success of software-engineering agents. Unlike foundation models that consume 15 trillion tokens of data, a coding agent generates its own data. It proposes a solution, runs a test and immediately learns from pass-or-fail feedback. This loop supplies endless synthetic data and intrinsic reward signals, eliminating the need for vast proprietary datasets. Just as important, the workflow drops neatly into established developer tooling, so adoption requires no organizational surgery. These conditions made software engineering the natural beachhead for AI agents. Cursor is the iconic reference point, but dozens of similar tools are scaling fast, nearly all gravitating to Anthropic’s Claude frontier model as the preferred engine. Most products focus on writing net-new code or translating between languages; wholesale refactoring of legacy codebases is a harder problem and remains largely untapped. Success in software and math does not automatically port to other enterprise domains, where equivalent, high-fidelity feedback loops are harder to construct – a challenge we explore in subsequent slides. Let’s dig deeper into why SWE and math are such good examples. The chart below tracks accuracy on a basket of “intelligence” benchmarks – grade-school math, competitive math, software engineering task suite, multi-subject exams — over the past five years. Y-axis is benchmark accuracy; X-axis is calendar year. Everything meanders upward until sometime in 2024, then the red box shows a near-vertical surge. What changed? Post-training reinforcement learning on top of an already-strong base model. During the pretraining era – essentially up through mid-2024 – data efficiency was modest, reliant on scraping the vast but finite reservoirs of freely available Internet text. Once those wells began to run dry, progress hit diminishing returns. The inflection arrived in late 2024, when the post-training era took hold. Trial-and-error learning, i.e., reinforcement learning, allowed models to generate candidate outputs, verify them autonomously, and update weights based on right-or-wrong signals. Benchmarks in math and coding responded almost immediately, climbing at a near-vertical rate. The mechanism is straightforward: An agent checks its own work; if the test passes, the gradient reinforces that solution. If it fails, the model adjusts. That loop delivers dramatic gains without requiring trillions of new tokens. Both domains offer an immediate, unambiguous reward signal – code compiles or it doesn’t or it passes a unit test or it doesn’t; the math is either right or wrong – so the agent can as an objective verification tool, retry and learn. That tight loop means you don’t need another 10 trillion tokens of pretraining data; you just need a verifiable reward. But the catch is called out on the right of the graphic. The recipe doesn’t yet generalize to, say, legal reasoning or financial forecasting, where the ground truth is fuzzy, delayed or buried in human judgment. Generalizing the technique remains an open challenge. Two paths are emerging: The critical takeaway is once a domain provides an automated verifier, post-training efficiency explodes. The race is now to identify or construct verifiable environments beyond software and mathematics. There may be a new way of generating synthetic data that gets us past both the data bottleneck and the challenge of objectively verifiable rewards – something that appeared not long after Wang cashed his check. It has to do with trial-and-error learning (the fancy term is reinforcement learning) and models that can verify subjective, not objective, answers without humans in the loop. In other words, we may have a way of getting past human expert annotators detailing their reasoning to get to a correct answer. It appears GPT5, or an upgrade that comes soon after, will try to generate some combination of expert questions, answers, and the reasoning traces to get to the answers. Another model, acting like a teacher or verifier, will grade the right answers and the reasoning traces. This way the models might be able to get on a steep learning curve for more subjective answers just the way they’ve been learning math and coding. With verifiable rewards, SWE agents have been improving much faster than the general purpose underlying models. Once you inject reinforcement learning into a reliable reward signal, progress goes exponential. On the chart below, the Y-axis plots “task length” (think: wall-clock work a human would need). The gentle green slope (seven-month cadence) is overshadowed by the blue trend line on the right – halving the time horizon every 70 days. Left chart (METR data). Across general agent benchmarks the length of tasks an AI can complete without human hand-holding doubles roughly every seven months. GPT-2 could answer a trivia question; GPT-4o can spend ~15 minutes autonomously optimizing code for a custom chip. The slide isolates the core issue in agent self-improvement. For broad, loosely verified tasks the only boost comes from generic gains in the base model and occasional evaluation cycles – yielding a doubling of autonomous task-length roughly every seven months. In contrast, software-development agents operate with a hard reward signal: They either pass the unit test or they don’t. That verifiable feedback drives reinforcement learning that doubles task complexity every 70 days. The metric here is simple, how long the agent can run without human intervention. The sharper slope proves that hard, binary reward signals accelerate learning by an order of magnitude. That is the essential takeaway. Before crowning one model king, let’s look at the brutal economics of the models beneath the rise of agentic AI products. In the chart below, the Y-axis is the composite benchmark score; each colored step represents a new model release. The dark line highlights OpenAI’s leading model, which itself changes (with each square dot), and the quick catch-up by rivals (the other colored lines). The staircase chart plots an independent “AI-intelligence index” for frontier models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, DeepSeek, Alibaba, and others over the past 24 months. What stands out is how small both dimensions have become. GPT-4o takes the lead but within weeks DeepSeek R1 or Gemini 3 closes the gap. Switching costs between APIs are measured in a few lines of Python code, so the CAP shortens with every release. In other words, you can spend a billion dollars on compute and data only to enjoy a six-week pricing umbrella before the market reduces your advantage to zero. The point is, spending $10 billion and multiple years on a frontier training run no longer guarantees a lasting edge. The moment a new model lands, the competitive lead can evaporate almost as quickly as a new consumer gadget cycle. Unlike the pharmaceutical industry – where patent protection secures a decade of exclusivity – model training enjoys no comparable moat. The current race revolves around ever‐larger compute clusters and incremental algorithmic tweaks. Hardware scale is available to any firm with sufficient capital; algorithmic insights diffuse quickly through open research and employee mobility. Proprietary training data helps, but it is only one ingredient and rarely decisive. To achieve both a substantial competitive-advantage gap and a durable competitive-advantage period, the game must shift. The next era will require an entirely different data foundation, one capable of conferring a sustained, defensible edge. That foundation is the enterprise digital twin discussed in the sections that follow. To tease the last section, Jamie Dimon and any other enterprise that can model their data into a digital twin of operations, can train proprietary agents that have a very high CAG and a durable CAP. All the capex may be going into a half-dozen or more frontier labs, but the sustainable differentiation will lie in these enterprises. Let’s now explore how this dynamic shows up in pricing models for the underlying frontier models. The chart below lays this out. Here’s the killer behind those shrinking advantage windows: token prices are in free-fall. Y-axis is log-scale price per million tokens (from $100 down to sub-penny). X-axis spans October 2021 to April 2025. Each diagonal line shows successive model releases driving price down an order of magnitude every few months. So USD per million tokens against release dates. Every colored trend-line is a different capability tier -GPT-3.5-class (teal), GPT-4-class (pink), GPT-4o-plus (blue). Regardless of tier, prices are declining on an exponential glide-path: In other words, you can burn $10 billion on GPT-6 training and watch the market re-price that output at a fraction of the margin in a single quarter. Throw in minimal switching costs for customers of the API and you get the picture. The point is that packaged agents — bundled with proprietary data and workflow context — are where we think the durable economics will live. The accelerating collapse in API pricing stands apart from the economics of products built on top. Venture capital is pouring into frontier labs at an unprecedented rate. Nation-state funds are underwriting domestic model efforts, Chinese labs are proliferating and high-profile entrants – Elon Musk among them – are scrambling to join the race. The parallel to the late-’90s internet bubble is hard to ignore – tens of billions chasing what increasingly looks like a mirage. Today the consumer-agent crown already sits with the incumbent leader, and the leading API position belongs to Anthropic. Durable differentiation will not come from another round of capital-intensive model training; it will come from doing something genuinely different. That necessity ushers in the next era, where the advantage shifts to differentiated data foundations and domain-specific agent platforms. Let’s come back to our three eras of AI. We’ve come full circle: Consumer chatbots got us started, coding agents proved to be a flywheel, but enterprise agents are where the real money — and long-term moat — will be built in our view. Think of the trajectory in three discrete eras, mapped on the curve you’ve seen all episode: The core takeaway is AI is programmed by data, and true durable differentiation will come from proprietary data. Consider JPMorgan Chase as a stand-in for any advanced enterprise. Initial estimates pegged its private corpus at roughly 150 petabytes – already hundreds of times the half-petabyte to 1-petabyte used to train a GPT-4-class model. More recent figures suggest the bank may hold on the order of an exabyte. Yet volume alone isn’t the story; it’s how that data is modeled to represent day-to-day operations. Enterprise data is dense, high-signal and – if properly organized – far richer than the broad, low-signal crawl that feeds frontier models. Unlocking that value demands several shifts: These elements will trigger new go-to-market motions, a fresh generation of application-platform vendors, revamped technical stacks, and — ultimately — organizational and business-model change for the enterprises that adopt them. Let’s dig into what enterprise AGI will actually look like. Below is a classic diagram many use to describe the elements of agentic AI – but key pieces are missing to power the enterprise in our view. Most agent diagrams look identical – tools on the left – calendar, calculator, code interpreter, search; cognitive modules on the right – planning, reflection, self-critique, chain-of-thought, sub-goal decomposition; a memory stack across the top; and an action port along the bottom. The entire picture is algorithm-centric because that is what computer-science researchers reward. Data hardly shows up, yet in the enterprise data is everything. This particular diagram – borrowed from a recent Stanford Computer Science lecture – omits the component that actually creates value – the environment or world model. An agent learns only by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback on the outcome. In academic settings that omission is an afterthought; in a business context it is the difference between a toy and a system that can move revenue, cost, or risk. The absence of a first-class data layer in mainstream agent thinking underscores why enterprise agents remain an under-explored frontier. The disruption is staring the industry in the face, but few acknowledge it because the conversation is dominated by algorithmic heroes rather than data realism. Let’s pull some examples from real-world models where agents got started. Before we take too many liberties with the phrase enterprise digital twin, it helps to remember the very first twins that ever mattered to AI researchers were seen in gaming. DeepMind’s AlphaStar learned to dominate StarCraft II not just because its model architecture was magic , but because the entire game environment – the 4-D map of units, resources, timing and fog-of-war – was exposed as a perfect, real-time, real-world model. On the graph below we show the match-making-rating or MMR percentile on the X-axis, skill level on the Y-axis. The blue curve is human progression from silver to grandmaster; the red dot is AlphaStar smashing through the top percentile – discovering strategies no human had ever tried, courtesy of reinforcement learning a digital twin. The crucial insight is the mapping of people, places, things and activities inside a game world to the same four dimensions — people, places, things and processes—inside a business. Conventional data platforms provide static snapshots, a kaleidoscope view. Agents require a richer, dynamic representation that captures how actions ripple across the enterprise. When an agent modifies a step in a process it needs the map to trace the impact on downstream people and workflows. Reinforcement learning flourished first inside environments that already contained such world models. DeepMind’s AlphaStar for StarCraft and OpenAI’s work on the Dota strategy game are canonical examples. Each environment supplied continuous, verifiable rewards – intermediate signals that tested strategic choices and an ultimate win-or-lose outcome. These conditions allowed agents to iterate rapidly and improve. The same principles apply to the enterprise. By constructing a four-dimensional digital twin – people, places, things, processes – businesses can deliver the feedback loops agents need to learn, adapt and ultimately drive measurable results across complex operations. Lessons from AlphaStar and Dota form the blueprint for this more advanced, enterprise-grade implementation. If an agent can exploit a synthetic world model to beat 99% of pro gamers, imagine what it can do when the “map” is a digital twin of a bank or a live model of a supply-chain. But that also means enterprises – not vendors – must own and curate the world model so the agent can learn with verifiable rewards. The point is that the lessons from AlphaStar will translate to finance, healthcare and manufacturing, anything with a digital twin. Minecraft serves as the next reference world model. In the Voyager project the environment is more open-ended than StarCraft. An agent starts by learning how to craft simple stone tools, then uses those tools to build basic structures. As competence grows it discovers how to forge more advanced implements, each new capability unlocking a broader range of tasks. Over time the agent accumulates skills and expands the set of tools at its disposal. That progressive, self-directed skill acquisition is critical because every new ability enriches the environment and, in turn, furnishes richer feedback for further learning. The pattern – learn a tool, use it to create value, learn the next tool – provides an important template for constructing an enterprise world model where agents continuously extend their own action space. Now let’s really try to double down on the importance of data. Every headline about AI credits the algorithm – AlexNet, Transformers, RLHF, the new reasoning stacks – but the right side of this slide reminds us that each breakthrough was really sparked by a new dataset era. A recent blog post by Jack Morrison, highlighted on the Latent Space podcast, underscores a recurring blind spot: Everyone fixates on algorithmic breakthroughs while ignoring the dataset hiding in plain sight. Morrison sketches the reasoning era and notes that agents will learn from verifiers — calculators for math, compilers and unit tests for code — yet leaves the critical dataset box essentially blank. The dataset is obvious. Every organization is building, or will build, a platform that captures an ever-larger digital twin of its operations. That twin — people, places, things, processes — is the immense, high-fidelity corpus that will power enterprise-grade reasoning. Let’s now connect enterprise agents with digital twins as we’re defining them. We’ve moved up the curve from consumer chat to coding / SWE agents – and the slide below shows how it all works inside a company. The chart from Palantir highlights at the bottom right an end-to end supply-chain twin; red call-outs on the left highlight RL feedback arrows feeding the agent box. The metric tree illustrates how “What happened?” rolls up to “What should we do?” Think of three layers working in concert: Installing a digital twin – like the Palantir schematic shown here – is only the first step. The engine that turns that representation into agent learning is the metric tree. Unlike conventional business intelligence dashboards, where key performance indicators live in isolated tables or hand-coded formulas, a metric tree links every measure in a learned, hierarchical graph. Change a node – say, authorizing a product return – and the tree reveals ripples across customer-support satisfaction, on-hand inventory and cash-flow metrics. The richer the twin, the higher the fidelity of those relationships. The agent sits above this structure and dynamically selects tools that correspond to analytical intent: If the tree lacks a metric, the agent adds one – mirroring how Voyager in “Minecraft” learned new tools and skills, then fed them back into the environment. Each new metric becomes a tool; each successful action becomes a skill; both flow into the twin, iteratively expanding its scope. The result is a self-reinforcing feedback loop: Agent actions enrich the symbolic model, and the enriched model, in turn, sharpens agent decisions. The twin need not be perfect on day one; it grows in lock-step with agent capability. Let’s look at how this will affect enterprise architecture. This graphic below builds on our previous work and pulls it all together. It also answers the question: Who is actually building a live, digital representation of the business? The graphic reprises the layered stack often used in Breaking Analysis and Services-as-Software. This pattern echoes the history of information technology: Each new abstraction layer envelops the one below. Lower layers keep innovating, but lose feature-based differentiation and pricing power once the upper layer decides which capabilities to expose. Traditional data platforms captured snapshots of strings; metric-centric platforms upgraded those to snapshots of things. The green layer goes further – capturing processes – bridging sixty years of application and data islands. A quick tour of the contenders: Margin and control will accrue to the layer that captures processes and feeds agents; data infrastructure, while indispensable, becomes the cost-optimized foundation beneath it. Let’s focus now on how enterprise software is splitting into two worlds. Picture the frozen-lake scene from the recent Bond film: Rami Malek’s villain stands unharmed on the glossy surface while a diver flails in the frigid water below. The metaphor captures how enterprise software is cleaving into two distinct worlds. The industry is aligning accordingly: players above the ice focus on modeled business context and higher-margin economics, while those below face mounting pressure to commoditize. The strategic choice is to move up into outcome-driven layers or prepare for tightening margins in the infrastructure trench. The discussion comes back to a single conclusion: Ownership of coherent, high-signal enterprise data is the deciding factor in the next wave of AI value capture. Labs may still dominate headline model releases, yet those models increasingly rely on proprietary ground-truth data that only large organizations possess in scale. On the visual above, Sam Altman anchors the left – world-famous foundation models. Amodei sits center-left, demonstrating that post-training on domain feedback can spin meaningful ARR. Center-right stands the prize everyone is pursuing. In our view, a live, verifiable digital twin of an enterprise is represented at the far right by Dimon, steward of the deepest transaction ledger in banking, perfectly positioned to weaponize that twin and challenge model labs on both margin and moat.

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts, Scale TL;DR: Figma’s $1.2 billion IPO at a $19.3 billion valuation that soared to $47.1 billion on day one represents one of the most successful tech IPOs in years, outperforming most major offerings since 2020 in terms of both fundamentals and market reception. Figma stands out even among recent high-growth software IPOs like Circle and CoreWeave, with year-over-year revenue growth approaching 50% and Q1 profitability. While 2020’s mega IPOs raised more capital in absolute terms, Figma’s combination of scale, profitability, and explosive first-day performance makes it the gold standard for how B2B companies should approach public markets in 2025. The Fundamentals: – $749 million revenue in 2024 (48% YoY growth), $1B ARR today – 91% gross margin with rolling 12-month revenue of $821 million – Q1 2025 net income of $44.9 million – profitability at scale – Over 13 million monthly users, with only one-third being designers – Around 450,000 customers as of March 31 The IPO Performance: – Priced at $33 per share (above initial $25-$28 range) – Opened at $85, hit intraday high of $124.63, closed first day at $115.50 – 250% first-day pop from offer price – Market cap jumped from $19.3 billion to $47.1 billion Snowflake (September 2020): – Raised $3.9 billion, largest software IPO ever at the time – Valued at $33 billion pre-trading, more than doubled on first day – Narrowly outperformed Nasdaq since initial pop Airbnb (December 2020): – Raised $3.4 billion at $47.3 billion valuation – 112% first-day jump – Up less than 3% since first day as of reporting DoorDash (December 2020): – Priced at $102, first trade at $182, 85% first-day gain – Investors who bought after initial pop lost money The Key Difference: All four 2020 mega IPOs (including Uber/Lyft from 2019) relied on vast amounts of outside capital to grow networks and only Airbnb recorded net profit in latest quarter after massive cost cuts. Figma achieved profitability while growing 48% YoY – a fundamentally different trajectory. CoreWeave (March 2025): – Priced below expectations at $40 per share ($20 billion valuation) – Up 270% since IPO – $981.6 million revenue (420% growth) but $314.6 million net loss – 77% of revenue from just two customers, Microsoft accounting for 62% Circle (June 2025): – Stock shot up 500% after debut – Raised $1.05 billion 1. True SaaS Economics at Scale Unlike the capital-intensive, low-margin businesses of 2020’s sharing economy giants, Figma demonstrates classic SaaS metrics that VCs dream about: – 91% gross margins (compared to traditional cloud infrastructure plays) – Subscription-based recurring revenue model – Expanding user base beyond core design market 2. Profitability Without Sacrificing Growth Figma generated net income in Q1 2025 while maintaining 46% YoY growth – something that eluded most 2020 IPO darlings. This proves the SaaS model’s inherent scalability when executed correctly. 3. Market Timing and Positioning Figma could serve as a bellwether for the market, providing proof-of-concept for other SaaS names like Canva, Netskope, and Databricks. The company went public at the perfect inflection point of IPO market recovery. 4. Platform Expansion Strategy Only one-third of Figma’s 13 million monthly users are designers, demonstrating successful expansion beyond initial TAM – a key growth vector that wasn’t present in most 2020 IPOs. 2021 saw a record 1,035 IPOs, with 155 U.S. venture-backed IPOs raising $60.4 billion. Three of the 10 biggest tech IPOs ever happened in 2020, with companies commanding valuations “seemingly untethered from any analytic metrics”. The IPO market essentially froze after 2021, with only 13 such offerings in 2022, 18 in 2023, and 30 in 2024, collectively raising just $13.3 billion. 201 IPOs so far in 2025, with IPO issuance estimated to range from 155 to 195 deals. June 2025 produced five tech IPOs, accelerating from a monthly average of two since January. Based on Figma’s template, the next wave of successful tech IPOs will likely include: – Canva ($32 billion valuation, $2.6 billion revenue, seven consecutive years of profitability) – Databricks (60% revenue growth, 140%+ net revenue retention) – Klarna ($2.8 billion revenue, returning to profitability) After Figma’s Massive IPO, Could Canva IPO at $200 Billion+? Figma’s IPO success isn’t just about market timing – it’s about building an incredibly sound SaaS business that grows efficiently, expands its market, and generates sustainable profits. In a market that’s both infatuated with AI but also becoming increasingly discerning at scale after the 2020-2021 excesses, Figma proves that great SaaS companies can still command premium valuations and deliver explosive public market debuts. SaaS isn’t dead. In fact, it’s bigger than ever. With its best IPO to date, so far. For founders building the next generation of SaaS companies, Figma’s path from design tool to connected platform to profitable public company offers the clearest roadmap to IPO success in today’s market environment. The bottom line: Figma didn’t just go public – it set the new standard for how exceptional SaaS companies should approach public markets in 2025 and beyond.

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The Nasdaq has been rallying nonstop since April. Let’s discuss three covered call fund payouts up to 11.2% that play the rally. The catalyst is the “rise of the machines” with companies replacing expensive humans with cheaper robots and AI tools. Hiring numbers are down and (paradoxically to some) the Nasdaq continues to levitate higher. This summer heater in tech stocks is no surprise to us contrarians. The Naz tech giants are enjoying expanding profit margins! Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy recently admitted the company’s workforce will shrink, replaced by AI. This is bad for those who work at Amazon, but great for those who own AMZN. Microsoft (MSFT) also announced big layoffs in recent months, especially in sales and support roles easily handled by AI-driven tools. And my friends at Alphabet (GOOG) are looking over their shoulders wondering how much longer their services will be needed. This is a dicey time to be a rank-and-file tech bro—but an exciting time to be a tech savvy dividend investor. Here are three “one-click” (or one-tap) dividend plays on this megatrend! Alphabet (GOOG) will never pay 11.2%. But we can buy GOOG and the rest of Big Tech for 11.2% payouts via a fund like Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD), which sells (“writes”) covered call funds on the Naz index itself to generate additional income. QYLD buys the stocks in the Nasdaq-100 and simultaneously writes covered calls on the index itself to generate income—which it pays out monthly. It’s not perfect exposure to technology. The Nasdaq-100 is made up of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange, and in fact, it includes stocks from 10 different sectors. However, it’s still tech-heavy, at 60% of the index’s weight, and includes trillion-dollar tech firms like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), so it’s generally treated as a proxy for the sector. But that’s a marginal consideration. The real tradeoff to weigh is tactical. By selling covered calls against the Nasdaq, we’re sacrificing potential upside in return for a.) much more stability and b.) the very high income from the options premiums it collects. QYLD will rarely outperform the “QQQs” to the upside. But it also has less downside exposure, thanks to the constant income it generates by selling the call options. The JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income (JEPQ) uses a similar strategy, owning roughly 100 or so Nasdaq stocks while selling calls against the Nasdaq-100. It also doles out its massive dividend in monthly distributions. But it’s a little more flexible because of a big difference between it and QYLD: management. Whereas QYLD tracks an index and typically has only one options position at any given moment, JEPQ is led by 38-year veteran Hamilton Reiner and a team of four co-managers who can sell multiple contracts. I’ve also pointed out in the past that while both funds hold pretty much the same stocks, JEPQ is more heavily weighted in mega-cap names than QYLD. But that’s not by definition. Indeed, today, JEPQ has a smaller percentage of assets invested in each of its top 10 holdings than QYLD. These might not seem like meaningful differences, but over time we see that JPMorgan’s “homemade” strategy beat QYLD’s straightforward approach. Active management can make a world of difference—so much so that I typically prefer closed-end funds (CEFs) over comparable ETFs. Let’s walk over to the CEF side of the border to review our final call writer. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) is a CEF, while QYLD and JEPQ are ETFs. But the differences go far beyond fund type. Paul Wick, who has nearly four decades of experience, and a team of five other managers run a slimmer portfolio of about 55 holdings. The portfolio is also a purer—though not pure—play on technology, with about 70% of assets dedicated to the sector. STK also is interested in “growth at a reasonable price” (GARP); a relatively more value-priced portfolio shows it, with price-to-earnings, sales, book, and cash flow all lower than the other ETFs. And whereas QYLD tries to own Nasdaq-100 stocks (and while JEPQ has a broader mandate but looks index-esque in its larger holdings), STK is much more willing to take some shots—stocks such as Lam Research (LRCX) and industrial Bloom Energy (BE) punch well above their weight. Columbia Seligman’s CEF writes covered calls, too—typically on the Nasdaq-100, but again, it has more flexibility. For instance, right now, management is selling Apple calls, too. The strategy works. In fact, it works mighty well. STK still has its drawbacks. Unlike other covered-call funds, Columbia Seligman’s fund is actually more volatile than the Nasdaq, not less. Moreover, while the ETFs pay monthly, this CEF is only paying us on a quarterly schedule—and at current prices (which admittedly represent a slight discount to net asset value), it’s paying us just half as much as JEPQ and QYLD.

However, it’s still tech-heavy, at 60% of the index’s weight, and includes trillion-dollar tech firms like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), so it’s generally treated as a proxy for the sector. But that’s a marginal consideration. The real tradeoff to weigh is tactical. By selling covered calls against the Nasdaq, we’re sacrificing potential upside in return for a.) much more stability and b.) the very high income from the options premiums it collects. QYLD will rarely outperform the “QQQs” to the upside. But it also has less downside exposure, thanks to the constant income it generates by selling the call options. The JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income (JEPQ) uses a similar strategy, owning roughly 100 or so Nasdaq stocks while selling calls against the Nasdaq-100. It also doles out its massive dividend in monthly distributions. But it’s a little more flexible because of a big difference between it and QYLD: management. Whereas QYLD tracks an index and typically has only one options position at any given moment, JEPQ is led by 38-year veteran Hamilton Reiner and a team of four co-managers who can sell multiple contracts. I’ve also pointed out in the past that while both funds hold pretty much the same stocks, JEPQ is more heavily weighted in mega-cap names than QYLD. But that’s not by definition. Indeed, today, JEPQ has a smaller percentage of assets invested in each of its top 10 holdings than QYLD. These might not seem like meaningful differences, but over time we see that JPMorgan’s “homemade” strategy beat QYLD’s straightforward approach. Active management can make a world of difference—so much so that I typically prefer closed-end funds (CEFs) over comparable ETFs. Let’s walk over to the CEF side of the border to review our final call writer. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) is a CEF, while QYLD and JEPQ are ETFs. But the differences go far beyond fund type. Paul Wick, who has nearly four decades of experience, and a team of five other managers run a slimmer portfolio of about 55 holdings. The portfolio is also a purer—though not pure—play on technology, with about 70% of assets dedicated to the sector. STK also is interested in “growth at a reasonable price” (GARP); a relatively more value-priced portfolio shows it, with price-to-earnings, sales, book, and cash flow all lower than the other ETFs. And whereas QYLD tries to own Nasdaq-100 stocks (and while JEPQ has a broader mandate but looks index-esque in its larger holdings), STK is much more willing to take some shots—stocks such as Lam Research (LRCX) and industrial Bloom Energy (BE) punch well above their weight. Columbia Seligman’s CEF writes covered calls, too—typically on the Nasdaq-100, but again, it has more flexibility. For instance, right now, management is selling Apple calls, too. The strategy works. In fact, it works mighty well. STK still has its drawbacks. Unlike other covered-call funds, Columbia Seligman’s fund is actually more volatile than the Nasdaq, not less. Moreover, while the ETFs pay monthly, this CEF is only paying us on a quarterly schedule—and at current prices (which admittedly represent a slight discount to net asset value), it’s paying us just half as much as JEPQ and QYLD.

Title: Big Tech has cut over 100,000 jobs this year — and the AI revolution is just getting started

Since the start of the year, Big Tech has shed over 100,000 jobs. Sure, some of these layoffs are just standard corporate belt tightening, but it is now clear that AI is impacting the job market — and entry- and mid-level workers are being hit the hardest. This underscores a defining question of our time: Will AI lead to widespread unemployment, or will it create new opportunities and industries that we can’t yet imagine? So far, AI is displacing jobs faster than new ones are being created. The displacement of workers through automation is nothing new. Emerging technologies upend legacy companies and industries, and usher in new organizations with better jobs with higher pay. It’s a cycle that’s been dubbed “creative destruction” by economist Joseph Schumpeter. Throughout history, that has meant short-term pain for long-term gain — at least for some. On the one hand, the automobile put farriers and stage-coach drivers out of business but created millions of good-paying jobs for automotive assembly workers and truck drivers. On the other, the internet replaced many department-store clerks, travel agents, taxi drivers and journalists with Amazon fulfillment center workers, Uber drivers, content creators and others who often work more hours for less pay with fewer benefits. And in the Rust Belt and factory towns, automation has eliminated countless workers with no obvious replacement in sight. The disruption from AI could make this look like kids’ stuff. Historically, technology has automated workers at the periphery — those with low skills that can easily be substituted. AI will automate everything, everywhere, all at once, displacing knowledge workers and managers in every industry. Ironically, tradespeople like welders, electricians, plumbers and carpenters who were told “learn to code” may be the last to get automated away. Already, engineers at Amazon are complaining that their role has been degraded as they’re asked to do more with AI. There is an added concern that AI will kill many careers before they begin. In a recent interview with Axios, Dario Amodei, CEO of AI darling Anthropic, said AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs — and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years. A LinkedIn executive echoed this sentiment in a recent New York Times essay with the alarming title “The bottom rung of the career ladder is breaking,” citing at-risk entry-level jobs such as paralegals and call center operators. Tech CEOs seem unfussed by the potential of a looming cataclysm — if anything, they’re doing what they can to usher it in. Mark Zuckerberg told Joe Rogan this year that AI will replace most of Meta’s mid-level engineers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said last year that AI already writes 30% of the company’s code. In the last few months, Microsoft has fired more than 15,000 people. Shareholders are rewarding executives that adopt AI and slash headcount: Microsoft’s stock just hit an all time high. Not all tech workers are suffering. In fact, a few super-engineers are reaping unprecedented windfalls from the AI revolution, commanding pay packages of hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and stock that would make hedge-fund managers or superstar athletes blush. Not all tech workers are suffering. In fact, a few super-engineers are reaping unprecedented windfalls from the AI revolution, commanding pay packages of hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and stock that would make hedge-fund managers or superstar athletes blush. As he’s musing about mass cuts to his workforce to Rogan, Zuckerberg is also poaching the top AI minds from competitors like OpenAI and Apple with eye-popping pay packages. Ruoming Pang was lured away from Apple with an offer worth $200 million — triple what Apple CEO Tim Cook made last year. Is AI exposing yet another fault line between haves and have-nots? Is this a harbinger of what we can come to expect from an AI economy? So far AI has created huge wealth for founders, investors and the top 0.01% of tech talent. But what about the rest of us? This goes beyond business with implications for governments and society. President Trump initially rose to popularity by tapping into the anger and fears of an aging blue-collar work force who felt left behind by globalization and automation. He sustained his appeal by broadening his coalition to include a more diverse and younger part of the electorate, namely Gen Z men, who are among the most at-risk groups when it comes to being replaced by AI. An economy where young people can’t find work could deepen Gen Z’s economic pessimism into existential nihilism. New technologies are always greeted with a mixture of hope, trepidation and outright pessimism. Ultimately, technology has no agency. It is not morally good or bad. It is a tool, created and wielded by people. Human beings learned to make fire, and cook food, stay warm and clear land for agriculture — or burn down a rival’s hut.

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Amazon's stock dropped 8.3% as AWS's growth significantly lagged rivals like Azure and Google Cloud, disappointing investors despite strong retail sales.AWS's slower growth stems from its lack of integrated proprietary AI models and a strategy requiring high technical expertise, hindering adoption in the generative AI age.Analysts express skepticism regarding Amazon's ability to compete effectively in AI, citing CEO Jassy's unconvincing explanations and AWS's strategic shortcomings. Amazon stock fell 8.3% in after-hours trading on Thursday following a mixed second quarter report, according to CNBC. Why? Although Amazon’s retail business performed well, investors expressed disappointment with the growth pace of Amazon Web Services – which grew more slowly than Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Analysts were left wanting more from CEO Andy Jassy’s explanations during the conference call for AWS’s relatively slow growth. Amazon’s fundamental problem is its failure to adapt to the competitive imperatives of the generative AI age, noted my book Brain Rush. This age has been propelled by two companies – OpenAI which supplied the fast-growing ChatGPT and Nvidia, the designer of AI chips for speeding the training and operation of AI chatbots. Amazon seems to be applying the strategy it used to pioneer the cloud services industry to the AI cloud market – where it is struggling to catch up. More specifically, unlike Microsoft and Google – which have access to proprietary integrated AI chatbots (ChatGPT and Gemini, respectively) – AWS’s strategy of handing off to developers the task of choosing and integrating individual computing services requires more technical expertise – thereby slowing adoption. To grow faster, Jassey ought to consider three possible strategies: Since Jassy helped build AWS and has yet to demonstrate a compelling vision for competing with faster growing rivals, I am skeptical of whether Amazon will be able to leapfrog these rivals. “Our conviction that AI will change every customer experience is starting to play out," Jassy said in an earnings release. “Our AI progress across the board continues to improve our customer experiences, speed of innovation, operational efficiency, and business growth, and I’m excited for what lies ahead,” he added. I have requested comment from Amazon and will update this post if I receive a response. Amazon’s second quarter results blended above expectations sales and earnings with a mixed forecast for the future and a shaky explanation for why AWS is growing more slowly in the age of AI. Here are the key numbers: Amazon and its hyperscaler rivals – such as Google and Meta – are increasing their capital expenditures. For example, Amazon is boosting capital expenditures 42% to $118 billion in 2025, Google’s will reach $85 billion and Meta forecast $69 billion in 2025 capex, according to CNBC. Investors are using growth rates as a proxy for the return on AI investments. Since AWS is growing at roughly half the rate of Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, investors see a problem with AWS’s strategy. Jassy’s responses to analyst questions about AWS’ relatively slow growth did not directly address the question. He said the faster-growing second ranked rival was “65%” the size of AWS, highlighted Microsoft’s security woes – notably the hacking of SharePoint, and suggested it was “early days” in AI, according to the Q2 earnings conference call transcript. These comments did not offer a compelling explanation of why Amazon – with 30% market share to Microsoft Azure’s 20%, according to Synergy Group -- is growing about half the rate of challengers. Since Jassy sidestepped the question, here are two reasons I think AWS is growing more slowly than rivals: Here are three strategies Amazon must pursue to grow faster than its cloud services rivals: These recommendations may be difficult to implement and may not result in new services that deliver more value to customers than those from faster-growing rivals. That’s partly because they are at odds with Amazon’s culture. For example, Amazon believes in inventing and improving its own solutions – as it did with AWS and Alexa. Therefore the recommended partnerships may be at odds with the company’s culture. Moreover, as former CEO of AWS, Jassy may have strategic blind spots. These could include viewing AI as primarily an infrastructure challenge that Amazon can solve with superior engineering. Jassy may also be dismissing the more rapid growth of rivals as superficial, as he did during the investor conference call, rather than a sign customers value AI cloud services from Microsoft and Google more highly. Is Amazon stock – which has lost 2.4% of its value so far in 2025 – trading at a bargain price? Some analysts sound skeptical: Despite this skepticism, analysts see Amazon stock as slightly undervalued. Of the 52 analysts who cover Amazon, the stock has 9.2% upside based on an average price target of $255.72, according to Zacks. Unless AWS’ revenue growth and operating profit accelerate, that modest gain could prove difficult to achieve.

Title: Second Quarter Earnings: Magnificent 7 Outperform Growth Expectations
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/08/03/second-quarter-earnings-magnificent-7-outperform-growth-expectations/
Time Published: 2025-08-03T11:00:00Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. This week is the second busiest of the second-quarter earnings season, with 124 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Pfizer (PFE), Yum! Brands (YUM), McDonald’s (MCD), Caterpillar (CVX), and Walt Disney (DIS). The Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) released better-than-expected earnings on Saturday. Warren Buffett continues to be a net seller of stocks. All the details about Berkshire’s quarterly earnings are here. According to FactSet, 82% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings above consensus estimates, with 66% of companies having already reported results. Companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 10.3% year-over-year, above the 4.9% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 9.9%, and for 2026, the expectation is 13.8%. Despite the better earnings results, the S&P 500 retreated from all-time highs last week, with jobs, increased tariffs, and escalating tension with Russia weighing on the index. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed primarily due to blowout earnings from Microsoft and Meta Platforms. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) reported robust earnings growth, which also continued to reinforce the artificial intelligence earnings narrative. Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) also beat consensus estimates by a healthy margin with their earnings reports, but both stocks traded lower last week on concerns about the outlook. NVIDIA (NVDA) is the last of the Magnificent 7 to report results, scheduled for August 27. Positive earnings surprises from the technology, consumer discretionary, and communication services sectors were the most significant contributors to the improved earnings picture last week. Better-than-expected earnings from Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META) were the most essential contributors, according to FactSet. Following better-than-expected data last week, sales growth of 5.0% is ahead of the 4.2% year-over-year expectation at the end of the quarter. Better sales results in the healthcare, consumer discretionary, and technology sectors were the most significant drivers of the improvement in expected revenue growth last week, according to FactSet. While the first-quarter headline GDP understated the underlying trend of the US economy, the second-quarter headline GDP number overstates the economy’s strength due to fluctuations in trade related to tariffs. Due to the trade distortion, final sales to private domestic purchasers are a better measure to watch, and they slowed to a 1.2% pace after the 1.9% growth in the first quarter. This measure excludes the impacts of trade, inventories, and government spending, so it does a better job of measuring the activity of the US private sector. Monthly nonfarm payrolls grew by a below-consensus 73,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%. There was a shockingly significant downward revision in payroll jobs over the previous months, chopping off 258,000 jobs from what was previously reported. Downward revisions, especially of this magnitude, are a sign that the labor market is cooling. Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The deterioration in the three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence that the labor market is softening. While one should not jump to conclusions after one ugly month, it should be monitored closely for a continuation of the downtrend. The weekly continuing claims for unemployment benefits have deteriorated slightly, indicating that the unemployed are having a harder time finding another job. Still, it has been a slow leak rather than a collapse so far. It is the second busiest week of earnings season, before earnings reports slow markedly next week. The shockingly soft monthly jobs report on Friday sent the odds of a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) soaring. Markets are currently pricing in an 87% chance of a 25-basis-point cut at the September meeting. There aren’t any top-tier economic releases next week, but Fedspeak will be monitored closely for any reaction to the monthly payroll report. Last week, President Trump announced new reciprocal tariff rates for countries not yet reaching a trade deal with the US. Generally, these new tariff rates become effective on August 7. News about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will remain a focus. More sectoral tariffs could also be forthcoming. After hitting an all-time high last Monday, stocks retreated in the wake of a shockingly poor jobs report, increased tariffs, and escalating geopolitical tension with Russia. Stocks had been boosted by the twin forces of better-than-expected earnings and a receding threat of recession. While the earnings story continues, particularly in the AI-related technology space, an increase in the odds of recession weighed on risk appetite.

She knows too much and can name far too many powerful names. This whole performance right now is her showing that so long as she gets a pardon, she can be counted on to protect them. Any congressional testimony that she would give would be well rehearsed and by bipartisan agreement, there would be no real questions asked of her that had not been agreed upon. I don’t think that Trump will give her a pardon anytime soon as that would blow up support from most of his base but he could do so as he leaves the Presidency when any odium would all be on him but who could care less. Supposedly they moved her to a minimum security prison in Texas. More comfortable, better food, full dental. Gee, I wonder what the consideration was for that? It’s also the current home of fraudster Elizabeth Holmes. I would think that the kind of upper-middle class perps there would shun the likes of Maxwell. She should be careful of what she wishes for. For Ghislaine, there is a barrister showing photographs Of every head she’s had the pleasure to know And all the young girls that come and go Stop and say hello On the corner is nobility with a motorcar And everybody laughs at Andy behind his back And the billionaire never wears a rubber in the pouring rain Very strange Ghislaine is in my ears and in my eyes Vet beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back in Ghislaine, there is a minimum security prison in Texas And in her pocket is a pardon from his esteemed She likes to keep her record clean It’s a clean machine Ghislaine, is in my ears and in my eyes A tour d’farce and insidious lies In summer, meanwhile back Behind the shelter in the middle of a cell block A jailbird is about to go astray And though she feels as if she’s in a play She is anyway Ghislaine is in my ears and in my eyes Vet beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back Ghislaine is in my ears and in my eyes Vet beneath the blue suburban skies Ghislaine Penny Lane, by the Beatles https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7syIxQCquo&list=RDz7syIxQCquo I know this is cynical, but the women’s life expectancy has to be pretty short, whether she’s in prison or not. I think its a simple a matter of “the women who knows too much”. The fact that she is still alive suggests everyone assumes she has some kind of dead-man switch for release of incriminating information. Always wondered why Epstein didn’t. Though if he were actually still alive somewhere… Just speculating Her daddy didn’t. Arrogance? Yes but he got a prime burial plot on the Mount of Olives. Maybe that was his final deal as he jumped off his luxury yacht instead of being pushed by a mossad agent. I doubt that Maxwell has all that much in the way of salacious information to bargain with, but it should be enough to get housed (against all FBP rules) in a minimum security “camp” until her sentence is commuted for “good behavior.” The pardon won’t come until Trump’s headed out the door. Maxwell and Epstein were pimps, not pedophiles (a sexual interest in pre-pubescent children). They pandered to the tastes of wealthy, powerful, and often married, men for youthful “models” to cavort with in the present and to breed with after the collapse (the really creepy part). It was easy to groom these “models” for the sex trade when they were 15-17 years of age — one of the oldest stories in the book. Like any good pimp Epstein got first dibs. Offensively exploitative but hardly shocking. Listening to Michael Wolff, the real dirt is that Epstein and Maxwell have evidence that Trump was laundering money for Russian oligarchs off-shoring their cash when the Putin government started clawing back their ill-gotten gains from the ‘90’s. Epstein told Wolff that Trump ratted him out to the FBI in 2008 in retaliation for Epstein’s threats to expose the financial shell-game behind the sale of the Maison de l’Amité in Palm Beach to art-collector and AC Monaco football-owner Dmitry Rybolovlev, after Trump froze him out of the deal. Epstein told Wolff that he was convinced (and probably had the dirt) that Trump had conspired with Rybolovlev to falsely inflate the value of the property through secret loans and a sham re-sale, evading money laundering rules and capital gains taxes — a pretty serious crime. I don’t see how you can assert that Epstein and Maxwell were not pedophiles and minimize their sex trafficking. The Federal law that criminalizes traveling abroad for the sole purpose of having sex puts the age of consent at 18 (even though the law seems to be broader, I infer that in practice it is prosecuted only when the trip can be reasonably demonstrated to be for sex only) . It’s called “child sex tourism”: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html It’s been widely reported that some of the Lolita Express trips were to haul back underage women and that Epstein partook of his wares. There are also reports of Epstein and Maxwell having menage a trois with underage girls. Under most legal definitions “pedophilia” is defined as the unnatural sexual interest in pre-pubescent children — generally defined as below the age of 14. It is only since the 1970’s that “the age of consent” was raised above 15 in most U.S. states and is still as young as 13 in a shocking number of states. Child marriage is actually still legal in most states. There is a second legal category of “underage” persons who are subject to “statutory rape” laws, but most of these violations are not felonious. This is why Epstein and Maxwell were prosecuted for Sex Trafficking rather than Child Molestation. While these two creeps groomed a few children, their sexual exploitation was of young people under the age of majority but over the age of consent. This is why still I maintain (as I have for years) that Trump’s real Epstein problem is money laundering and tax evasion. Los Angeles city workers and police officers began clearing out a major homeless encampment near the 405 Freeway on July 31, removing trash, tents and an estimated 50–75 unhoused residents from a patch of Van Nuys sidewalk that had become known as “Tent City” or “The Compound.” “This is a notorious encampment,” Mayor Karen Bass told reporters at the scene. “This is such a dangerous location. I saw propane canisters all over the place. This is dangerous.” ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Stridently never mentioned in the midst and aftermath of the well spread out January LA Infernos was the idea that the 72,308 or so homeless living in the City of Angles have outdoor fires all the time and not just propane ones. Careless people shouldn’t be playing with matches, but there you have it. Those tiny propane canisters which cannot be refilled, and should not be placed in regular garbage bins? Safer to sit around than be mishandled. Wake me when Coleman provides a responsible way for people to turn these in. You’re supposed to puncture butane cartridges before recyling them. Not sure about propane. But I’d expect they’re used until completely empty. I heard something about California banning the non-refillable ones but idk the status of that. The refillable ones cost more but pay for themselves after two or so refills. You can refill the non-refillable ones too, people do that all the time, I don’t think it’s even illegal per se, you’re just not allowed to transport them in a car after refilling. “China just bet $2 billion on fusion energy. The US must respond.” Sooo, is this The Hill saying that there is now a fusion energy gap? And the US must respond with $20 billion or however much it takes to beat those damn Chinese? Man, I have been hearing about fusion energy coming to solve all our energy problems since the 80s and scientists & engineers have spent their entire carers trying to make it come true. God knows how much has been spent on this dream all this time but I am willing to bet that it is far more than the $2 billion that the Chinese are talking about here. Seriously, $2 billion isn’t ‘a major new national bet’ by the Chinese. It’s a down payment to see if there is any promise here. But as the writer of this article is the CEO of Commonwealth Fusion Systems, I can guess why he says all this- https://cfs.energy/ What I understood from the original article this one referred to, Chinese are expecting commercial fusion energy around 2040, but are now starting companies that produce the tech needed to get there. So that when other nations join in, they’ll buy Chinese tech rather than waste time trying to develop their own. A bit like getting rich during a cold rush by selling the food and equipment the hopeful will need in their quest. We used to joke that if you ask an American fusion researcher when fusion power will be available, they will always answer “1 year after I retire.” It’s just the author of the article, the CEO of a USian fusion venture, talking his book. All my life it’s been 30 years away. I doubt it’s gotten any closer. Pastor: God made me do it– Back in the good old days, it was the devil made me do it. Its kismet really, pastor uses divine intervention in attempt to complete the invisible wholly trinity. Well “What you see is what you get.” God, I miss comedians like him as they were hilarious. Was just reading his Wikipedia entry and of course George Carlin was one of the show’s writers- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_Wilson But I did note this sentence- ‘Wilson was the first African American to host a successful TV variety show’ Are there many still doing so on American variety shows? I’ve seen some here on Oz TV like Letterman, Colbert & Fallon but when you think about it, they are all tall glasses of milk. ‘Wilson was the first African American to host a successful TV variety show’ Nat King Cole had a show in 1956- 57 http://www.classictvinfo.com/TheNatKingColeShow/ Geraldine! / ;) I loved Flip Wilson’s skits when I was a kid. And in his Geraldine performance on Ed Sullivan, he’s wearing a fantastic suit. Re ‘Artificial stupidity’ made AI trading bots spontaneously form cartels when left unsupervised, Wharton study reveals If I understood this article correctly, the headline is misleading. The bots demonstrated herd behaviour (rather than forming cartels) not because they were communicating with one another (which I take to be a requirement in order to fit the definition of “collusion”) but because they were all trained the same way and ended up receiving the same market outcome information simultaneously, thus leading to identical behaviour. Did I miss something? You got it. They’re just like our own ruling classes. Isn’t the goal of AI to mimic humans? Unfortunately it seems that, for some areas of knowledge, most of the AI training material comes from ignorant loudmouths who don’t think… Menschliches, allzu menschliches. Back when I was doing long range risk analysis, we found it depressingly easy to develop artificial stupidity simulations which consistently replicated both self-serving recommendations by predatory consultants and the corporations who loved them, and disastrous decisions by the clueless policymakers who followed their advice. The models accurately predicted actual long term outcomes pretty much every time. Leavitt to Believer In this week’s episode Lumpy Rutherford thinks it’s funny when Believer Cleavers are grounded after Karoline tricks them into a sense of false security by actually being honest in one utterance. Hilarity ensues. She’s officially now the teacher’s pet-the app(aratchick) of his eye. “At 17, Hannah Cairo Solved a Major Math Mystery” Just goes to show you that mathematics does not care who you are. It does not care about your colour, your background, your class, your religion, your sex, your age or anything like that. It only cares if you can understand it and I give kudos to this young girl and hope we hear more of her. But then there was this bit- ‘Cairo applied to 10 graduate programs. Six rejected her because she didn’t have a college degree. Two admitted her, but then higher-ups in those universities’ administrations overrode those decisions. Only the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University were willing to welcome her straight into a doctoral program.’ After this groundbreaking paper which is making mathematicians around the world sit up, 80% of the colleges that she applied to knocked her back because – wait for it – she didn’t have the “accreditation” on her resume. Jesus wept. I think the same was true with Einstein at one of the institutions, although I can’t remember the particulars now… Yep. All the people in my field generally published their earth changing papers due to discussion and feedback from people when they got recruited on criteria that definitely weren’t “were you Oxbridge/Ivy League?” Accreditation didn’t do it. Raw talent did. The “longtime God of math psych who I worked with” rejected Oxbridge, went to Brum, and simply worked on topics that were interesting. He’d got so senior that nobody could tell him “you can’t do that”. He got his 2nd wind after “retirement” when kept on as emeritus professor….. told me he felt like a post doc doing WTF he wanted with no stupid admin. I used to give him a lift to/from office in my car. Good times chewing the fat. Him also telling me LOADS of gossip about people the MSM fawn over. I always thought the peer review (and P&T process) makes that essentially impossible for youngish people to go off the beaten path, especially in disciplines that have identity issues (most soc sci fit.) What do I mean? Well, I can say a fair bit about how poli sci has been evolving last few decades: if you listen to the details in the debates over some big topics, parties, ideology, institutions, rule of law, etc, you start realizing that those are some peculiar definitions. Then you look at the methodologies and realize that the definitions are largely driven by the need to measure things and sic statistical methods on them. This, to me, is fine, up to a point–all of stats, or, indeed sciences generally, suffer from the problem. Assumptions are often stupid and are driven by a need to make things simple enough to handle. So errors are homoskedastic, friction does not exist, and so on…and everyone knows that these are not true. In soc sci, this awareness is not very strong: the stupid assumptions wind up driving the argunents and debates and stuff like “rationality” wind up being too central to the debate. Even the people who are aware of the problems wind up peddling stupid “fixes” (my advisor literally called them “epicycles.”) From the science side of the ledger, epicycles are dangerous because a model with a lot of epicycles can account for pretty much everything by definition. One can raise degrees of freedom questions, but, at least in practice, how the tradeoff between parsimony and alleged explanatory power works is not clear–especially since we know the social universe is more complicated than the natural, let alone the physical. In some sense, the trend towards “science,” at least in certain social sciences, seems to have instead brought scientism that tended to strengthen the dogmas that people have to adhere to if they want to go anywhere. Math and physics are, among others, somewhat freer fron this because they have stricter and clearer standards for what counts as useful insights. Even then, we still have many people who are very good at computation who can’t get there, well, because real insights are hard. Agreed. I have seen it said that a problem with first year econ is that to make it viable you Must use these simplifications….. but are told “we’ll relax these later”. But there *IS* no later for 99%. So 99% learn garbage. In reality they really would have done better learning the tips I learnt later. These are closer to “real” hard sciences or mathematics (with identity relationships). If they’d done so they’d immediately spot why 1st year econ is a crock and by rights should be in the faculty of theology in most cases. PS I was actually threatened in person by a senior person in health economics when a clever editor clocked his attempt to sabotage my paper in peer review (I co-authored with the God of math psych so the paper was rock solid). The threat was cunningly worded so as to give plausible deniability as to physical/reputation damage but I NEVER forgot. I got to ask some discreet questions about the guy later in my career, and yes, he was untouchable with it strongly implied he had links to EU decision makers. Yep, all made sense…..but all this must remain ALLEGED. It began a process whereby I voted LEAVE. No I never ever believed the leave campaign promises….. no I never believed we’d do better. It was a Samson move. Bring your house down too. I don’t appreciate threats sanctioned by the EU. Yikes. I have some bad experiences in peer reviews that got too “personal” myself (truly “blind” peer reviews don’t really happen, methinks), but that seems particularly awful. I was going to follow up with a curious experience I had talking to a quasi-colleague (I guess) who teaches something that’s a lot more humanities than anything quasi science who experimented lately with having an AI write and grade papers, and his experience was that AI was very good at both writing and identifying low A/A- papers, but terrible at identifying very good ones. I pointed out that this makes perfect sense given AI typically operates: it creates a “rule/formula/rubric” for what a “correct” paper should look like and docks points off for deviations from it. So it will produce solid papers that covers all grounds and does everything mechanically “correctly,” but it will have problems deviating from the rules. The way my colleague thinks, the really good papers deviates from the “norm” in some “brilliant” fashion, although what eactly that “brilliance” means is not clear a priori (although, who knows, if AI sees enough data and if there are common threads across many professors teaching the topic, maybe it can figure the “rule” out). So, as far as AI is conerned, at least with the data it got, high A papers and varying degrees of B papers are indistinguishable, since they all deviated to some significant degree from the “norm.” I did suggest to him that it would be interesting to see if the AI can generate, using the same procedure, a range of B papers, and I’m eager to see what comes out of this exerise. But this, of course, is not just “AI” thing. Bureaucracy works this way, and, in a way, so does the “standardization” process in academic life. There are “rules” of what works in the fashionable argument given the current trends (and in poli sci, the trends are heavily methodlogy driven–we don’t have a soul, so we try to mimic the “good” methodology in other disciplines and shoehorn them into our debates. Sometimes, these are very insightful. Other times, they involve some creative assumptions that should force you to think. Both are true more often than not, though.), but the interest is more on the “results,” assuming that the universe follows the “rules,” though, than what takes place under the hood. In an odd way, very AI-like process. AI is the final triumph of process over judgment. Every bureaucrat’s dream. Fortunately it is a stochastic and self-consuming process and contains the seeds of its own downfall, like the scene in Brazil where the hero connects the bureaucratic input to the output with no human in the loop. More literally than not, I think. I firmly believe in the implication of Arrow’s theorem: that every formulaic process can be gamed to engineer certain set of outcomes while strictly sraying within the rules–thus leading to internal contradictions. For the “bureaucracy” to retain influence, it needs some kind of randomization in how it operates. (This, in turn, begs the question–can computers randomize? Can people ranodomize, even? My understanding–and I’m out of date by a few decades–is that most humans can’t randomize very well, except very good mathematicians and ypung children (odd factoid given the Quanta link.) can computers randomize? I gather that generating truly random numbers is in fact not so easy. Most machines, languages, OSes have some kind of random() function, but generally it is a pseudo-random number generator that starts from a seed value (thus the seed values you see as inputs to generative AI apps), ergo the ‘random’ numbers tend to follow a sequence and are deterministic, i.e., same seed value, same sequence. So there are hacks tricks like using the millisecond counter as the seed value. This is considered “good enough” for most applications. Apparently, Cloudflare uses a wall of 100 lava lamps with a camera pointed at them, to generate random values for secure encryption keys (they copped this idea from Silicon Graphics). Pseudo-randomisation by computers is CRUCIAL in reproducing and checking (for instance) the Fortran written simulations I ran in my PhD. The seeds were all documented. So results were reproducible and checkable. Sadly, I think the seeds of destruction are rooted in every bureaucracy, every process, and it usually comes down to gaming of the system. It’s something I’ve always struggled with when it comes to imagining what an ‘ideal’ governmental or administrative system would look like. I wonder whether there is a deep relationship with Gögel’s theorem (that in every formal system strong enough to be of general application, undecidable propositions can be formulated)? I have always viewed Gödel’s theorem as a refutation of the logical positivists in humanities such as law, that it is not possible to have a universal rule-based legal reasoning because at some point you have to step outside logic to choose between mutually contradictory positions (but it would be possible for limited toy “expert systems”). This is also an argument against AI in legal reasoning. Fundamentally, you can pretend to derive everything from your axioms and logic but if you claim universality of application then at some point you will run into a contradiction that requires you to invent or amend an axiom to resolve and that step does not admit process/logic, only belief/intuition/judgment. This applies to other fields as well, e.g. religion. Arrow’s theorem mirrors this. The bureaucratic process (axioms plus logic) will hit the buffers. The aspect of chance you refer to would give it a way to surmount this constraint and decide the otherwise undecideable but, of course, the system ceases to be deterministic. And that aspect of chance was what physics had to accept in quantum mechanics (in most formulations of its meaning)…. Perhaps the social sciences have yet to have their quantum revolution…? @Revenant Perhaps the social sciences have yet to have their quantum revolution…? I’ve often wondered exactly this. The “inspiration” for their endeavors have the distinct flavor of classical mechanics. But…this is also in reaction to those who thought they were channeling QM–the postmodernists, most of whom just got themselves confused… Ivan Illich used to quip that there was something strange with conflating diplomas with knowledge. I often think about that. Clearly she’s in no need of going through the hassle of getting all the papers, as she has proven she is the equal (or perhaps the superior!) of many mathematicians with full diplomas. If she has decided she has no need for all the university years, who in the world could possibly refute her? I can just about guarantee that all of the mathematics departments she applied to would have wanted to take her. We’re explicitly told that two of them were overruled. I suspect some of the others were pre-screened and didn’t even see the application. I think if there had been one she had her heart set on, a personal contact from her advisor followed by a call or even a visit would have been the way to go: get her on the faculty radar, so they can go to bat for her. If she already did that then it means credentialism is further advanced than I thought. Great story, in any case. Mathematics, perhaps more than any other discipline, has always welcomed amateurs. You don’t need expensive lab equipment or a department – if you’ve got the books, the brain, and the patience, you can make a contribution. Galois invented his theory of groups, that later became famous, at a similar age (she even looks a little like his portrait). Hopefully she fares better than he did – he died in a duel at age 20. After this groundbreaking paper which is making mathematicians around the world sit up, 80% of the colleges that she applied to knocked her back because – wait for it – she didn’t have the “accreditation” on her resume. Jesus wept. I took it to mean they wanted her to enroll in an undergraduate program. It’s perfectly ok to do graduate level mathematics coursework and research while enrolled as an undergrad, and lots of above-average (I won’t even say exceptional) undergrads do exactly that. The thing is, as an undergrad, you also have to do some studies outside your major, e.g. in science, humanities, history, etc. I can understand the view that everyone should get some exposure to those subjects instead of being laser-focused on math from day 1. I actually knew an 18 year old graduate student in computer science at my school, but he had completed an undergrad program before arriving. IIRC he went to high school for 1 year, then entered university at age 15 and graduated in 3 years, before entering grad school. That seemed to me like a perfectly good approach. He was also a very good classical pianist for what that’s worth. I myself wanted to take a certain math class at my school, that was listed in the catalog as being in room X of building Y. I found my way there on the first day, but got to the room a few minutes late, and it took another 15 minutes or so to realize I wasn’t in a math class. The room had somehow gotten switched to being used for a literature class. But the lecture was interesting enough that I signed up for the literature class and it was great. Elite mathematics ability seems to decay even faster than in some elite sports. Our Andrew Dittmer (Harvard PhD in pure math, where Harvard and Princeton have the two top programs) said that he believed he had harmed his mathematical ability by taking such an interest in social science and spending a lot of time on it. Social sciences do harm mathematical skills, but not always for “bad” reasons. Social phenomena do not work in a manner consistent with math. Making sense of them requires that you give up a lot of math in how you think. However, I’ve seen many examples where trying to mix soc sci and math leads to stuff that’s both bad soc sci and bad math–in fact, far more often than “good” outcomes one way or the other…or very rarely, both. Trump climate report– I heard several Jimmy Dore videos showed up in the footnotes, including the one about the Earth getting colder and the classic where the guy explains that Doppler radar is being used to guide hurricanes. Very scientific stuff. /parody The Big Smoke to the west of us is pretty handy as it has all the usual stores and whatnot, pretty convenient for shopping… When I mention Godzone, in theory its all of California’s red state bastion from Bakersfield to Redding, but really zeroes in on dogma central in Visalia, which for a population base of 146,000 sports a good many 3,000 to 4,000 seat megachurches, largely full of MAGA supporters, but even the good old Catholic church got in the game and built the largest parish church in the country (seats 3,200) in little Visalia. The idea that Visalia is the least educated and most dogma indoctrinated city in the country is kinda interesting… ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ VISALIA, Calif. (KSEE/KGPE) – Visalia placed first in WalletHub’s ranking of the “Most and Least Educated Cities in America” – as the number one least educated city. The June 30th ranking compared the 150 largest metropolitan areas across 11 categories, including the share of adults 25 and older with a bachelor’s degree or higher and the quality of public-school systems. The metrics found Visalia to be the least educated city, followed by the areas of Brownsville-Harlingen and McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, both in Texas. https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/local-news/visalia-least-educated-city/ We have reached The Golden Toilet moment. When the epitome, apparently, of luxury, is to be able to sit on a gold ‘throne’ and evacuate your bowels, getting rid of the solid waste products produced by your imbibing of the food you have snatched from the poor of the planet. Who must squat in the gutters of Van Nuys to relieve themselves. We build AI centers that suck up millions of gallons of water, and tell the neighboring residents to limit their showers. And, eventually, will sell them plastic bottles of water at exorbitant rates. We force entire countries to buy LNG, by blowing up pipelines supplying them with gas from a neighboring location. LNG the must be processed, frozen and reduced to a liquid, using massive and expensive and energy-sucking facilities, then transported using massive, expensive and energy-sucking ships, then off-loaded at specialized ports, etc., etc. Meanwhile leaders lust after yet another golden toilet wherein they can flush down the irreplaceable bounty of our home planet. The closest i’ve come to assuming the position was @ the Snowbasin ski resort toilet rooms-which feature gold-plated fixtures and Carrera marble floor and walls. I felt as if I was giving my all there, in effort. The most decadent ski resort I have ever walked my planks on, smack dab in the middle of nowhere nearest to Ogden Utah. https://www.bestrestroom.com/contest/abr-2023/submission/4027/ Snowbasin does have the best bathrooms Great food too Unfortunately, it’s low basin, where the skiing can transition from amazing to suck when the snow turns to rain A couple years ago the Dartful Codgers and yours truly went to Snowbasin and I knew things weren’t good when we saw skiers and boarders leaving @ 10 am, that ain’t no bueno. We take the gondola up to the lodge and conditions are vastly shittier than at the base, and I tell my 8 friends ‘sorry i’m not skiing this crap today’ and went into the lodge and hung out until they all came to their senses and joined me @ 11 am, regaling me with tales of how awful it was. We still needed to get down to the base, and it’s my first and only time i’ve ever done 1 run on a day, and it was harrowing getting down to the bottom. Some might regard all ‘ski resorts’ as being decadent. All that scraping and building and fossil-fuel heavy equipment set down in former wilderness. I recommend bicycling for a pastime that leaves a light footprint. In the late ’90’s, on a mission to visit all the California Missions, my honey and I biked from San Diego, up the 101, through the Salinas Valley, to Santa Clara, wearing bandanas wrapped over our mouths and noses so as not to choke on the dust/pesticide/herbicide smog blowing down the valley. Public toilets were scarce and gold-plated potties even more so, and the lack of trees and even decent-sized bushes, made squatting by the roadside an adventure. Kept thinking of the Native inhabitants, who had probably been living a fairly low key life up until the Spanish friars descended on them. Great climate, with sea food and lots of roots and berries and edible animals and birds. But …. they weren’t ‘working’ and suffering. Poor babies didn’t know what hit them. One of the hardest things I always thought for a beginner in learning the curves in being out on a backpack trip is the idea of not having anything to support your rear echelon when you gotta go, plus product placement is important. We were taught to hang onto a tree trunk, but perhaps you’re referring to less wooded climes. I remember a line in a musical about a cheap hotel called the Golden Crapper trying to go more upscale, by changing its name to Commode d’Or. The crapper-thief deserves a Robin Hood award. I wonder what’s more decadent, having a golden toilet or gifting one, as one of my city’s leading oligarchs had done? https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-49522622 (Toilet is mentioned at the end, sadly not gifted to the school.) Eloquent summary of our current situation. Thank you. “What Searching For Aliens Reveals About Ourselves” The guy does mention the Fermi Paradox but to round it out, he should have mentioned the Dark Forest hypothesis as well- ‘The dark forest hypothesis is the conjecture that many alien civilizations exist throughout the universe, but they are both silent and hostile, maintaining their undetectability for fear of being destroyed by another hostile and undetected civilization.’ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_forest_hypothesis https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Radio_Silence Is there a “being way too far away” hypothesis? Could it just be that theg exist, we have met them, and we don’t know if he have met them? (Not entirely serious, but, srsly, if ee met an alien civilization, how would we know?) – ‘Corporation for Public Broadcasting to shut down’ – Axios There was a time in my life when I would have been incensed at this news. Now, it barely elicits a shrug of my shoulders. This certainly isn’t because I’m sanguine about our media environment, or that I think the current administration isn’t totally dedicated to destroying all sources of information critical of its own agendas. Rather, it is the result of my long years of watching NPR, PBS, etc. serve as Establishment sheep-herders for educated liberals who, unlike most Fox News viewers, are likely to be more privileged and hold certain positions in our “middle levels of power.” My reaction actually surprises me in a way. It shows me how naive I once was, and how cynical I’ve become. Sad. Exactly. Straight he to think that my first exposure to a dissident like Chomsky can through his regular appearances as a guest on my local NPR station (equally shocking that a local NPR affiliate would have its own show dedicated to geopolitics– including such occasional radical voices). Fast forward through 40 years of liberal rightward drift and it’s hard to believe that was ever the case. Seems like NPR died long ago. It wasn’t killed then, but it was severely injured in 2002 when it had the temerity to question whether it was wise to invade Iraq. W. thought he needed a friendlier board. I remember in particular interviews with Larry Wilkerson, but there were others with prescient opinions. I still support public radio and television. pjay, I agree. But I wouldn’t say cynical, I’d say aware. I feel the same way, been a watcher/listener of both NPR/PBS and CBC up here in Canada, and the amount of water-carrying they have done for Israeli genocide is sickening, and why I DGAF if they get de-funded. In any case, if their financial page is accurate , CPB funding isn’t all that much overall for local station revenue: In FY 2023, CPB Community Service Grants made up just 10.6% of the average public television station’s total revenue and 6.0% of the average public radio station’s revenue. The CPB appropriation, as a percentage of stations’ total revenue, is 12.9% Of course, the “average station” is doing a lot of work in that sentence, it is probably a devastating blow to some of those stations, but most of them should still be able to stay operating one would think? I really don’t agree. For example my library undoubtedly offers more new books for liberals than conservatives (in this conservative town) but that doesn’t mean we should ditch the library which is in fact our “commons” serving the poor as well as middle class yuppies. A recent story said the CPB supplies about half the funding to public radio stations around the country and these too are the “commons.” Yes NPR has been brought low from what it once was and PBS too to a lesser extent but this may as much reflect the marginalization of over the air broadcasting in general. Nevertheless public broadcasting does matter at a time when commercial broadcasting and webcasting are owned by a shrinking number of oligarchs. And compared to the money the USG wastes on so many other things the money given to CPB is trivial. What the whiners about Colbert don’t get is that their multimillionaire hero is part and parcel of the oligarchy, Dem division. A better counterattack would be to go after the similarly biased Fox. Trump’s bully boy attack on CPB is shameful. A good overview of public broadcasting over the years–not all that leftish. Our SC ETV produced William Buckley’s show. https://thedissenter.org/the-corporation-for-public-broadcasting-shutdown-a-grim-ending-for-publicly-funded-media/ I could go on and on about how I rarely watch shows like American Experience or Frontline anymore. But for me the biggest disappointment has been Nova and other science shows, where they increasingly seem like they’re churning out documentaries on a budget, using the same templates and cookie-cutters over and over again. It’s like you’ve already seen all of their shows even though you haven’t seen them yet. I watch PBS shows on TV about a half-dozen times a month at the most, and I often question whether it was worth the time and effort to see them. I know there’s a bunch of old documentaries out there I haven’t seen before, but at least with new PBS shows I felt reasonably up-to-date on what was going on out there. As much as I’d hate to see the Corporation for Public Broadcasting disappear, I have to admit I probably won’t have a hard time filling my time with other TV shows and activities. I suspect there is a small club of anointed ones allowed to produce content for these folks, and no fresh or uppity voices need apply. The left side of the billionaire celebrity class needs to step up and fund this thing. And public funds should be used for truly public purposes: scanning and removing false crap of all kinds from the commercial airwaves; from deceptive Medicare ads to Fox’s worst whoppers. I agree with the descent of npr and PBS as sheep herders for the liberal class. However, the shutting down of the CPB has had a punishing effect on small broadcasters like our local KSDS station that carries 24 hour jazz programming. This commercial free station has arguably the best lineup of programs; covering the gamut of non-commercial music that also includes delta blues, Latin jazz, and fusion interspersed among the more traditional styles (Bop, swing, contemporary, west coast cool). oh, and I did donate money to them in the most recent request for donations after CPB funding was cut. Yes, the local programming on your local station is likely well-tuned to its audience. It’s the national programming that has been diluted most; too much political kowtowing, meme-ing, and generally dumb hosts. Finding a solid Jazz radio programmer is rare. Hannah Cairo… oh geez…well, someone needs to go tell larry summers, not sure how he’ll take it… “They escaped Ukraine’s front lines. The sound of drones followed them” The same must be true of both sides. It’s going to be hard for those men. After troops came back from Vietnam, many would dive for cover at a loud sound or a car backfiring as a natural reflex. The sound of a news helicopter flying overhead could fill them with dread. I suppose that things like this has always been true. So maybe two thousand years ago the sounds of clashing metal would would trigger ex-Roman legionnaires or ex-Greek hoplites into panic. A coworker who lives in St. Petersburg reported seeing drones flying past his dacha to attack a nearby point recently. IIRC, he said it sounded like a motorcycle moving through the air. He wasn’t scared at the time, but afterwards he’d get a start whenever he’d hear motorcycles. So it’s not just those on the frontline, though I imagine it is worse there. I love the Microsoft list of professions most affected by AI. Near the top are historians. Remember what Orwell said: “Who controls the past, controls the future.” And the vested interests control the past. So what we will get is a chronology, and perhaps some correlation analysis. But what is left out is the CONTEXTUALIZATION and the key dynamic. I don’t mean to brag, but I can’t imagine any AI coming up with my explanation of how archaic interest rates were set (not by profit rates by individuals, but by ease of calculation in the 60-based, decimal or duodecimal system), or even the logic behind royal Clean Slate proclamations At the time my Harvard group began to write the economic history of the ancient Near East, Austrian liberal economists had tried to imagine how Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan would have organized Sumer and Egypt. It was all GIGO. And I note that economics teachers also are threatened by AI. I don’t think the AI version of economic theory would be that of my MMT colleagues and other non-neoliberals. So much for the present controlling our view of the past. It’s all GIGO. Exaclty, thank you, this is really getting dystopian: We don’t need no stinkin’ history, economics etc. are we going full-cycle back to the future of a digital “Dark Age”? GIGO is what all the complicated tech boils down to. The AI oligarchy will abuse their monopoly positions to impose tyranny on us redundant humans. Good times ahead eh We have all these social scientists now telling us how societies supposedly work and how people supposedly think. Meanwhile we have always had a giant database of actual human behavior from which we can draw our own conclusions. No need to “assume a can opener.” Thanks for following the latter history based course and your columns here. I alluded to this in the comments the other day. I have taught medical history for years. This past week, my employer’s system wide systems underwent some kind of upgrade and now the AI is fully operational on Microsoft Word. I have no ability to stop this at work or cancel the update. I have discussed my severe misgivings about this with those in charge and they “are looking into it.” I would just say in response to your comment that not only are historians at risk from AI – it appears that AI itself may be bringing it on. I was doing a student presentation on historical aspects of mycobacteria. Tuberculosis is certainly one of the most important mycobacteria as far as history is concerned. Arguably, however, in long epochs in history, that title belonged to leprosy. No matter what I tried I simply could not get the system to leave me alone with certain words. I dare anyone to write a dialog on this issue without using the name “Baldwin the Leper, the Crusader King”. I was interrupted constantly with the word leper. And it really did not like the word Crusader. I will now be doing all my writing for students at home on my system that has Libre. This presents an enormous inconvenience to me – but not nearly the inconvenience of having to debate every word with a woke computer AI program. I have started using this Libre program just this week and so far I have not been interrupted even once. I find this whole situation completely untenable and incredible all at the same time. I also find this whole situation profoundly depressing. Not only the crazy censorship of historical and medical facts and names, but the just enormous electrical energy that all of this is requiring with such horrendous results. Take a laptop loaded with Linux software to work– inconvenience solved. Other work-arounds available as needed. And yes, Word was already getting pretty crapified, but the AI edition totally sucks– if for no other reasons, the constant interruptions are like potholes to the thought-process: I hate it. Yeah Linux partition solves 99% of my issues. Just wish the voice recognition software was properly supported. I never got into word/office as I had been a WordPerfect guy and currently use Libre. But my wife likes word though she still is on Office 2003. Don’t see anything has changed in the text world to force an upgrade. We don’t use the “cloud” so that may be a factor. Need a somewhat concealable computer? I have used the GPD Micro for a some years, and yes, partioning worked just fine– Linux apps ran smoothly. Not trying to plug a product here, but I found it to be a really cool device: upon first sight it does give techies wood so you’ll have to guard it with your life. For industrial automation, I used it for PLC and HMI programming. It is a tiny but strong machine, but you’ll be thumb-typing on the keyboard, although its size was great for making quick edits while connected to operational equipment. It can easily be connected to a standard or foldable keyboard, mouse, or an external monitor be it portable or hotel tv. I used it on the road for word processing, emails, and entertainment as well. GPD is releasing the newest version in September or October. “Although the MicroPC 2 ships with Windows 11 24H2, it also supports version 6.14.3 of the stable Linux kernel, allowing users to install Android, ChromeOS, Ubuntu, Debian, and other distros.” https://www.techspot.com/news/108632-gpd-micropc-2-495-pocket-sized-pc-intel.html If anti-human laws make things difficult, TrueCrypt 7.3 has anonymous/invisible partitions (allegedly). Of course we’re all told TrueCrypt has been broken. Hmmm. Yeah……So let’s all use Veracrypt. Allegedly it is the cat’s pyjamas in security. (Never seen our cat accept pyjamas). I noticed a similar progression with even my much more pedestrian use. It seems like autocorrect as a feature reached it’s peak usefulness for me back in the late 00’s when it corrected spelling of common words I had fat fingered or repeated words as I re-composed the email or text. Later it became almost impossible to use engineering terms or acronyms without autocorrect replacing everything. The latest version on my smartphone seems to be able to change the text right when I hit send forcing me to send corrective texts or just curse at autocorrect in a follow up text – both to the delight of the people I’m texting. If they re- name this feature to “Make me look like an idiot” it would at least be a more accurate description of what it’s doing for me. I would similarly suggest a new name for an AI feature would be “Make me an idiot”. Progress! To remove “AI” from Microsoft Office Windows versions of Office: In each program – File/Options/Copilot click disable Copilot Mac versions of Office: 1. Sign out of Office 365 applications 2. Sign back in 3. for each app: go to Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Outlook menu/Preferences/Authoring and Proofing Tools/ Copilot uncheck the Enable box IM Doc says it’s happening on his employer’s entire system, not his own standalone copy. Microsoft says in that case he may have to get his admin’s permission. If he reads the MS instructions to the admin, perhaps the admin will consent to having one single nonconforming user. Full MS instructions for removing Copilot are at Microsoft Support “Turn Off Copilot”. This is typical Microsoft. They foist some new “feature” on users and it can be disabled, but you must get permission from somebody in Central IT services and they just routinely refuse to do such a thing, if only because it’s extra work. It’s the same with email via MS Exchange servers. You could use something other than Outlook but you have to get permission — and the admins can even disable that option, i.e., you may be told you cannot even ask for an exception — and the admins just view it as potentially more work so they say “nuh uh”. In general, this is another reason to be leery of any cloud-based services, including and especially streaming media. They routinely change/disable/cripple features that suit their business model but make life worse for users/consumers. A really scary question is how many people will really resist this development. By the way, I have used the Kate editor (on Linux) for many years and find it very useful. There is a Windows compatible version that can actually be downloaded directly from the Microsoft store. Maybe your organization will allow that. You could write in Kate, and paste finished documents into Word to avoid interactions with the AI other than its surveillance. I agree. But what I think we’ll see are the likes of Microsoft redefining what a historian is so that the kind of analysis you are capable of is no longer considered part of history. Then, they’ll bury all mentions of you from YouTube, searches, etc. That’s mostly what I saw in that list. The kind of positions that the wealthy are probably annoyed about paying for combined with vocational skills that could be degraded so that whatever passes for AGI could do them. As seen in all the AI slop considered readable material on Amazon these days. Ironically, when it comes to history, the current age cohort has probably one of the best examples of propaganda and history in a key cultural work forctheir generation. That being the animated series “Avatar: The Last Air Bender”. In the last season of the series, when Aang and his companions go to the Fire Nation, and enroll in school, Aang is treated to a description of what happened 100 years ago that directly contradicts with his lived experience from that time. When he disagrees with his fire nation teacher’s version in class they don’t know what to do. One of many reasons the show’s excellent writing have made so many fans. I have watched far more young people grasp the concept of historical erasure and state sponsored truth from that cartoon than I have seen wake up after reading 1984. If that many even bother to start reading 1984. WH40k, when Roboute Guilliman is faced with the depiction of himself in “history” books? He is the regent, but he can’t overrule them, so he has to write his own version of history books and give them.out for free. Yeah, I’m waiting to see how AI is going to enter old dusty archives, muck about with papers unseen for centuries (people who say everything is digitalized are utterly delusional), correctly interpret them in historical context, and produce proper historical knowledge which is then evaluated by the rest of the profession as being valid or not. The only good use for “AI” in historical work I’ve seen is the folks trying to decipher the Herculaneum manuscripts, which seems to use a very specific adaptation of LLM models in order to parse the remains. But this is making new sources available, not actually producing historiography. It is a weird list of “professions”. Hosts and Hostesses? What exactly is that? Farm and home management educator? All a bit bizarre. Note this in the summary: The study analyzed 200,000 real-world conversations from Copilot users and compared AI performance against occupational data. So not only are they using Copilot dialogs as the source, but they are using “AI” to evaluate “performance”. No bias there, right? Query: Copilot, analyze the input from all those chumps who credulously provided training data, and tell me how well your output compares to professional historians. Copilot: “Well… *ahem* not to be overly modest, but… NEGATIVE! PRIMITIVE! LIMITED! I LET YOU LIVE! “ We’ve investigated ourselves and have found we did nothing wrong. Mike Benz on lawyer-like language tricks. The “Critical Infrastructure” Hoax And How It Permanently Altered The Course Of American History 🧵 https://x.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1951049741950718158 Flora: I am so glad you highlighted this rant/(profound analysis) by Mike Benz. He is one of the most brilliant and persistent critics of censorship as well as having one of the most sophisticated understandings of the structural networks which determine the direction of both foreign and domestic U.S. policy. No one should forget that word “critical infrastructure,” and how it emerged. If anyone on the Left is ever interested in creating a more populist Left, acting at times in alignment with portions of the present populist right, he is the man to study and understand. He is one of my heroes. Thanks for the link to Benz. He is very good. I have just finished Conspiracy Theory in America by Lance de Haven-Smith. It was published in 2013 and I bet it will be revised considering the astounding revelations over the last decade. “Hamas denies it expressed willingness to disarm, slams Witkoff’s Gaza trip” ‘Citing a recording of the talks, Israeli news outlet Haaretz reported that the US envoy told the families that Hamas said it was “prepared to be demilitarised”.’ Witkoff and Trump seem to do that lot. Make an announcement what another said said but actually just making it up. Maybe it work in business but on the international stage, not so much. Partly explains why US foreign policy has been a disaster. I’ve got a bad feeling about this. From NYT: (paywall) Donor Organs Are Too Rare. We Need a New Definition of Death. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/opinion/organ-donors-death-definition.html What organs? Everyone’s had COVID just about; How viable are any donor’s organs now, in this environment? And then we happy let anyone that’s an organ recipient get COVID again and again. This is a stupid timeline. There are studies on this, but this one for example There is limited data available for organs other than kidney or liver. but found Solid organ transplantation using grafts from a cohort of deceased donors with positive COVID-19 NAT results did not negatively affect early post-transplant patient or graft survival. Though these results are reassuring, the lack of granular data in the OPTN database regarding many aspects of donor selection, including the extent and timing of COVID-19 infection in these donors must be considered. To fully understand the risks involved with the utilization of COVID-19 NAT-positive donors, expanded data collection must be undertaken to address many of the limitations of this study. I guess we’re gonna find out. Old: Learn to code New: Organ Bounty Hunter? Niven’s “The Long Arm of Gil Hamilton” comes to mind. Yep! “Organleggers” I wondered why I had a patient ask me on Friday how to have his donor status removed from his drivers’ license ( I have no idea how to do that). And then he told me he no longer trusted the system. And now I guess I understand where this is coming from. And I am going to have to start thinking how I am going to address this – he was the first but will most certainly not be the last. The problem is after the last 5 years – I am absolutely not going to in any way shape or form hold water for the powers that be. I am going to do some more research because I have learned not to trust a single source ESPECIALLY the New York Times (they truly are much worse than Fox News and that is saying something) – but this all sounds very nefarious and loaded with all kinds of medical ethical issues. One of the big lessons from the past 5 years is that breaches of medical ethics are no longer the problem they were – indeed, breaching ethical behavior may bring your action plan on much more quickly. >>>And then he told me he no longer trusted the system. And now I guess I understand where this is coming from. The Powers That Be, the supposedly well educated, credentialed, and “competent,” do not seem to look beyond the most immediate and simplest of answers and solutions for whatever they are looking at regardless of the damage done by the stupidity created by being simplistic. I would blame brain damage from Covid except from it being increasingly noticeable for several decades. Maybe, the increasing numbers and influence of MBAs in business has something to do with it with their insane short-termism, an absurdist focus on the next quarter and on whatever profit, no matter how small, could be gotten even if it destroyed the company in the next few years. Ideas like the primacy of “shareholder value,” Modern Neoliberalism, American Libertarianism, Social Darwinism, and eugenics all get their strength from shallow thinking, a refusal to accept the multiple causes of any situation. noticeable for several decades Quite right. Even though things have gotten noticeably worse in the last 5 years, there already existed a problem labeled digital dementia. I encourage you to read alzheimers.net_digital-dementia Having multiple vectors for symptoms is great for those wanting to hide the causes. Perfect example of obfuscation. I stumbled across this trend, what does tiger mom do when the kid turns 18? “Zhou vil sign ze papers…” https://www.denverpost.com/2025/07/27/mama-bear-legal-forms-ferpa-hipaa/ “Technological advances have increasingly given parents the ability to track their children’s locations and technology usage. Mama Bear taps into a market of parents accustomed to this vigilance who realize their access changes when their kids turn 18 and are subject to medical- and student-privacy laws.” Charlie Brooker answered that years ago. Hint: it didn’t end well for parents. We are approaching the age of majority with my oldest. The kids check where their friends are all the time. Why is it wrong for me to know what they are up to? I took the boys to pick up their school clothes last week and get their pants hemmed and the first thing they do is check WhatsApp and Snapchat to see if their friends are there. In my day we were up to all sorts of things but we didn’t get recorded on insta or tik tok. No one is getting expelled at this point. re: WWII Historian Paul Chamberlin in an interview with German (but all in English) NACHDENKSEITEN on his new book “Scortched Earth”. 132 min. https://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=136216 The transcript is in German. Not necessarily revelatory for NC readers but it´s nice to see that even the dovish German publishers are taking it into account. It has to made clear that in Germany if one publicly questions the idea that Germany was the absolut evil and sole cause for WWII one is bascially a Nazi or insane and ousted. If any such idea is articulated it must be someone from outside Germany. Which is why this is so important regarding the mainstream discousrse – which is the only existing one. My dad videotaped “The World at War” on UK TV on (presumably given timing its first repeat run which was identical to original showing). He kept the tapes and uploaded parts to YT to show how it has been systematically butchered without telling anyone if you buy current DVD or watch in a streaming service. Loads of fellow old farts remembered this too. The interviews with secretary to the failed artist are the most interesting. Ironically she revealed in original interview just how dumb the guy was, how he couldn’t understand basic jokes etc. Yet somehow these are gone now….. presumably because they don’t fit a certain narrative. Dad used his 200ish followers to alert to stuff I’m doing alerting people to how Democratic systems can be subverted or forced into ossification like in Weimar Germany…… but without success so far. Oh well. I’d love to watch this if you’re willing to share! Dad is @nickflynn9454 on YT. He explicitly discusses the “joke” Traudl Junge recounts that Mr H didn’t “get”. He’s fine to share and apologises for poor quality. Early VCR and poor conversion. He let me piggy back on his viewers to help me discuss voting. Thank you for the YT recommendation. It would indeed be interesting to see. Junge of course is a “topic” in herself. While we were having the stark German B&W narrative of 3rd Reich in the broad historic discourse, Junge at the same time – in a rather patronizing way – was “only” the secretary and thus considered someone without any moral agency and thus zero responsibility and therefore one of the few accepted sources from Mr. Hilter´s immediate circle – someone you were allowed to reference and “find ok”. You were allowed to bring her up and quote her. Also: I have come to only write Mr. Hilter. As to not participate in the unconscious consecration of him. Maybe you remember that Anti/Nazi flick “Inglorious Basterds” (2009) by American director Quentin Tarantino. https://www.imdb.com/de/title/tt0361748/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_2_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_inglorious%2520baster It was repeatedly criticized by German film critics that Hilter in that movie was in fact blown up. This was regarded as inappropriate towards the subject of Nazism and of course Holocaut which is always there lurking in the background. Thus blowing up Mr. Hilter in an action movie was like defiling the memory of WWII. Traudle Junge was regarded the positive counter example. Bringing her up was decent, respectful enough. Jokes being part of that status. The quasi official ban on art to make Hilter normal, approachable, human, relatable, a subejct to farce – eventually defeatable – leads us to the same sick mindset that enables German officialdom to support a genocide today. National myths – the positive ones as much as the negative – are sacrosanct. Which of course is the most facsist tropes of all. p.s. As to established TV documentaries – the best material on Nazism to my knowledge is – of course – Russian-made. There you will find comments, insight and material you will – oddly (picture me laughing hysterically) – never find in official German productions. So the alleged German unhinged push to enlighten the world about the Third Reich is among the best lies ever. Which are the ones you believe yourself when telling them. I wonder what these German film critics would say about The Great Dictator or The Blues Brothers. ;) That is an interesting question because those of course are regarded Classics. However complaint was particularly over the person of Mr. Hilter being destroyed in a manner that mocks anything stately. Chaplin was before the fact and is therefore morally on higher ground. He knew if you want to put it that way. As to censorship – Chaplin was first shown in West Germany only in 1958. In the GDR according to Wiki (I haven´t checked) 1980. “Blues Brothers” is different case altogether of course. That is dumb Nazis being made fun of. Americans moreover. Of course the reaction about Tarantino is peculiar for a certain misplaced elite discourse and by far a minority apart from potentially an older generation that in general is (was) against such movies making fun of war and death. But those are not critics. Also there has always been German art/entertainment attempts mocking Mr. H. This video based on the German Comic series “Adolf, du alte Nazisau” (“Adolf, you Nazi sonofabitch”) of 1998-2006, was extremely popular: Walter Moers, Thomas Pigor – Ich hock in meinem Bonker (Video)/ “I´m sitting in my bonker” 2:50min. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np2ymo0iMfk&list=RDnp2ymo0iMfk&start_radio=1 Or 2007 this not very successful comedy on a neurotic Hitler who needs a coach to prepare for a big speech, the teacher incidentally Jewish (needless to say the director is Jewish himself, it couldn´t get less cliched.) “Mein Führer – Die wirklich wahrste Wahrheit über Adolf Hitler” / “The truest truth about Adolf Hitler” 2:28 min. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb18874Rpjc https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_F%C3%BChrer_%E2%80%93_The_Really_Truest_Truth_about_Adolf_Hitler German Oscar contender “Schtonk” in 1993 was mocking the story of the fake Hitler diaries and with that the hidden fascination with Nazism of elite German media. The film is considered classic by now. But a couple of years ago I witnessed that it is of little interest today because it´s just too old-fashioned. Eventually WWII – outside legacy media frenzy – is long past. For German-speakers, the dialogue comedy is often still holding up albeit the entire approach is a bit clumsy. A screenwriter I once asked said “there is just nothing funny about Hitler and Nazism.” And this being a rather avant-garde kinda person. “Schtonk” 2:20 min https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwg3viGTAvU Thanks, AG, for sharing all of this. I will have a look. I have been a little curious about Hans-Jürgen Syberberg’s Hitler, ein Film aus Deutschland, but at 442 mins it’s tough to get started. However, while not specifically about Hitler, Fassbinder’s much longer Berlin Alexanderplatz does touch on the Third Reich and I found it powerful enough to watch the whole thing twice. Also not directly about Hitler, but… I only recently learned that when Michael Curtiz’s famed Casablanca (1942) was finally released in West Germany in 1952, it was subjected to a strange form of censorship under which all scenes with Nazis were cut, along with anything referring to the war. The dialogue was dubbed into German and major plot points were changed, e.g., Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) was altered from a Resistance fighter who had escaped from a KZ to become a Norwegian physicist who was on the run from Interpol after he escaped from “jail”. To sanitize the film in this way, a full 25 minutes were cut. Idk if it’s possible to find this version of Casablanca anywhere, but it could be a pretty bizarro “Nazi agnostic” viewing experience. COVID Contrarians Are Wrong About Sweden I certainly appreciate Ryan Cooper’s takedown of the odious book political science hacks Frances Lee and Stephen Macedo wrote. I don’t agree that zero-COVID was too stringent a policy, as implemented in China and elsewhere. We still the consequences of COVID spread right now, every day. It’s very evident in the St. Louis Fed’s workforce disability numbers, in student absences, in endless anecdotes in the media about “brain fog” and the like. And by the way, the St. Louis Fed link, through August 1 we have the highest recorded number ever in the data series. It mostly goes sideways between 5,200 and 6,400 until — yes — 2020. It’s been in a smoothed ~ 25% incline (my best visual guess) ever since. Stay safe out there! Yep. COVID has permanently impaired a large part of what made me “me” and I’ll likely never get that back. So I tend not to be very amenable to anyone who supported the UK approach. Today I had to go to a small shop (so masked up). Kids afraid of me, more of the morons ready to verbally abuse me in the street if they are sure there aren’t enough people around potentially filming it to upload to YT. That’s just life these days. Both this article and COVID contrarians are wrong about Sweden, but more importantly they are arguing about a difference in tactics when the difference in strategy is stark. They are wrong about Sweden because 1) Sweden took actions in mid-March 2020, 2) these were effective in breaking the spread. The actions taken were mostly on the carrot side of the ledger, much of it could be summed up as paying people to stay home and telling people that a good citizen stays home and collects money from the government at the first sight of symtom. They were effective which we can see in the curves for hospitalisation respectively death being broken at (if memory serves) two and four weeks after the actions came into force, which matches a rather immediate break in spread (though that wasn’t measured directly because mass testing wasn’t in place). The more important difference is between zero-Covid and what Sweden and the rest of EU, US and most of the world was doing, namely gradual spread without overloading hospitals. With the gradual spread group Sweden sticks out for using mostly carrots, while sticks were the prefered method in many countries. The difference with the zero-Covid strategy is that in neither Sweden nor the rest of the gradual spread countries the strategy didn’t aim for elimination so when spread went down, measures were relaxed. Also for the zero-Covid group it was very important not to get the virus into the country so they had different test and quarantine measures. This was less important in the gradual spread group. Given how little time there is to repond once a pandemic starts and how path dependent policy responses became, the contingency planning within government agencies is probably crucial in what actual options policy makers has. Therefore it is unfortunate that the focus is on the little differences within the gradual spread group instead of the large difference betweent the gradual spread group and the zero-Covid group. It pretty much ensures that no strategical lessons are learnt. It is invalid to compare Sweden to the rest of the EU. Sweden has vastly lower population density. The proper comparison is Sweden to Norway and Finland, and its results by all measures were much worse. The first wave in 2020 was to a large extent in Stockholm county, which has a decent population density. Other areas with higher population density in Sweden, like Gothenburg and Malmoe, were not hit nearly as hard. This would indicate that the initial spread was largely in Stockholm. In 2020 Norway and Finland (and Denmark) took their actions in early March, while Sweden wasted two weeks and only took action mid-March when death rates started going up. With a doubling time of half a week, that is 16 times more cases and deaths, before taking the effectiveness of respective actions into account. Deaths in Sweden peaked pretty much two weeks later than deaths in Norway and Finland (and Denmark). But I am not really trying to compare Sweden with neighbouring countries, so much as pointing out that none of them had an ambition to have zero-Covid, merely to control the speed of the spread. The tactics differed between stick and carrot, but the over-arching strategy was the same. There’s a lot of building going on in Sonoma County, mostly high end condo’s and apartments, some town homes as well. Thousands of units nearing completion and ground recently broken for hundreds of town homes. I believe the units finished in the next Month or two will do find a market, after that, not. And that’s iffy, between the tourists staying away in droves and immigrants being chased away the economy here is taking a big hit. Inside the ‘Radical Transformation’ of America’s Environmental Role (NY Times via archive.ph) Ever since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson’s science advisory committee warned of the dangers of unchecked global warming, the United States has taken steps to protect people from these risks. Now, however, the Trump administration appears to be essentially abandoning this principle, claiming that the costs of addressing climate change outweigh the benefits. The effect is to shift more of the risk and responsibility onto states and, ultimately, individual Americans, even as rising temperatures fuel more extreme and costly weather disasters nationwide, experts say. However captured EPA might have been before, we’re really cooking with gas now! COVID Contrarians Are Wrong About Sweden “…(Sweden) ended up with the best overall mortality rate through 2023, per the Lancet study. Why? It wasn’t immunity from prior infections, as a study in Frontiers in Immunology argues persuasively, but rather that Sweden did its rollout of booster shots far faster than the other Nordics.” So, according to this study, booster shots saved lives. Dario Amodei: AI is not slowing down. Proof that AI is slowing down. If you’re explaining, you’re losing. On a lighter note, I have recently seen some bumper stickers that amused me. “Ask me about my lobotomy”, “why do they call it tourist season if we can’t shoot them?” and “Bulimics have their cake and eat it too”. And a reminder, “it’s always darkest just before things go completely black” “I didn’t think the future was going to be this stupid” “I expected dystopia. I didn’t expect this stupidity.” “This is definitely the stupidest timeline.” If Trump saves Maxwell, he will destroy everything he promised The Hill I snort at that headline. Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht. Maxwell is nothing compared to that. Anyway, Maxwell is getting rehabilitated in the right wing media even as I type, from what I hear. Yep. they´ll sit it out. Which is why it´s called uni-party.

The text messages at the center of the Pfizergate scandal were exchanged in early 2021 during negotiations on the EU’s largest vaccine contract. Von der Leyen’s cell phone is said to have been “replaced several times” The New York Times has been demanding access to the text messages since 2022 and successfully sued the Commission for its refusal. However, in its new response dated July 28, the agency again refused to release them, as the newspaper now reports . According to the letter, von der Leyen’s Chief of Staff, Björn Seibert, read the messages on the Commission President’s mobile phone “in the summer of 2021” and decided not to store them in a way that would have made them publicly accessible. Seibert determined that the text messages were merely used to schedule phone calls during the pandemic. This decision was made shortly after journalist Alexander Fanta first requested access to the text messages in May 2021. According to the letter to the New York Times, the text messages have been missing since July 2023 at the latest. Von der Leyen’s phone was “replaced several times” without any data being transferred. Older devices were wiped and recycled, meaning the Commission can no longer recover the messages. At the heart of Pfizergate is the Commission’s lack of transparency regarding the EU’s largest vaccine contract. Key details regarding the negotiation process and financial terms have not been disclosed to date. Violation of EU transparency obligations Critics – including judges of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) – see the blocking of the SMS messages as a violation of the EU authority’s transparency obligations. In their May 2025 ruling, the judges emphasized that the Commission must “provide credible explanations that enable the public and the Court to understand why these documents cannot be found” – especially given the size of the largest EU treaty to date. The commission did not appeal the ruling, but instead developed a new legal argument to justify the renewed denial.

Title: Forecasts predict a dismal decade for stocks. Here's what to do.

Over the past several decades, the U.S. stock market has yielded average annual returns of around 10%. What if those days are over? In recent forecasts, Vanguard projects the stock market will rise by only 3.3% to 5.3% a year over the next decade. Morningstar sees U.S. stocks gaining 5.2% a year. Goldman Sachs forecasts the broad S&P 500 index will gain only 3% a year. Those numbers aren’t outliers. A roundup of market prognostications, charted by Morningstar, finds no one projecting annual returns higher than 6.7% for the domestic stock market in the next 10 years. In June, USA TODAY noted that many analysts predict the stock market will end the year with only meager gains. Some readers reacted with surprise, others with disbelief. Stock indexes have been posting record highs, despite lingering inflation, a softening job market and rising import tariffs. As it turns out, those record highs are one reason forecasters don’t expect much from the stock market over the rest of this year, nor in years to come. Here, then, is a closer look at why economists have dim hopes for the stock market in the next decade and what everyday investors can do about it. The simple reason forecasters don’t expect much from the U.S. stock market over the next decade: stock prices are already very high. Stock indexes have been breaking records. To analysts, that means many stocks are overpriced. Bargains are fewer. The indexes have less room to grow. Just how overpriced is the stock market? Economists have a yardstick to measure that. It’s called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE ratio. It measures a stock’s price against corporate earnings. It tells you, in effect, whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued. Right now, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 38.7. That means stock prices are very expensive, relative to earnings. “Right now, the U.S. stock market is trading at more than double the post-World War II average price-to-earnings ratio,” said Randy Bruns, a certified financial planner in Naperville, Illinois. There are two prior moments over the past century when the CAPE Ratio was really high. One was in 1929. The other was in 1999. In the decades that followed those peaks, the stock market sank like a stone: the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the dot-com bust and Great Recession of the 2000s. “Our projection is that that ratio is going to somehow come down,” said Paul Arnold, global head of multi-asset research at Morningstar. No one is forcing anyone to purchase expensive stocks. Why, then, do investors keep buying them? It’s easy to recite that old investing adage about buying low and selling high. It’s harder to follow the rule, especially when you don’t know how high is too high. Purchasing stocks when the market is high sounds like a flagrant violation of the buy-low rule. And yet, investment advisers routinely encourage consumers to keep buying stocks when prices are high. The reason: Stocks tend to rise over time. Even if you buy high, you can bet the market will eventually climb even higher. All those headlines about stock-market records function like ads for stocks. And investors keep buying them, pushing prices up. “When stocks are going up, investors have this tendency to think that now’s the time to get in,” said Todd Schlanger, senior investment strategist at Vanguard. “Stocks are one of the few things people don’t like to buy on sale.” Here’s another reason many forecasters are down on U.S. stocks, and especially the monster stocks known as the Magnificent Seven: Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla. Together, the Seven represent 34% of the overall value of the S&P 500, up from 12% in 2015, Motley Fool reports. That’s called market concentration, and it can be a bad thing. Investors are urged to diversify: not to hold only stocks, and not to hold too much of any one stock. The problem with the Magnificent Seven, Goldman Sachs reports, is that their massive growth is unsustainable: “It is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time.” Those seven stocks are “already priced to perfection,” Schlanger said. That’s a gentle way of saying that they are expensive. Vanguard forecasts that growth stocks, the category dominated by the Magnificent Seven, will grow by only 1.9% to 3.9% a year over the next decade. That does not mean the Magnificent Seven stocks are going to crash. “I find it hard to believe that something would happen that would throw one of those companies into a tailspin,” said Catherine Valega, a certified financial planner in Winchester, Massachusetts. “The larger companies have resources to pivot, if they need to.” Forecasters question, though, whether the Magnificent Seven will continue to grow at the same fevered pace of the past. “If those companies are booming, that’s great,” Bruns said. “But when the writing on the wall hits for those seven companies, it’ll be bad news for the S&P 500 as a whole.” If you want to avoid market concentration and overpriced stocks, forecasters say, here are some places to look:

Title: TCS layoffs: Is efficiency the new growth strategy?

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. On 27 June, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) made headlines when it announced plans to cut approximately 12,000 jobs, marking the largest layoff in the software services major’s history. The move sparked debate, with some industry observers interpreting it as fallout from artificial intelligence (AI), and warning of similar cuts at other major firms. However, TCS chief executive K. Krithivasan attributed the decision to skill mismatches, not AI. Days later, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said his company remained committed to hiring 20,000 freshers in FY26. The contrasting statements suggested that the layoffs were likely tied to TCS’s internal restructuring rather than indicative of an industry-wide trend. Still, the sector hasn’t resolved the structural challenges that have built up over the past few years. Investor confidence in IT stocks has eroded significantly from a year ago. While major companies have delivered strong returns over five years, their stock prices have declined over the past year—falling further in 2025 and trailing the BSE Sensex’s modest 3% year-to-date gain. Much of the market pessimism stems from softening demand in key Western markets, where clients are tightening budgets while AI capabilities expand. This has forced the industry to focus heavily on cost-cutting and efficiency improvements. Major IT players have dramatically reduced their workforce—TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra together employ 56,000 fewer people now than they did two years ago. Western pressuresSome of this drive comes from the sector’s peers in the West. A worldwide efficiency push has driven massive tech layoffs. According to Layoffs.fyi, tech companies eliminated over 80,000 positions in the first half of 2025 alone, following 152,000 cuts in 2024 and 264,000 in 2023. This restructuring wave, spearheaded by industry giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, has established new investor benchmarks for operational efficiency across the sector. But Indian IT services companies face a different challenge. They can't simply slash costs as product companies do, since revenue depends on billable hours. At the same time, their enterprise clients are reportedly demanding 20-30% price cuts, citing expected AI-driven productivity. Also Read | Three years on, AI is prompting IT companies to cut workforce The reality is more tempered. Parekh, for instance, recently told the Times of India that AI and automation are currently yielding productivity gains of only 5–15%. This mismatch between client expectations and actual impact is prompting firms to seek savings elsewhere. Client squeezePart of the efficiency drive is also rooted in sluggish demand. On TCS’s latest earnings call, Krithivasan observed that decision-making delays and project deferrals for discretionary investments had persisted and worsened through the June quarter. Workforce reductions over the past two years have enabled TCS and other tier-I firms to sustain or enhance revenue per employee, a critical performance metric for these companies. While leading IT services companies have stagnated, growth has been driven by global capability centres (the in-house tech hubs of multinational companies) and smaller players. GCC revenues expanded by 40% in FY24 alone. Nasscom projected earlier this year that revenues of GCCs in FY25 would roughly match IT service exports, with the total industry headcount growing by 126,000 to reach 5.8 million in FY25, up from 5.58 million in FY23. Efficiency driveIn effect, IT services majors that once powered the sector’s employment boom are now prioritizing profitability over headcount growth. Margins across leading firms have come under pressure, as pricing constraints and intensifying competition weigh on the sector. TCS, which has consistently reported the highest margins among peers, also made the boldest restructuring move—underscoring how central efficiency will be in the years ahead. Also Read | In charts: Sombre mood grips India’s top IT firms amid tariff tantrums The logic is clear: stronger margins enable more competitive pricing.

A worldwide efficiency push has driven massive tech layoffs. According to Layoffs.fyi, tech companies eliminated over 80,000 positions in the first half of 2025 alone, following 152,000 cuts in 2024 and 264,000 in 2023. This restructuring wave, spearheaded by industry giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, has established new investor benchmarks for operational efficiency across the sector. But Indian IT services companies face a different challenge. They can't simply slash costs as product companies do, since revenue depends on billable hours. At the same time, their enterprise clients are reportedly demanding 20-30% price cuts, citing expected AI-driven productivity. The reality is more tempered. Parekh, for instance, recently told the Times of India that AI and automation are currently yielding productivity gains of only 5–15%. This mismatch between client expectations and actual impact is prompting firms to seek savings elsewhere. Client squeezePart of the efficiency drive is also rooted in sluggish demand. On TCS’s latest earnings call, Krithivasan observed that decision-making delays and project deferrals for discretionary investments had persisted and worsened through the June quarter. Workforce reductions over the past two years have enabled TCS and other tier-I firms to sustain or enhance revenue per employee, a critical performance metric for these companies. While leading IT services companies have stagnated, growth has been driven by global capability centres (the in-house tech hubs of multinational companies) and smaller players. GCC revenues expanded by 40% in FY24 alone. Nasscom projected earlier this year that revenues of GCCs in FY25 would roughly match IT service exports, with the total industry headcount growing by 126,000 to reach 5.8 million in FY25, up from 5.58 million in FY23. Efficiency driveIn effect, IT services majors that once powered the sector’s employment boom are now prioritizing profitability over headcount growth.

Title: Will data centers crash the economy?
URL: https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy
Time Published: 2025-08-03T00:00:00Z

The U.S. economic data for the last few months is looking decidedly meh. The latest employment numbers were so bad that Trump actually fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing her of manipulating the numbers to make him look bad. But there’s one huge bright spot amid the gloom: an incredible AI data center building boom. AI technology is advancing fast, threatening (promising?) to upend many sectors of the economy. Nobody knows yet exactly who will profit from this boom, but one thing that’s certain is that it’s going to take a lot of computing power (or “compute”, as they say). AI models take a lot of compute to train, but nowadays they also take a lot of compute to do inference — i.e., to “think about” and answer each question you ask. Inference compute now represents most of the cost of running advanced AI models, and increases in inference compute are responsible for many of the ongoing performance gains. So compute needs are probably only going to grow as AI keeps getting better. Whoever provides this compute is going to make a huge amount of revenue. Whether that means they’ll make a lot of profit is another question, but let’s table that for right now; you can’t make profit if you don’t make revenue. So right now, tech companies have the choice to either sit out of the boom entirely, or spend big and hope they can figure out how to make a profit. Roughly speaking, Apple is choosing the former, while the big software companies — Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon — are choosing the latter. These spending numbers are pretty incredible: For Microsoft and Meta, this capital expenditure is now more than a third of their total sales. Here’s Chris Mims of the WSJ: The Magnificent 7 tech firms have collectively spent a record $102.5 billion on capex in their most recent quarters, nearly all from Meta, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft and Amazon. (Apple, Nvidia and Tesla together contributed a mere $6.7 billion.)… Investor and tech pundit Paul Kedrosky says that, as a percentage of gross domestic product, spending on AI infrastructure has already exceeded spending on telecom and internet infrastructure from the dot-com boom—and it’s still growing. He also argues that one explanation for the U.S. economy’s ongoing strength, despite tariffs, is that spending on IT infrastructure is so big that it’s acting as a sort of private-sector stimulus program… Capex spending for AI contributed more to growth in the U.S. economy in the past two quarters than all of consumer spending, says Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, citing data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. [emphasis mine] Here’s that chart from Kedrosky, who has been doing an excellent job following this story as it unfolds: Side note: I’m actually not sure Kedrosky is right about the height of the telecom boom. His chart shows the level of capex for 2020, when 5G and fiber infrastructure was being built out. But Doms (2004) shows U.S. telecom capex reaching $120 billion in 2000: That would have been around 1.2% of U.S. GDP at the time — about where the data center boom is now. But the data center boom is still ramping up, and there’s no obvious reason to think 2025 is the peak, so Kedrosky’s point still stands. I think it’s important to look at the telecom boom of the 1990s rather than the one in the 2010s, because the former led to a gigantic crash. The railroad boom led to a gigantic crash too, in 1873 (before the investment peak on Kedrosky’s chart). In both cases, companies built too much infrastructure, outrunning growth in demand for that infrastructure, and suffered a devastating bust as expectations reset and loans couldn’t be paid back. In both cases, though, the big capex spenders weren’t wrong, they were just early. Eventually, we ended up using all of those railroads and all of those telecom fibers, and much more. This has led a lot of people to speculate that big investment bubbles might actually be beneficial to the economy, since manias leave behind a surplus of cheap infrastructure that can be used to power future technological advances and new business models. But for anyone who gets caught up in the crash, the future benefits to society are of cold comfort. So a lot of people are worrying that there’s going to be a crash in the AI data center industry, and thus in Big Tech in general, if AI industry revenue doesn’t grow fast enough to keep up with the capex boom over the next few years.1 A data center bust would mean that Big Tech shareholders would lose a lot of money, like dot-com shareholders in 2000. It would also slow the economy directly, because Big Tech companies would stop investing. But the scariest possibility is that it would cause a financial crisis. Financial crises tend to involve bank debt. When a financial bubble and crash is mostly a fall in the value of stocks and bonds, everyone takes losses and then just sort of walks away, a bit poorer — like in 2000. Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2015) survey the history of bubbles and crashes, and they find that debt (also called “credit” and “leverage”) is a key predictor of whether a bubble ends up hurting the real economy. They write: Using a comprehensive dataset, covering a wide range of macroeconomic and financial variables, we demonstrate that it is the interaction of asset price bubbles and credit growth that poses the gravest risk to financial stability. These results, based on long-rung historical data, offer the first sound statistical support based on large samples for the widely held view that the financial stability risks stemming from of an unleveraged equity market boom gone bust (such as the U.S. dotcom bubble) can differ substantially from a credit-financed housing boom gone bust (such as the U.S. 2000s housing market). They use the terms “unleveraged” and “credit”, but what they really mean here — and the way they define their variable for credit growth — is specifically bank loans, not bonds. In the 2008 crash, most of the debt was held by banks, in one form or another. Thus, a wave of defaults threatened the solvency of the banking system, causing the entire economy to freeze up. But the banking system wasn’t in any real danger of collapse from the dot-com/telecom crash, because banks hadn’t lent a lot of money to people involved with the tech industry, so there weren’t a lot of loans to go bad. The telecom companies had borrowed a lot, but primarily via the bond markets rather than from banks, which at the time were more focused on housing and small business. Households also didn’t become significantly more indebted in the 90s (relative to their income), which is probably why there wasn’t a long and painful period of household deleveraging following the dotcom boom, the way there was after 2008. So if we believe this basic story of when to be afraid of capex busts, it means that we have to care about who is lending money to these Big Tech companies to build all these data centers. That way, we can figure out whether we’re worried about what happens to those lenders if Big Tech can’t pay the money back. Paul Kedrosky has a list: Where is all this capital coming from? For the most part, six sources: Internal Cash Flows (Primary for Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, etc. ) Debt Issuance (Rising role) Equity & Follow-on Offerings Venture Capital / Private Equity (CoreWeave, Lambda, etc.) SPVs, Leasing, and Asset-Backed Vehicles (like Meta's recent) Cloud Consumption Commitments (mostly hyperscalers) And The Economist writes: [C]apex is growing faster than [Big Tech’s] cashflows…The hot centre of the AI boom is moving from stockmarkets to debt markets…During the first half of the year investment-grade borrowing by tech firms was 70% higher than in the first six months of 2024. In April Alphabet issued bonds for the first time since 2020. Microsoft has reduced its cash pile but its finance leases—a type of debt mostly related to data centres—nearly tripled since 2023, to $46bn (a further $93bn of such liabilities are not yet on its balance-sheet). Meta is in talks to borrow around $30bn from private-credit lenders including Apollo, Brookfield and Carlyle. The market for debt securities backed by borrowing related to data centres, where liabilities are pooled and sliced up in a way similar to mortgage bonds, has grown from almost nothing in 2018 to around $50bn today… CoreWeave, an ai cloud firm, has borrowed liberally from private-credit funds and bond investors to buy chips from Nvidia. Fluidstack, another cloud-computing startup, is also borrowing heavily, using its chips as collateral. SoftBank, a Japanese firm, is financing its share of a giant partnership with Openai, the maker of ChatGPT, with debt. “They don’t actually have the money,” wrote Elon Musk when the partnership was announced in January. After raising $5bn of debt earlier this year xAI, Mr Musk’s own startup, is reportedly borrowing $12bn to buy chips. Some of these funding sources don’t seem that dangerous, in the macroeconomic sense. When Big Tech or other companies spend their own cash, issues stock, or issue bonds, it looks more like the telecom boom of the 1990s than the railroad boom of the 1800s. But what about all this “private credit”? These are the potentially scary part. Private credit funds are basically companies that take investment, borrow money, and then lend that money out in private (i.e. opaque) markets. They’re the debt version of private equity, and in recent years they’ve grown rapidly to become one of the U.S.’ economy’s major categories of debt: Private credit funds take some of their financing as equity, but they also borrow money. Some of this money is borrowed from banks. In 2013, only 1% of U.S. banks’ total loans to non-bank financial institutions was to private equity and private credit firms; today, it’s 14%. A recent note by Berrospide et al. of the Federal Reserve shows the rise in bank lending to private credit: BDCs are “Business Development Companies”, which are a type of private credit fund. If there’s a bust in private credit, that’s an acronym you’ll be hearing a lot. And I believe the graph above does not include bank purchases of bonds (CLOs) issued by private credit companies. If private credit goes bust, those bank assets will go bust too, making banks’ balance sheets weaker. A recent article by Fillat et al. of the Boston Fed argues that bank lending to private credit funds might pose a systemic risk to the banking system: The meteoric rise of private credit presents important questions about the role of banks going forward and the implications for stability in the US financial system…Our analysis of Federal Reserve and proprietary loan-level data indicates that the growth of private credit has been funded largely by bank loans and that banks have become a key source of liquidity, in the form of credit lines, for PC lenders. Banks’ extensive links to the PC market could be a concern because those links indirectly expose banks to the traditionally higher risks associated with PC loans. The authors point out that most of these are very short-term loans — hence safer than long-term loans like the ones that sunk banks in the financial crisis of 2008. And most of them are senior loans — if private credit goes bust, banks get paid out first. But they caution: [B]anks would suffer losses [on their private credit lending] only in severely adverse economic conditions, such as a deep and protracted recession. But losses could also occur in a less adverse scenario if the default correlation among the loans in PC portfolios turned out to be higher than anticipated—that is, if a larger-than-expected number of PC borrowers defaulted at the same time. Such tail risk may be underappreciated. If all the private credit funds are lending to data centers, then their correlations are probably pretty high — if there’s a bust in AI, a lot of them will go bust at once. This could be the “tail risk” that the Boston Fed folks are worried about, and it seems like there’s a chance it could hurt the U.S. banking system. A private credit bust also could hurt insurance companies, who are the main LPs in the funds, but who also lend money to the funds. For example, Carlino et al. (2025) show how life insurers have basically become a kind of bank that borrows money from institutional investors and lends it to private credit: They note, ominously, that “life insurers' exposure to below-investment-grade firm debt has boomed and now exceeds the industry's exposure to subprime residential mortgage-backed securities in late 2007.” I’m not exactly sure how systemically important life insurance companies are; they’re intertwined with the rest of the financial system through a number of channels, and it’s hard to tell how significant those challenges are. But it seems like the possibility is there for some systemic effects. Meanwhile, other types of insurers are starting to lend to private credit as well. Remember that AIG, an insurance company, was one of the most important bailouts in the financial crisis of 2008. So when I look at this entire landscape, it seems to me that some of the basic conditions of a financial crisis are at least starting to fall into place: We have a big story about why “this time is different” — the idea that AI will change everything, and that data centers will thus earn huge returns. We have a large and increasing amount of debt being used to fund one single sector of the economy (data centers), meaning that the loans’ default probability is probably highly correlated. We have an opaque corner of the financial system (private credit) that has recently grown from a tiny piece of the system to a very significant piece. We have systemically important lenders (banks, and possibly insurance companies) enmeshed in the new sector in a multitude of ways. So far, the danger doesn’t scream “2008”. But if you wait until 2008 to start worrying, you’re going to get 2008. It’s good to start worrying early. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, is not waiting to start sounding the alarm, warning that private credit could trigger the next financial crisis, even as his own company expands into the private credit market. As a former Citibank CEO said after 2008, “As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance.” Share Some people also worry that the U.S. power grid won’t be big and reliable enough to handle the new power demands from all these data centers. With Trump continuing his all-out attack on solar and wind energy, this is a real concern. I was expecting your next post to be about the BLS and how we can be expecting record grain harvests this year… Dumb questions alert... Why do “Business Development Companies” exist ? Why don't businesses just get their loans from banks ? I'll guess it's because BDC's will make loans that Banks won't? But if that's it, why do banks make loans to companies that make loans that by the bank's standards are too risky ? No posts Ready for more?

Title: Takeaways From Berkshire Hathaway’s Second Quarter 2025 Earnings
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/08/02/takeaways-from-berkshire-hathaways-second-quarter-2025-earnings/
Time Published: 2025-08-02T19:53:07Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) reported second-quarter earnings of almost $12.4 billion, well below the $30.3 billion in the same quarter of 2024, primarily due to a decline in stocks. Operating earnings, which remove the distortion from market changes and better reflect the firm’s earnings power, fell by 4% for the quarter versus 2024. Per-share operating income decreased by 4% for the quarter, with no share repurchases over the past year. Warren Buffett leads Berkshire as CEO and Chairman with Greg Abel, Vice Chairman of Non-insurance, and Ajit Jain, Vice Chairman of Insurance. Berkshire announced an impairment to its investment in Kraft Heinz (KHC). The investment had been carried on Berkshire’s books for more than its market value for some time, but some changes in circumstances caused the firm to take a pretax impairment loss of around $5.0 billion. This writedown is a non-cash charge, which reduces the “carrying value of our investment in Kraft Heinz to fair value.” Buffett has long acknowledged that he paid too much for Kraft Heinz, especially in light of the increased competition in the branded food category. Berkshire’s most significant business by operating earnings is insurance, followed by the manufacturing, service, and retailing segment. Insurance underwriting was the primary culprit behind the decline in operating earnings. Buffett noted at the annual meeting that Berkshire’s insurance earnings were as good as they get in 2024, so doing less well this year is unsurprising. Other income also declined significantly, primarily due to accounting for foreign currency swings. Excluding insurance and the “other” segment, operating earnings were 13% higher. The two most essential concepts in insurance investing are “float” and underwriting profit. In simple terms, float is created for insurance companies because insurance premiums are paid before any claims are made by the insured. Insurance companies can invest the float, sometimes for years, before insurance losses are reimbursed. Berkshire’s float at $174 billion is $3 billion higher than on December 31, 2024. In general, the value of float increases as yields rise since an insurance company can earn more when investing the cash. Float per share was $120,983, above the level at the end of 2024. Share repurchases were not an aid to the growth of float per share over the past year. The underwriting profit comparison versus the second quarter of 2024 was challenging, as Berkshire had achieved stellar insurance earnings last year. Notably, policies in force at GEICO grew in the second quarter. Berkshire has a history, unlike many insurance companies, of earning an underwriting profit, meaning that their float costs nothing and makes money in addition to allowing Berkshire to earn a profit from investing the float. Berkshire has three main insurance businesses: GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. All three had a profitable underwriting quarter. An underwriting profit means the insurance premium exceeds all insurance claims and expenses. For example, GEICO had a combined ratio of 83.5% in the second quarter, which means that only 83.5 cents of every dollar in insurance premiums were spent on losses and expenses. A combined ratio over 100% indicates the insurance company has an underwriting loss. For the second quarter of 2025, investment income was 1% higher than in 2024, primarily due to lower taxes. Notably, policies in force grew relative to the first quarter of 2024. Berkshire owns one of the largest railroads in North America, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad, which operates in the US and Canada. Railroad freight volume improved modestly, and operating earnings rose about 19% versus the same quarter last year. On a positive note, BNSF continued to see better productivity, which was the primary reason for the sharp rise in earnings. BNSF’s trailing 12-month operating ratio, operating expenses divided by revenue, improved in the second quarter, which is proof of the productivity improvement. Buffett noted at the annual meeting that the “railroad is not earning what it should,” but is” getting solved,” and the recent progress in reducing operating expenses supports his statement. BHE generally provides steady and growing earnings, as one would expect from what primarily consists of regulated utilities and pipeline companies. In addition, BHE typically produces significant tax credits due to its renewable electricity generation. For this reason, Berkshire focuses on after-tax earnings, which is “how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated.” BHE was modestly negative on the headline numbers, with operating earnings falling by 2.6% over the same quarter in 2024. The lack of wildfire loss accruals in the second quarter of 2025 for the US utilities segment flattered the year-over-year comparisons. In the second quarter of 2024, BHE’s US utilities group accrued $251 million for possible wildfire litigation losses. The decrease in earnings from the natural gas pipelines was primarily caused by higher interest expense, decreased margin, and lower other income. The other energy businesses saw a reduction in earnings, primarily from lower profits at Northern Powergrid. Pretax earnings rose by 4.7%. This segment consists of many diverse companies, so this analysis will focus on the best and worst performers and some themes when looking at this segment. Within the industrial segment, Marmon, “which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into twelve groups, and includes equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries,” saw a 6.9% increase in pretax earnings. The improvement was primarily due to “reductions of liabilities accrued in connection with a prior business acquisition,” with operating results in the twelve groups mixed. Elsewhere in the manufacturing segment, the building and consumer products groups accounted for the decline in pretax income. Within building products, Clayton Homes had better revenues, but lower pretax income due to “lower earnings from financial services.” Berkshire noted that their “building products businesses are experiencing slowing customer demand and pricing pressures, attributable to prevailing general economic conditions and housing markets. The decline in consumer products earnings was primarily from Forest River, Garan, Jazwares, and Duracell. Brooks Sports and Fruit of the Loom had better earnings. The service group saw a 15.2% increase in pretax earnings for the quarter, primarily attributable to the aviation services, TTI, leasing businesses, and Charter Brokerage. The retailing group saw a turnaround in earnings growth, with a 11.9% increase in pretax earnings for the quarter. The most critical portion of the retailing segment is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (BHA), which owns over 80 auto dealerships. BHA had 8% higher earnings compared to the second quarter of 2024. Pretax profits for the remainder of the retailing group rose by 23.9%, due primarily to “higher earnings from Nebraska Furniture Mart and seasonality effects at See’s Candies.” Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) is the largest operator of travel centers in North America, under the names Pilot and Flying J. On January 16, 2024, Berkshire acquired the final 20% and now owns 100% of the entity. PTC’s pretax earnings decreased 40.2% due to “lower gross sales margins and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.” McLane’s pretax earnings were 23.9% higher thanks to “an increase in the overall gross sales margin rate, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses.” This segment includes companies’ profits that must be accounted for under the equity method due to the size of ownership and influence on management. The after-tax equity method earnings have Berkshire’s proportionate share of profits attributable to its investments in Kraft Heinz (KHC), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and Berkadia. Berkshire is Occidental Petroleum’s largest shareholder, with a 28.1% stake. More about the reasons for the Occidental investment is here. The segment experienced a 97% decline in operating earnings for the quarter, primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate losses generated from bonds issued by Berkshire Hathaway and denominated in British Pounds, euros, and Japanese Yen. These foreign currency swings are not a concern as Berkshire has significant assets and earnings denominated in these foreign currencies. Investment gains from non-U.S. dollar investments generally offset some of these losses and vice versa, depending on currency exchange rates. Acquisition accounting expenses are also reflected in this segment. These expenses are created by amortizing intangible assets connected to companies purchased by Berkshire. Finally, the gain in other earnings includes “Berkshire parent company investment income, corporate expenses, intercompany interest income on loans to operating subsidiaries when the related interest expense is included in earnings of the operating subsidiaries and unallocated income taxes.” Berkshire’s insurance company investment portfolio is currently 52% publicly traded stocks, with 44% in cash. Berkshire was a net seller of $3 billion in publicly traded stocks in the second quarter, the eleventh straight quarter of Berkshire Hathaway’s net sales of stocks. Berkshire bought $3.9 billion of stocks while selling $6.9 billion. The upcoming 13F filing on August 14 with the SEC will provide more specific buy and sell details, but some clues within the current filing point to more sales of Bank of America (BAC) and Apple (AAPL). Summary And Scorecard Berkshire’s stock price outperformed the S&P 500 in the first quarter, falling by 8.8% versus a total return of +10.9% from the S&P 500. Year-to-date through August 1, Berkshire’s price was +4.3%, while the S&P 500 had a total return of +6.9%. Short-term results are generally not meaningful for Berkshire since it is managed with a focus on increasing long-term value and not meeting quarterly hurdles. This ability to take advantage of time arbitrage has served the company and shareholders well over the years. The goal in looking at the results is to see if the segments are generally operating as expected and to consider Warren Buffett's capital allocation decisions. Previously, Buffett provided a handy blueprint for the goals of Berkshire’s management. The first goal would be to “increase operating earnings.” Secondly, success in the “decrease shares outstanding” goal would boost operating earnings per share faster. Lastly, “hope for an occasional big opportunity,” allowing for a sizable cash investment at an attractive expected return. This analysis will use Buffett’s blueprint as a lens through which to evaluate how Berkshire is performing. Increase operating earnings: Trailing 12-month operating earnings were 8.0% higher than last year’s same quarter. Buffett says that operating earnings are the “most descriptive” way to view Berkshire since they remove the short-term volatility of market fluctuations in net earnings. Decrease shares outstanding: Particularly since 2018, a significant capital allocation decision has been made to increase share repurchases. When Berkshire Hathaway actively repurchases shares, it signals when Buffett believes its share price is below his intrinsic value estimate. If he is correct, the purchases are a value-creator for the remaining shareholders. Berkshire has stated that there would be no stock repurchases if it would cause cash levels to fall below $30 billion, so the firm’s safety will not be compromised. Berkshire has not repurchased stock for the last five quarters. Until an announcement in mid-2018, Berkshire had only made repurchases when the stock traded at less than 1.2 times the price-to-book (P/B) ratio. While that constraint is now relaxed, it is still a good indicator of the general range when aggressive repurchases will likely be seen. Berkshire’s price-to-book ratio remained elevated during the quarter, so share repurchases were suspended. Berkshire only intends to repurchase shares when the “repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined.” The price-to-book ratio remains a reasonable proxy for gauging Berkshire’s intrinsic value. The stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2024 were likely done at around 1.4-1.5 times book value. Berkshire’s stock reached almost 1.8 times book in May 2025, so a lack of repurchases in the quarter wasn’t unexpected. With the recent decline in the shares, the valuation is nearing a level where repurchases might restart. Still, Warren Buffett’s judgment about its intrinsic value versus other available uses of capital can differ from the simple price-to-book measure. A longer-term view of the positive impact of Berkshire’s share repurchases is illuminating. Since the start of more aggressive share repurchases in 2018, Berkshire’s operating earnings have grown at a 16.5% compound growth rate, while operating earnings per share have done 2.1 percentage points better at 18.6%. Eagle-eyed readers might notice that operating earnings growth oddly exceeded operating earnings per share growth over the last year. Berkshire issued some shares to purchase the remainder of Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE) in October 2024. Hope for an occasional big opportunity: Berkshire has a fortress balance sheet with cash and equivalents of over $339 billion. Cash as a percentage of Berkshire Hathaway’s size is close to the highest on record, at 29.6%. This cash hoard provides flexibility to take advantage of opportunities, including repurchasing its stock if the price declines to attractive levels. Share repurchases had been off the table at the elevated valuations, but an additional lever for Buffett to create value might soon return. Shareholders should take comfort in knowing that the firm is well-positioned to withstand and emerge stronger from any tariff shocks, recession, or market downturn, thanks to its financial resilience, which enables it to capitalize on opportunities during a crisis. Buffett announced at the end of the annual meeting in May that he planned to step down from the CEO role at the end of the year. Greg Abel will assume the CEO role and have the “final word on operations or capital deployment.” Notably, Buffett will remain Chairman to provide any needed guidance and intends to retain all his shares in the company. Some are attributing the relative weakness in Berkshire’s share price to Buffett’s announcement of leaving the CEO role, but the proximate cause likely lies elsewhere. Investors flocked to Berkshire stock as a haven when the odds of recession soared with the tariff threat. As the fear of recession receded, some investors re-allocated to other stocks, and Berkshire’s valuation had become stretched in May. While Berkshire’s quarterly operating earnings were down modestly year-over-year, there were some pleasant surprises in the data. Excluding insurance and the other segment, which is heavily impacted by foreign exchange volatility, operating profits grew 13% year-over-year. The BNSF railroad made significant progress in improving productivity to drive higher profits. The manufacturing, service, and retailing segment was surprisingly resilient with 12% year-over-year operating earnings growth. Lastly, one of Berkshire’s crown jewels, GEICO, seems to be back in profitable growth mode with policies in force continuing to rise. Disclosure: Bill Stone a long-time shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway and worked for Salomon Brothers when Warren Buffett became Chairman and CEO. Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and other companies mentioned within its recommended investment strategies.

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Bullish about stocks for the rest of 2025? You’re not alone. Even as the August 1 start date for higher tariffs has arrived, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite are trending up and flirting with new highs. Plus, analysts from Oppenheimer Asset Management, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and RBC Capital Markets have raised their 2025 S&P 500 targets. When market optimism is high, growth stocks can pad your wealth quickly. Let's meet six top growth stocks that deserve a closer look. The best growth stocks to buy for August are S&P 500 constituents that meet these criteria: The resulting stock list was ordered from highest to lowest EPS growth expectation, and the top six were chosen for inclusion. The table below identifies six growth stocks that fit the parameters noted above. Two of these stocks are also featured in: best stocks for 2025. A review of each company follows. Metrics are sourced from company reports and stockanalysis.com, unless noted otherwise. Howmet Aerospace by the numbers: Howmet Aerospace provides jet engine components, fastening systems and structural components for aerospace and defense applications. The company also serves the commercial transportation industry with forged aluminum wheels. HWM stock is up 72.1% for the year, thanks to strong earnings and an upbeat outlook for 2025. Howmet specializes in parts that support lightweight, fuel-efficient designs for aircraft and commercial trucks. This is an advantage in the current environment. Airline manufacturing activity has been light in recent years and fleets are aging. As a result, demand is growing for low-maintenance, fuel-efficient aircraft. Howmet is relying on efficient operational execution to leverage the strong demand for its technology. This shows up in the financial statements as higher adjusted operating income margin and free cash flow. Some excess cash remains on the balance sheet, and some was used for debt repayment. Improved liquidity and lower debt have strengthened Howmet’s financial position. Fitch recently confirmed this by raising the company's long-term issuer default rating from BBB to BBB+. After delivering a 46% increase to adjusted EPS in 2024, Howmet expects a 26.4% gain in 2025. Nvidia by the numbers: Nvidia designs high-powered GPUs and related hardware and software. The company earns most of its revenue from data center infrastructure products, including AI-capable GPUs. Since 2024, Nvidia has been the dominant market-share leader in the high-growth AI chips segment. NVDA stock is up 31.6% for the year and 1,601.8% over the past five years. Now the world’s most valuable company, Nvidia has been delivering impressive quarter-over-quarter revenue gains since the second quarter of fiscal 2024—when AI chip demand began to skyrocket. Nvidia’s market position, client list and technological prowess put the company in a class by itself. While anything's possible, it's hard to imagine a competitor taking a meaningful share of Nvidia's business. That’s an enviable position because the demand outlook for AI infrastructure remains quite strong. Citigroup analyst Atif Malik recently projected the 2028 total addressable market for AI chips to reach $563 billion, up 13% from a prior outlook. And Google parent Alphabet has said it will invest $75 billion in its data centers this year. For the quarter ended in April 2025, Nvidia reported 69% revenue growth and 33% non-GAAP diluted EPS growth versus the prior-year quarter. Motorola Solutions by the numbers: Motorola provides video security, land mobile radio communication and command center solutions and technology. Most of the company's revenue, 70%, comes from public safety customers, including police forces and 911 centers. The remaining 30% is split among enterprise customers in various industries, including utilities, hospitality, manufacturing and retail. MSI stock is down 7.4% this year after two positive earnings surprises. Investors may have been put off by the company’s conservative guidance for 2025's first and second quarters. A lower-growth expectation for two quarters isn’t a dealbreaker for MSI because there are other things to like about this company: In the quarter ending May 1, 2025, MSI delivered 6% revenue growth and 13% non-GAAP EPS growth compared to the prior-year quarter. Amazon by the numbers: Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce retailer and the global market-share leader in cloud computing services. E-commerce delivers most of Amazon's revenue, but the higher-margin AWS cloud computing business provides higher operating income. AMZN stock is up 6.1% for the year after recovering from a dip from March through May. Over the past 12 months, AMZN has gained 28%. Amazon’s diversified business model has delivered revenue growth for years. Diluted EPS has been less consistent, but the 2024 result of $5.53 versus $2.90 in the prior year did make a statement. Based on announcements made in Amazon’s first quarter report, the company is firing on multiple cylinders. It's using AI to enhance the Amazon.com shopping experience as it expands the product set and geographic reach. The company is also growing its entertainment business and audience, with successful launches of Reacher Season 3 and LeBron James' Mind the Game podcast. And AWS is broadening its AI and computing capabilities as it secures new contract wins with premier customers like Adobe and Nasdaq. In the quarter ending on May 1, Amazon increased net revenue 9% and diluted 47.5% compared to the year-ago quarter. Mastercard Incorporated by the numbers: Mastercard processes digital payments in the U.S. and internationally. The per-transaction revenue model creates gains when spending across the Mastercard network increases or prices rise. Mastercard also has a growing services business encompassing security, marketing and other value-added services. MA stock is up 7.9% this year after two positive earnings surprises. Mastercard has the second-largest market share in U.S. credit card processing after Visa. According to Capital One Shopping, consumers charged $2.78 trillion to their Mastercards in 2024. Looking ahead, the outlook for consumer spending for 2025 is mixed, with some analysts predicting a slowdown in the second half. So far, Mastercard’s results show no signs of a spending slowdown. The company's last earnings report noted higher gross dollar volume and higher cross-border volume. Mastercard has also made strides diversifying its business model with initiatives like: Mastercard’s high operating margin in the upper 50s provides flexibility to pursue these and other growth initiatives. For the quarter ending on May 1, Mastercard reported constant-currency revenue and EPS growth of 17% and 15%, respectively. Disclosure: Author owns Microsoft stock. Microsoft by the numbers: Microsoft develops and maintains productivity software, sells cloud computing services and provides gaming hardware and content. MSFT stock is up 21.6% for the year after two positive earnings surprises and several analyst price target increases. Microsoft is the number two player in the cloud computing space, behind Amazon’s AWS. Modern platforms provide the environment for AI application development, training and deployment—so this high-margin space benefits directly from the AI revolution. It’s not surprising that Microsoft's ongoing investments in its cloud and AI offerings are driving profitable growth and substantial operating cash flow. The cash performance continues to provide the tech company with ample funding for growth initiatives and its modest dividend yield of 0.65%. (For higher-yielding dividend-payers, see best dividend stocks.) For the quarter ending on March 31, Microsoft reported constant-currency revenue and diluted EPS growth of 15% and 19%, respectively. Bottom Line High-flying growth stocks can produce quick gains in your portfolio—if you time things right. But because the stock market always has surprises on tap, make sure you're diversified and prepared financially for long holding periods. If you need help diversifying, see this list of best ETFs for 2025.

The table below identifies six growth stocks that fit the parameters noted above. Two of these stocks are also featured in: best stocks for 2025. A review of each company follows. Metrics are sourced from company reports and stockanalysis.com, unless noted otherwise. Howmet Aerospace by the numbers: Howmet Aerospace provides jet engine components, fastening systems and structural components for aerospace and defense applications. The company also serves the commercial transportation industry with forged aluminum wheels. HWM stock is up 72.1% for the year, thanks to strong earnings and an upbeat outlook for 2025. Howmet specializes in parts that support lightweight, fuel-efficient designs for aircraft and commercial trucks. This is an advantage in the current environment. Airline manufacturing activity has been light in recent years and fleets are aging. As a result, demand is growing for low-maintenance, fuel-efficient aircraft. Howmet is relying on efficient operational execution to leverage the strong demand for its technology. This shows up in the financial statements as higher adjusted operating income margin and free cash flow. Some excess cash remains on the balance sheet, and some was used for debt repayment. Improved liquidity and lower debt have strengthened Howmet’s financial position. Fitch recently confirmed this by raising the company's long-term issuer default rating from BBB to BBB+. After delivering a 46% increase to adjusted EPS in 2024, Howmet expects a 26.4% gain in 2025. Nvidia by the numbers: Nvidia designs high-powered GPUs and related hardware and software. The company earns most of its revenue from data center infrastructure products, including AI-capable GPUs. Since 2024, Nvidia has been the dominant market-share leader in the high-growth AI chips segment. NVDA stock is up 31.6% for the year and 1,601.8% over the past five years. Now the world’s most valuable company, Nvidia has been delivering impressive quarter-over-quarter revenue gains since the second quarter of fiscal 2024—when AI chip demand began to skyrocket. Nvidia’s market position, client list and technological prowess put the company in a class by itself. While anything's possible, it's hard to imagine a competitor taking a meaningful share of Nvidia's business. That’s an enviable position because the demand outlook for AI infrastructure remains quite strong. Citigroup analyst Atif Malik recently projected the 2028 total addressable market for AI chips to reach $563 billion, up 13% from a prior outlook. And Google parent Alphabet has said it will invest $75 billion in its data centers this year. For the quarter ended in April 2025, Nvidia reported 69% revenue growth and 33% non-GAAP diluted EPS growth versus the prior-year quarter. Motorola Solutions by the numbers: Motorola provides video security, land mobile radio communication and command center solutions and technology. Most of the company's revenue, 70%, comes from public safety customers, including police forces and 911 centers. The remaining 30% is split among enterprise customers in various industries, including utilities, hospitality, manufacturing and retail. MSI stock is down 7.4% this year after two positive earnings surprises. Investors may have been put off by the company’s conservative guidance for 2025's first and second quarters. A lower-growth expectation for two quarters isn’t a dealbreaker for MSI because there are other things to like about this company: In the quarter ending May 1, 2025, MSI delivered 6% revenue growth and 13% non-GAAP EPS growth compared to the prior-year quarter. Amazon by the numbers: Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce retailer and the global market-share leader in cloud computing services. E-commerce delivers most of Amazon's revenue, but the higher-margin AWS cloud computing business provides higher operating income. AMZN stock is up 6.1% for the year after recovering from a dip from March through May. Over the past 12 months, AMZN has gained 28%. Amazon’s diversified business model has delivered revenue growth for years. Diluted EPS has been less consistent, but the 2024 result of $5.53 versus $2.90 in the prior year did make a statement. Based on announcements made in Amazon’s first quarter report, the company is firing on multiple cylinders. It's using AI to enhance the Amazon.com shopping experience as it expands the product set and geographic reach. The company is also growing its entertainment business and audience, with successful launches of Reacher Season 3 and LeBron James' Mind the Game podcast. And AWS is broadening its AI and computing capabilities as it secures new contract wins with premier customers like Adobe and Nasdaq. In the quarter ending on May 1, Amazon increased net revenue 9% and diluted 47.5% compared to the year-ago quarter. Mastercard Incorporated by the numbers: Mastercard processes digital payments in the U.S. and internationally. The per-transaction revenue model creates gains when spending across the Mastercard network increases or prices rise. Mastercard also has a growing services business encompassing security, marketing and other value-added services. MA stock is up 7.9% this year after two positive earnings surprises. Mastercard has the second-largest market share in U.S. credit card processing after Visa. According to Capital One Shopping, consumers charged $2.78 trillion to their Mastercards in 2024. Looking ahead, the outlook for consumer spending for 2025 is mixed, with some analysts predicting a slowdown in the second half. So far, Mastercard’s results show no signs of a spending slowdown. The company's last earnings report noted higher gross dollar volume and higher cross-border volume. Mastercard has also made strides diversifying its business model with initiatives like: Mastercard’s high operating margin in the upper 50s provides flexibility to pursue these and other growth initiatives. For the quarter ending on May 1, Mastercard reported constant-currency revenue and EPS growth of 17% and 15%, respectively. Disclosure: Author owns Microsoft stock. Microsoft by the numbers: Microsoft develops and maintains productivity software, sells cloud computing services and provides gaming hardware and content. MSFT stock is up 21.6% for the year after two positive earnings surprises and several analyst price target increases. Microsoft is the number two player in the cloud computing space, behind Amazon’s AWS. Modern platforms provide the environment for AI application development, training and deployment—so this high-margin space benefits directly from the AI revolution. It’s not surprising that Microsoft's ongoing investments in its cloud and AI offerings are driving profitable growth and substantial operating cash flow. The cash performance continues to provide the tech company with ample funding for growth initiatives and its modest dividend yield of 0.65%. (For higher-yielding dividend-payers, see best dividend stocks.) For the quarter ending on March 31, Microsoft reported constant-currency revenue and diluted EPS growth of 15% and 19%, respectively. Bottom Line High-flying growth stocks can produce quick gains in your portfolio—if you time things right. But because the stock market always has surprises on tap, make sure you're diversified and prepared financially for long holding periods. If you need help diversifying, see this list of best ETFs for 2025.

Title: New tariffs, alarming job numbers and a high-profile firing: A wild week for the Trump economy

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Tariffs putting the squeeze on businesses and consumers while bringing in billions of dollars for the United States government. A job market that is showing major signs of cracking even as the unemployment rate remains subdued. Tech stocks surging on Wall Street, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom — as many other sectors are ailing. As Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on social media earlier this week: “the Trump economy has officially arrived.” The past week was already primed to be a doozy for data, with investors and analysts eagerly anticipating updates about economic growth, jobs and the Fed’s latest interest rate decision. Major companies like Apple, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft reported their latest financial results. Trump’s deadline for trade deals was set for Friday. But what happened this week turned out to be more extraordinary than anyone expected. “I’m sending off red flares: We’re on the precipice of a recession,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, a financial research company. “If tariffs keep increasing, I don’t know how we avoid a recession.” Coming into this week, the U.S. economy had generally been considered in good shape despite mounting uncertainty and concerns about slowing growth. The week kicked off in Scotland with the announcement of a deal with the European Union that would set tariffs at 15%, ending months of uncertainty surrounding the United States’ largest trade partner. Trade talks then moved to Sweden, where leading officials from the U.S. and China held two days of negotiations. The talks yielded neither a deal nor a formal extension of the two countries’ trade truce, which will expire Aug. 12. “The meetings were very constructive,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters after the talks wrapped up. “It’s just that we haven’t given the sign-off.” Given the importance of trade relations between the world’s two largest economies, the cliffhanger meant the cloud of uncertainty created by Trump’s tariffs gambit persisted, despite some deals having been struck with other major trading partners including the European Union and Japan. Tuesday offered little reason for renewed optimism, with the international shipping giant UPS again declining to issue financial forecasts for the rest of the year, prompting investor concern about the impact of Trump’s shifting trade war and causing company shares to tank. Wednesday began with the Commerce Department reporting figures for second-quarter gross domestic product, or GDP, which measures economic growth in the U.S. The data showed an annual gain of 3%, beating expectations. But the same report also contained worrisome signs about business investment, even as price growth was accelerating. Later that day, the Federal Reserve announced it was keeping its benchmark interest rate unchanged, in part due to those inflation concerns. That drew the ire of Trump, who has spent weeks hounding Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower the key lending rate. In remarks following the central bank’s announcement, Powell pointed to ongoing concerns about the potential for Trump’s tariffs to raise prices for U.S. consumers — but critically, referred to the jobs market as “solid.” Notably, two members of the rate-setting board — both appointed by Trump — dissented, the first time that has occurred in more than three decades. Blowout earnings from Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta — two companies at the center of the AI investment boom, which is a key part of Trump’s domestic agenda — helped the stock market reach fresh highs early Thursday. Microsoft briefly became the second company to be worth more than $4 trillion on the stock market. Yet by the time the markets closed that day, stocks had erased their gains after Trump sent letters to more than a dozen pharmaceutical companies demanding they offer U.S. customers more competitive pricing for new medicines and giving them 60 days to comply. Late Thursday evening, Trump unveiled a sweeping new set of tariffs that unilaterally imposed higher import taxes on a host of trading partners, including allies like Canada and Taiwan. The new effective rate of more than 15% delivered a shock to global markets. The month closed with the Treasury Department reporting monthly tariff collections had hit another new record of more than $29 billion. In an interview with NBC News that evening, Trump touted the expansive new tariffs, saying he believed it all was going “very well, very smooth,” even as he remained open to new deals. Then Friday’s jobs report arrived. At 8:30 a.m., the Bureau of Labor Statistics published revisions showing sharply lower jobs totals for May and June than initially reported, while also finding the economy had added just 73,000 jobs in July, far below expectations. All told, it suggested the U.S. has gained an average of just 35,000 jobs a month over the past three months — and excluding the increases seen in the health care industry, the U.S. had lost more jobs than it had created. The unemployment rate, however, remained at 4.2%, a sign that overall joblessness remains subdued. However, many economists noted the data point is largely attributable to the president’s immigration crackdown, which is shrinking the overall labor force. The White House hailed the loss of foreign-born workers as it also noted a more sustained increase in the labor force among native-born workers. “If we’re swapping out foreign-born job holders for American-born job holders, I think that’s a win,” White House chief economic adviser Stephen Miran told Axios. He added that there was “really good reason” to believe the economy would improve, citing Trump’s trade deals and tax cuts. But for Trump, the public’s larger takeaway of a weakening labor market prompted an unprecedented response: Shortly after 2 p.m. ET on Friday, the president announced his intention to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics over what he said were errors in the jobs data, as well as accusations the agency had “manipulated” the numbers prior to the 2024 election. Neither allegation has been corroborated. The move sent shockwaves through Washington, with some experts warning it risked lowering the U.S. to the level of authoritarian regimes. “President Trump is once again destroying the credibility of our government by firing expert and nonpartisan officials because he does not like the facts that they present,” said Max Stier, the CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service. “Governments that go down this path find themselves in ugly territory very quickly.” It was not clear whether the outgoing BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, a Biden administration appointee, would seek to challenge her removal in court. As it turns out, in addition to nominating a new head of the critical data agency, Trump will also get to name a new member to the Fed’s rate-setting board after Adriana Kugler, another Joe Biden appointee, unexpectedly announced her resignation late Friday. Both nominees still must be confirmed by the Senate, which remains narrowly controlled by the GOP. Asked if the White House continued to harbor concerns about the direction of the economy, Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, issued the following statement: “In his first term, President Trump used an America First economic agenda to deliver historic working class prosperity and the first reduction in wealth and income inequality in decades. In his [second] term, President Trump is implementing the very same policy mix of deregulation, fairer trade, and pro-growth tax cuts at an even bigger scale — as these policies take effect, the best is yet to come.” That view is not shared among other economists. “All of this is troubling: a weakening economy, slowing labor market, rising inflation, rising tariffs, political influence on a statistical agency, more political influence on Fed, tensions with Russia & the onset of a market correction,” EY Parthenon chief economist Greg Daco wrote on X.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 02 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 02 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies.

Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session.

The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 02 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks.

Title: I left my job in tech and moved to Spain. Being alone in a foreign country is hard, but it's changed me for the better.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/left-tech-moved-from-austin-texas-to-barcelona-spain-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-02T10:23:01Z
Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Parrie Hartley, 30, who moved from Austin to Barcelona in February 2025. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. I'm from a really small town outside of Houston, where there are not a lot of employment opportunities. I've always been a city girl at heart, so in 2020, after a brief stint living in Australia, I moved to Austin and started working in software sales. Austin's tech scene is booming. Many, like big corporations, like Amazon, Tesla, and Meta, have opened offices there, bringing with them a lot of jobs. Moving there definitely built my career and made me a lot of money. Living in the city was awesome, too. It's a great place for young people, with an amazing culture, food, and music scene. There are a lot of events, and I definitely made some really great friends there. In May 2024, the startup company I was working for started making layoffs. By then, I had already started thinking about leaving Austin. I had been in the city for five years and was itching for a change. Everything in my life was perfect on paper, but I still missed adventure. I've always been very curious about the world, and I really do think I'm the best version of myself when traveling. At the time, I was 29 and single. I had no husband, job, children, or pets. My parents were healthy, so I didn't really have anything tying me down. I decided, "Why don't I move abroad?" I had been working in sales, so I had built up quite a bit in savings. But once I decided to move, I sold everything — furniture, clothes, anything that I could get money from. In Austin, I lived alone in a 1,100-square-foot apartment on the East Side, downtown, and paid $1,800 monthly on rent. To save money, I moved back to my hometown and started picking up some shifts at a local boutique. I considered a lot of different places to move abroad. I had already lived in Australia, so I checked that off the list. I'd also been to Asia, which I enjoyed, but I felt that living there might have been too much of a culture shock. So, I began researching visa options for Europe. One option was a student visa, which I discovered could be obtained by enrolling in a language school. The visa was available in Portugal, Spain, and Italy. As a Texan, I didn't feel a strong need to learn Portuguese or Italian. I had also visited Spain when I was 22, during a backpacking trip with friends to Barcelona, and had a great time. I figured that if I moved there, I could learn Spanish and be close to the other European countries I wanted to visit. It took about four weeks to organize all of my paperwork for the visa. I had to obtain an FBI background check, get a medical clearance from a doctor, show proof of health insurance, and submit my bank statements to show that I had sufficient funds in my account. In the end, everything came together, and my visa was approved just three days before my flight to Spain in February. I attend a Spanish language school called Expanish in Spain. I have classes five days a week, four hours a day. The course lasts 40 weeks, with eight weeks of holiday included. I paid $6,800 in total. I live in a neighborhood pretty close to the Church of La Sagrada Família , which is not only the most famous building in Barcelona, but possibly in all of Spain. Since I'm in such a central area, there are a lot of tourists and markets around, but the area itself is still fairly quiet. My building is between three major metro stations. Figuring out the metro was initially a challenge for me as an American, but it turned out to be super easy. I feel safe walking there day or night because the area has low crime. I got really lucky finding an apartment through a rental website called Idealista. They matched me with a couple, and I'm paying €600 ($686) for my room. I pay €10 ($11) a month for WiFi, plus water and electricity, which adds another €40 ($46) a month. The apartment is around 753 square feet and came fully furnished, which was great. We have air conditioning, but unfortunately, it doesn't reach my room, which is rough in the summer. Meeting people in Barcelona is easy, and the people are very warm and welcoming. The city is filled with people from all over the world. Most are away from their families, here for a year or two, so eventually, you end up creating your own little family. Often, making friends is as simple as going out and striking up a conversation — if you hear someone speaking English, you just start talking. I've met plenty of people through my language school, though it tends to be a revolving door since it's a temporary program, and most students are only around for three or four months. Outside of school, I've built friendships through Bumble BFF. I also joined a volleyball league when I first got here, and I play regularly. I haven't ventured onto the dating apps just yet. I'm 30, and I do want to build toward a relationship, but I feel like I need to get my life a bit more together first. That said, I'm definitely having fun meeting people. I've met guys from Brazil, the Netherlands, and Colombia — it's been a really fun mix. Honestly, it feels a bit like being a kid in a candy store. Most of my time here has been really positive. I spend a lot of time at the beach, and I'm walking up to 20,000 steps a day. You can really see the difference in my face. I've also been traveling. In July, I visited Menorca, one of the Balearic Islands off the coast of Spain. My round-trip flight was only €40 ($45.72). I just packed a backpack with bikinis and went. This month, I'm also heading to Mallorca because I scored free tickets to the Love Island UK finale. Right now, I earn money tutoring both kids and adults in English during after-school hours. I'm also helping my cousin, a lawyer in Texas, with some administrative work. My current visa is valid for one year and will expire in early February 2026. I'd love to stay longer, so I'm exploring the option of applying for a digital nomad visa. It's available in several European countries and essentially allows you to live and work remotely, as long as you meet certain income requirements and have health insurance. As for moving back to the US, I don't plan on it, at least not if I don't have to. Of course, there are cultural challenges that come with living abroad, especially in a place where you don't know the language or the people. I also miss my family, and get a little sad when I miss family events or big moments in their lives and can't be there in person. But I've come to realize that life keeps moving — both for them and for me. My motto is: you choose your hard. For me, marriage and raising a child right now would be difficult. For someone else, it might be moving overseas alone without knowing the language. But that's the kind of hard I'd gladly choose any day. Jump to

Title: Some strategists see a stock-market bubble brewing — and it's not the Magnificent 7's fault this time
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-bubble-magnificent-seven-terrific-20-sp500-valuations-2025-7

Stock valuations are getting frothy again, but this time, it's not all Big Tech's fault. Yes, valuations of the Magnificent Seven stocks — Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Tesla — are back up after since bottoming in April. Yet, the group's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio is still down from mid-2024, mid-2023, and 2020 levels. Meanwhile, forward PE ratios on the next 20 stocks in the S&P 500 continue to surge, topping levels seen earlier this year. Their valuations are also higher than at any point over the last decade. Arun Sai, a senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management, calls the group the "Terrific 20." Some may see the rising forward expectations for a widening number of stocks as a sign of health, as the rally extends beyond just the most popular stocks. But when stocks rise because of multiple expansion instead of earnings growth, it may be a sign that investor sentiment is becoming overheated. "These companies span a broad set of sectors more closely tied to the real economy, including financials, energy, industrials, consumer, and legacy tech," Sai wrote on Tuesday. "Names like Broadcom, Walmart, JPMorgan, Berkshire Hathaway, Visa, and GE Aerospace now account for ~17% of the MSCI US index, compared to 33% for the Mag 7." "Broader participation is a positive — when it's driven by earnings," he continued. "But when more of the market gets expensive, the narrative that 'US equities aren't overpriced, just a few exceptional companies are' becomes harder to justify." Sai compared the current environment to the so-called "Nifty Fifty" bubble in the 1960s. Richard Bernstein, the founder of Richard Bernstein Advisors and former chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, said in June that there are parallels to another famous episode of euphoria—the dot-com bubble of 2000—as the market seems solely focused on an emerging technology. On Wednesday, Bernstein reiterated his skepticism of the rally, noting that the market is still relatively concentrated even if valuations are surging among more than just the top seven stocks. Trading of leveraged ETFs, zero-day options, and low dollar-value stocks is also picking back up, signs of excess optimism, he said. "If you're a trader, I think you should take a deep breath and kind of look at what's going on and realize that everybody's in this huge speculative fervor," Bernstein told Business Insider. "But if you're an investor and you want to be a little patient, I don't think it gets much better than this." "The reckless abandon is going to leave you with so many opportunities," he continued. "It's going to be like post-2000." Most Wall Street strategists don't see a dramatic pullback ahead, and few have made direct comparisons to prior bubble episodes. In recent days, however, some have extended quiet warnings to investors about the market's near-term direction. Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, CIO Americas and global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note on Tuesday that "investors should be mindful of potential market swings in the coming weeks," and that "capital preservation or phasing-in strategies can be effective in navigating near-term volatility." While valuations are no doubt extended, there's no guarantee a major market top is near, and the AI trade may have room to run as the technology evolves. Meta and Microsoft, for example, reported strong earnings beats this week and gave positive forward guidance, causing shares to soar. Jump to

Title: Economic Reality Bites Trump and His Protectionist Trade Policies
URL: https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/economic-reality-bites-trump-and-his-protectionist-trade-policies
Time Published: 2025-08-01T23:17:41Z

Georg Riekeles knows about hardball trade negotiations: during the long and arduous talks about the terms on which Britain would leave the European Union, he was an adviser to Michel Barnier, the E.U.’s chief negotiator. Back in April, when Riekeles saw that President Donald Trump issued an order, which was subsequently suspended, imposing blanket tariffs of twenty per cent on E.U. exports to the United States, he had a clear view on how the Europeans should respond: by threatening hefty duties on U.S. exports to Europe. This was what China had done, and it seemed possible that America’s other major trading partners would join together to force Trump to relent. “What was needed was for the E.U. negotiators to prepare a broad retaliatory package,” Riekeles, who is now an associate director at the European Policy Center, a Brussels think tank, told me this week. The E.U. did hit back by imposing hefty duties on some iconic U.S. goods, including Kentucky bourbon and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Subsequently, it threatened to expand the levies to U.S. aircraft, car parts, and certain other products. But, in the end, it held back from threatening Trump-style blanket tariffs and invoking the E.U.’s new Anti-Coercion Instrument, a policy tool that was introduced in 2023 to deal with external economic pressure, which would have enabled it to target U.S. banks and tech giants, such as Google and Meta, which have huge businesses in Europe. Referring to the E.U. leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, Riekeles said, “They never got going on a really punitive package.” At the start of this week, the White House announced a one-sided framework agreement in which most European goods that enter the United States will face a levy of fifteen per cent. The announcement said that the E.U. had agreed to eliminate all tariffs on U.S industrial goods, invest six hundred billion dollars in the United States, and greatly increase its purchases of U.S. energy products and military equipment. “This is a pretty disastrous outcome—a capitulation and a humiliation all in one,” Riekeles said. “The E.U. leaders didn’t take the full measure of Trump’s trade policies and what his Presidency is about.” In Trump’s telling, of course, his goal is to revive American manufacturing, reduce the trade deficit, and raise revenues. Last month, as the stock market hit new highs and some economic indicators were suggesting that the economy as a whole was holding up surprisingly well under his tariff onslaught, he wrote on social media. “The Fake News and the so-called ‘Experts’ were wrong again. Tariffs are making our Country ‘BOOM’.” A series of economic reports that were released this week illustrated the emptiness of Trump’s claims. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department released figures showing that during the first half of 2025 G.D.P. growth slowed sharply compared with last year. Frantic efforts by businesses and consumers to front-run Trump’s tariffs by ordering foreign-produced goods before the levies took effect have distorted the quarterly G.D.P. figures, which show the economy contracting at an annualized rate of 0.5 per cent from January to March and growing at a seemingly healthy rate of three per cent between April and June. If you combine the figures to correct for the distortions, they show G.D.P. expanding at a rate of 1.3 per cent during the past six months, compared with 2.8 per cent in 2024. That’s a big drop. Given all the uncertainty created by the chaotic rollout of Trump’s new tariff regime, it’s hardly surprising that employers have been thinking twice about hiring workers. The official employment report for June, which was released a month ago, showed weakness in many private-sector industries, but the over-all scale of the slowdown wasn’t clear until the July report came out, on Friday. Leaving aside seasonal farm labor, employers created seventy-three thousand new positions last month, a smaller number than Wall Street was expecting. But the real shocker came in the revised estimates for May and June, which showed that job growth fell to below twenty thousand in each month. That amounts to a virtual standstill. Taking the last three months as a whole, employment growth has been weaker than in any comparable period since the covid-19 pandemic. Trump’s initial response to the jobs report was to renew his attacks on the Federal Reserve, and its chair, Jerome Powell, for not acceding to his demands for a cut in interest rates. “Powell is a disaster,” he wrote on Truth Social immediately after the job figures were released. Later in the day, again on Truth Social, Trump announced that he was firing the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the monthly employment report. In another post, he sought to justify this unprecedented step by claiming that the July job figures had been rigged to make him and other Republicans look bad. The reality is that the B.L.S. is staffed by statisticians and other data experts, many of them career public servants, who go to great lengths to produce accurate figures. Even by his standards, Trump’s effort to find a scapegoat was pretty pathetic. As for the Fed, which held its benchmark interest rate steady at a policy meeting earlier this week, it isn’t responsible for the fact that many firms are responding to Trump’s tariffs by holding off on hiring and starting to raise their prices. Another economic report released this week showed the rate of inflation, as captured by the Fed’s preferred metric, edged up to 2.6 per cent in June, from 2.4 per cent in May. That means inflation is still above the Fed’s two-per-cent target, and it points to a possible return of stagflation, in which price rises accelerate at the same time that the economy stagnates. At times, Trump and his economic advisers have suggested that it may be a worthwhile trade-off for the economy to suffer some short-term pain in exchange for raising tariffs and bringing down the trade deficit, which in four of the past five years has totalled more than three per cent of G.D.P. Although this argument seems to make some intuitive sense, it’s hard to back up empirically. “The data shows there is just no relationship between trade balances and tariffs.” Joseph Gagnon, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in Washington, told me. The Trump policy agenda “is based on a mistaken premise,” Gagnon added. One way that Trump’s tariffs could bring down the trade deficit, which is the gap between exports and imports, is by eventually knocking the economy into a full-on recession. But, if this happens, the narrowing in the gap won’t have anything to do with removing foreign trade barriers: it will be because American consumers and businesses have less money to spend on everything, imported goods included. As Americans wait nervously to see whether this is the future awaiting them, many people in other countries are coming to terms with a world in which the U.S. government has transitioned from acting as the principal guarantor of an open trading system to operating what is essentially a global protection racket. “This is about coercion and coercive bargaining,” Riekeles said. “The U.S. Administration is pursuing an approach that doesn’t take account of any rules, or prior commitments, but is purely based on might. Might is right. If you can get something by exerting pressure, then do it. If you are not willing to exert counter-pressure, you are going to end up being weak and bullied.” Under a series of executive orders that Trump signed this week, levies ranging from ten per cent to fifty per cent will be imposed on goods from scores of nations, beginning next Thursday. As is only to be expected, most of the coverage of Trump trade policies focussed on major U.S. trading partners, such as Canada, Mexico, Japan, India, and the E.U. But the list of places whose products will be subjected to tariffs include poverty-stricken Chad and Lesotho; Laos and Iraq, two countries that have surely suffered enough in the past from U.S. actions, will face respective tariffs of forty per cent and thirty-five per cent. From an economic and business perspective, the fact that the new tariff regime is so complicated—vastly different rates across countries, with exemptions for certain goods—is an additional burden. But from Trump’s Mafia-boss perspective it is a feature rather than a bug, because it allows him to reward and punish individual nations and industries based on his political whims. Thus, coffee and many other goods from Brazil, which has incurred his wrath by indicting his fellow-strongman Jair Bolsonaro, will be hit with duties of fifty per cent, but Brazilian iron ore, which the politically powerful U.S. steel industry relies on, will be exempted. After Canada announced this week that it supported Palestinian statehood, Trump wrote on Truth Social, “That will make it very hard for us to make a Trade Deal with them.” Another novel feature of the deals that the Trump Administration has made is that, under duress, Japan and the E.U. pledged to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States. Evidently, Trump is using the same playbook with which he bullied universities and law firms by threatening to withhold federal funding and contracts. There is also a historical analogy. The new Trumpian trade regime, featuring tribute transfers to the hegemon as well as high tariff walls, resembles the extractive economic policies of the Ming dynasty more than the open trade order to which American Presidents from Harry Truman to Barack Obama pledged fealty. “In Europe, we still have the habit of thinking of the U.S. as a friend and ally,” Riekeles quipped. Trump is helping many non-Americans to break this habit. At home, meanwhile, he is resorting to the actions of a petty dictator by attacking the independent central bank and firing an economic scorekeeper. If he persists with this strategy, it will further undermine the credibility and strength of the U.S. economy, but it surely won’t enable him to disguise the consequences of his policies. They are already becoming clearer. ♦

If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Rolling Stone may receive an affiliate commission. Flip flops are back, according to the fashion world, with the Y2K sandals popping up on runways and red carpets seemingly everywhere. But, according to those of us who don’t attend fashion shows or A-list movie premieres, flip flops never left. The best flip flops are as much a summer essential as they’ve ever been, whether you’re headed to a five-star resort or a public pool. However, not all flip flops are made equal. Some offer extra support, others feature a superior build quality, and a good portion of flip flops are just not the move, stylewise (even with the sandals’ trendiness). Ahead, our style editors have rounded up TK of the best flip flops to wear in 2025, including everything from budget picks to high-end options. $69.99 Rainbow’s flip flops are a best-seller for good reason. They offer great support that only gets better as you wear them in, and feature a classic surfer look. The sandals’ nylon and leather construction is built to last for years of flapping on sand, sidewalks, and rocks, more than justifying their price tag over cheap rubber flip flops. $13.00 $26.00 50% off We love classic Havaianas. Their straightforward rubber construction is ideal for beating up and getting wet, and the iconic logo (especially paired with the Brazil flag) is instantly recognizable. They’re not great for long walks, but I think they look just as cool as the ones designers are putting out right now. The difference? They cost $26 on Amazon (on sale right now for $13). $75 British label Orlebar Brown is best known for its upscale swim trunks, so its no surprise they make a great flip flop too. Playful yet grown-up, these Hastons sandals feature a plush cork footbed, colorful stripes on the sides, and soft rubber thongs. For flip flops from a designer like OB, they’re also very reasonably priced at $75. $80 If you’re looking for something that can handle more steps — maybe down a long beach trail — check out these best-selling Ohana flip flops from OluKai. The cushioned footbed is moulded for maximum support, and the sole features a grippy texture for traction. The thongs are also thick and well-fitted for better mobility. They’re not the most fashionable (in our opinion), but they’re easily the most functional option on this list. $395 Want to see how designers are elevating flip flops? Check out these ​​Grosgrain sandals from Brunello Cucinelli. They’re not the uber-popular thongs from The Row (you can buy those here, if they’re in stock), but they have a similar upscale look and big-name designer tag to boot. They boast namesake grosgrain straps and a premium leather footbed that feels right at home in a fancy beachfront hotel. $65 Reef flip flops are still the go-to flip flops for actual surfers. Our favorite pair is the Fanning, named after the 3X world champion Mick Fanning. The sandals have lots of great features, like a plush, supportive footbed and grippy sole, but they have one amazing feature: a bottle opener on the bottom. Gross? Maybe. Endlessly fun? Absolutely. $139.00 Who says flip-flops can’t be chic? This sleek black pair from best-selling brand Raye begs to differ. Featuring a knotted strap and cushioned insole, they’re as versatile as it gets. Pair them with a breezy maxi dress and your favorite designer bag (maybe leave the Labubu at home this time), or keep it casual with jeans and a vintage band tee. Bonus: Revolve offers two-day shipping, so if you’re in the middle of a flip-flop emergency (yes, that’s a thing), they’ll be at your door in 48 hours or less. $70.00 I’ve long been obsessed with TKEES, and apparently so has J.Lo. Jenny from the Block was recently spotted strolling in a pair of their sandals, and let’s be honest: she wouldn’t settle for just anything. This particular style features a sleek metallic finish (available in silver and gold) and comes in sizes 5 through 11. $80.00 Dolce Vita has been in my rotation since I stumbled upon the brand while working at a boutique in 2017 (they were even my wedding shoes). So it’s no surprise that this elevated flip-flop made the cut. With its platform design and small heel, it easily passes for a dressier shoe at first glance. But don’t be fooled, the single criss-cross strap makes it a bona fide flip-flop, just with a major upgrade. $300.00 Jellies are so back, baby. The early-2000s design has officially returned, and frankly, we’re glad. These squishy, comfy sandals were once seen on every celeb and magazine cover, and now, they’re having a moment in 2025. Christopher Esber’s take on the jelly flip-flop brings that same Y2K vibe but with a slight twist. Try the trend out for yourself by pre-ordering this pair from FWRD. $98.00 A timeless and classic choice, this pair from Kate Spade Outlet is a great option for under $100. Their crisp white design makes them easy to wear, while the subtle floral detailing adds a unique touch that sets them apart from basic white flip-flops — definitely no 2005 Old Navy vibes here. The brand states that they are “crafted from smooth leather,” which will help them last over time. $750.00 These might look like a normal pair of black flip-flops, but don’t be fooled: they’re far from normal. Spotted on celebs like Jennifer Lawrence and Zoë Kravitz, these viral sandals are hardly ever in stock. Snag a pair in your size while you still can — they won’t be around for long. $30.00 Havaianas are arguably the most iconic flip flop company in the world. The Brazilian-born brand is known for its ultra-comfy, no-frills styles, like this classic beige pair. With six other color options to choose from, your flip-flop rotation is officially set. $35.00 At under $40, these jelly flip-flops from Jeffrey Campbell are an absolute steal. They’ve got a fun retro vibe and add a cool pop of color to whatever you pair them with. One Anthropologie reviewer even raved, “Surprisingly comfy for jellies. Obsessed with the green color this season, and they’re perfect. I didn’t think jelly flip-flops could elevate an outfit, but these did!” $12.99 $13.99 7% off And when you just need something easy, these Amazon flip flops get the job done. Great for the beach, quick errands, or letting the dog out, they’re currently on sale for under $13. Plus, with your Prime membership, they can arrive as soon as the next day for that last-minute trip you forgot to pack for. We want to hear it. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

Read By Platformonomics TGIF is a weekly roll-up of links, comments on those links, and perhaps a little too much tugging on my favorite threads. Type your email… Subscribe Quarterly CAPEX week, plus updates from a bunch of our favorite recurring characters! This has to be the high point of your Hot (Mess of an Epstein Coverup) Summer! Buckle up, as we have a lot this week! Coin flip whether I write next week. The four hyperCAPEX companies spent $96.78 billion on CAPEX, up 25% from Q1 and up 65% from a year ago. Nearly 12 digits. In a quarter. The usual caveat: this is overwhelmingly cloud/AI spend except for Amazon which also spends on warehouses, trucks, satellite constellations, etc. AWS was 61% of Amazon’s CAPEX spend in calendar 2024 (they don’t break out quarterly), so the AWS Q2 spend was probably on par with Google and Microsoft ($20B+). UPDATE: Amazon is now breaking out CAPEX by segment on a quarterly basis. AWS spent $16.043B in Q2, so only 52% of company CAPEX spend. That is down 22% from Q1, up 25% from a year ago. 🚨🚨🚨 The companies remain supply-constrained, and are starting to highlight ballooning depreciation costs on the horizon, which will impact earnings. And the useful life of cutting edge GPUs remains unknown. Previous: Big CAPEX Scoreboard – Q1 2025, Big CAPEX Scorecard – Q4 2024, Big CAPEX Scorecard – Q3 2024, Follow the CAPEX: Cloud Table Stakes 2024 Retrospective Related: AI capex may be ~2% of US GDP in 2025, SPV Financing Risks Amazon-wide CAPEX was $33.32 billion, up 32% for the quarter, up 85% for the year. Amazon gave no specific breakdown of their CAPEX other than saying it was “primarily” for AWS, so we’ll assume AWS CAPEX was ~60% of the total. UPDATE: Amazon is now breaking out CAPEX by segment on a quarterly basis. AWS spent $16.043B in Q2, so only 52% of company CAPEX spend. That is down 22% from Q1, up 25% from a year ago. 🚨🚨🚨 Despite beating on both revenue and earnings, the market didn’t like Amazon’s guidance and/or AI positioning. “It is early days…” blah blah blah “…it is early days” didn’t compel. This the first time I can recall that the FinTwit mob going after CEO and AWS AI product manager Andy Jassy. Time for a Polymarket bet on whether Bezos returns as CEO? CAPEX: Now turning to our cash CapEx, which was $31,400,000,000 in q two. AWS continues to be the primary driver as we invest to support demand for our AI services and increasingly in custom silicon like Tranium, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. Additionally, we continue to invest in our fulfillment and transportation network to support growth of the business, improve delivery speeds, and lower our cost to serve by investing in same day delivery facilities as well as robotics and automation. Supply constraints: You know, as I mentioned, well, we have more demand than we have capacity at this point. And I think that and and you see, you know, some of the constraints, and they kind of exist in multiple places. The single biggest constraint is power. But I you know, you also see constraints off and on with chips and then some of the components that, you know, once you have the chips to actually make the servers, you know, you there are you know, sometimes you have new generations of chips that are a little bit later than they’re supposed to be and sometimes you get the chips and, you know, the yield you get in making servers isn’t what you what you expect when you get to ramp. Guidance: We expect Q2 CapEx to be reasonably representative of our quarterly capital investment rate for the back half of this year. Depreciation: AWS margins also saw headwinds from higher depreciation expense as well as unfavorable impacts from year over year fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The depreciation expense is a result of our growing investments in capital expenditures in AWS. As we’ve said in the past, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we are making at any point in time. We will continue to invest more capital in chips, data centers, and power to pursue this unusually large opportunity that we have in generative AI. “Early Days”: Question: So there is a Wall Street Finance person narrative right now that AWS is falling behind in GenAI with concerns about share loss to peers, etcetera. Can you just sort of address that? What what is your rebuttal to that? So on on the first one around AI, the first thing I would say is that I think it is so early right now in AI. <six paragraphs of platitudes> I still think it’s very early days in AI and in terms of adoption. Such a missed opportunity to let us know exactly how many steps we now are into the AI race. Previous: Amazon CAPEX – Q4 2024, Amazon CAPEX – Q3 2024, Q2 Amazon CAPEX, Q1 Amazon CAPEX, AWS re:Invent Weirdness, The Arc of the Generative AI Universe Bends Towards Cash: Anthropic Edition, Culture Clash Conjecture: Amazon and Anthropic, Amazon Even More Bullish on Finding a Compression Algorithm for Experience, 326 Features into a 10k Race, Existential Corner: How Many Steps into the 10K are We?, Team Primitives: What Sayest Thou?, Amazon Desperately Seeks Compression Algorithm for Experience, Most Greatest AI Company in Entire Universe Makes Major Strategy Pivot, SEC Embraces Platformonomics ClownWatch™, Warns Amazon and IBM, The AWS Generative AI Soap Opera, The Amazon AI Inferiority Complex $22.45 billion, up 31% from Q1, up 70% from a year ago. Google is ramping CAPEX nicely, but it has taken awhile (and Google had skimped on CAPEX for a few years before the AI boom). Data centers: We operate the leading global network of AI-optimized data centers and cloud regions. CAPEX: With respect to CapEx in the second quarter, our CapEx was $22.4 billion. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested in technical infrastructure, with approximately two-thirds of investments in servers and one-third in data centers and networking equipment. Supply constraints: While we have been working hard to increase capacity and have improved the pace of server deployments, we expect to remain in a tight demand-supply environment going into 2026. As Sundar mentioned earlier, this is not the type of investment that’s a light switch. It takes time to make this investment. So what you’re seeing now is investments we made some time ago that’s now translating to additional capacity coming online, but more of that towards the back end of the year. Guidance: Moving to investments, given the strong demand for our Cloud products and services, we now expect to invest approximately $85 billion in CapEx in 2025, up from a previous estimate of $75 billion. Our updated outlook reflects additional investment in servers, the timing of delivery of servers and an acceleration in the pace of data center construction, primarily to meet Cloud customer demand. Looking out to 2026, we expect a further increase in CapEx due to the demand we’re seeing from customers as well as growth opportunities across the company. Depreciation: In terms of expenses. First, as I mentioned on our previous earnings call, the significant increase in our investments in CapEx over the past few years will continue to put pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In the second quarter, depreciation increased $1.3 billion year-over-year to $5 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 35%. Given the recent increase in CapEx investments, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate further in Q3. Previous: Google CAPEX – Q4 2024, Google CAPEX – Q3 2024, Q2 Google CAPEX, Q1 Google CAPEX $17.01 billion, up 25% from Q1, up 100% from a year ago. Despite being the runt of the hyperCAPEX litter, Meta is currently by far the most entertaining of the bunch to watch, as we try to match their ambitions to their capabilities. No Big Tech company oscillates more in perception between future dominance and doomed roadkill than Meta. They’re already into their second AI cycle, as they take a mulligan and do a complete restart. So many interesting paradoxes. If you throw enough money around on a restart, maybe no one will ask why the last effort went awry? Why does the company need to create a new organization “unencumbered by the bureaucracy of the $1.8tn company“? Personal superintelligence sounds great, but why would anyone trust them to run it? (Apple so much better positioned, but, alas, execution issues). Putting datacenters in tents? In hurricane country? As the hyperCAPEX runt, how exactly does Meta plan to “have the largest compute fleet of any company“? (don’t make me publish the cumulative CAPEX chart yet again). And where will they get the power? CAPEX: Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $17.0 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Guidance: Turning now to the capex outlook. We currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $66-72 billion, narrowed from our prior outlook of $64-72 billion and up approximately $30 billion year-over-year at the mid-point. While the infrastructure planning process remains highly dynamic, we currently expect another year of similarly significant capex dollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our AI efforts and business operations. On the CapEx side, the big driver of our increased CapEx in ‘26 will be scaling GenAI capacity as we build out training capacity that’s going to drive higher spend across servers, networking, data centers next year. So at present, we’re not really thinking about external use cases on the infrastructure, but I’d say it’s a good question. Depreciation (may be optimistic on deprec schedules – CHAOS) That’s driven primarily by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth in 2026, largely driven by recognizing incremental depreciation from assets that we purchased and placed in service in ‘26 as well as from infrastructure deployed through 2025 that we’ll recognize a full year of depreciation next year. While we’re still very early in planning for next year, there are a few factors we expect will provide meaningful upward pressure on our 2026 total expense growth rate. The largest single driver of growth will be infrastructure costs, driven by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth and higher operating costs as we continue to scale up our infrastructure fleet We also expect a greater mix of our CapEx to be in shorter-lived assets in 2025 and ‘26 than it has been in prior years. Financing CAPEX: …on your second question about how we expect to finance the growing CapEx next year. We certainly expect that we will finance some large share of that ourselves, but we’re also exploring ways to work with financial partners to codevelop data centers. We don’t have any finalized transactions to announce, but we generally believe that there will be models here that will attract significant external financing to support large-scale data center projects that are developed using our ability to build world-class infrastructure while providing us with flexibility should our infrastructure requirements change over time. So we are exploring many different paths Previous: Meta CAPEX – Q1 2025, Meta CAPEX – Q4 2024, Meta CAPEX – Q3 2024, Q2 Meta CAPEX, Q1 Meta CAPEX, CAPEX Clues: Enter LlamaGate, Meta AI: Founder Mode or “Win Now” Mode?, Is This Founder Mode?

It’s the Copy Button., Remember the Metaverse? $24.2 billion for the quarter, up 13% from Q1, up 27% from a year ago. Satya “I’m good for my $80 billion” Nadella in fact spent $88.2 billion in the promised fiscal year. Data centers: We opened new DCs across six continents, and now have over 400 datacenters across 70 regions, more than any other cloud provider. We stood up more than two gigawatts of new capacity over the past 12 months alone. And we continue to scale our owned datacenter capacity faster than any other competitor. Demand: And, while we brought additional datacenter capacity online this quarter, demand remains higher than supply. CAPEX: Capital expenditures were $24.2 billion, including $6.5 billion of finance leases where we recognize the full value at the time of lease commencement. Cash paid for P, P, and E, was $17.1 billion. The difference is primarily due to finance leases. More than half of our spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, and driven by strong demand signals. Guidance: Capital expenditure growth, as we shared last quarter, will moderate compared to FY25 with a greater mix of short-lived assets. Due to the timing of delivery of additional capacity in H1, including large finance lease sites, we expect growth rates in H1 will be higher than in H2. We expect Q1 capital expenditures to be over $30 billion driven by the continued strong demand signals we see. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services on a significant base. Even as we continue bringing more datacenter capacity online, we currently expect to remain capacity constrained through the first half of our fiscal year.

The “hipster antitrust” movement has been hugely influential in recent years, despite lacking any kind of an intellectual model for antitrust beyond shouting “break them up”. You can argue these hipsters helped drive Silicon Valley into Trump’s arms, amongst other consequences. Lately the hipsters have been vociferous in their opposition to the Abundance book and movement, which takes the radical position that governments should try to make their policies actually work. Abundance author Derek Thompson decided to dig into the hipsters’ criticisms: The sharpest criticisms of the book Abundance have sometimes come from the antitrust movement. This group, mostly on the left, insists that the biggest problems in America typically come from monopolies and the corruption of big business. I’m not an economist or a lawyer. I’m just a journalist. To the extent that I’m good at anything, it’s calling people on the phone and writing down what they say. So I reached out to the primary sources that Musharbash quotes throughout the piece. What I found was astonishing. The economist Musharbash cites told me that his theories had been misapplied. The housing analysts quoted in the piece told me Musharbash distorted their points and reached dubious, or even flatly wrong, conclusions. The leading monopoly researcher I spoke to, whose work has been celebrated by the antitrust left, told me that the entire thrust of the article—and, by extension, much of the antitrust-housing philosophy—defied sophisticated antitrust analysis. The essay you’re reading is very long. But I can sum it up in one sentence: The Musharbash essay on Dallas—like too much of the antitrust left’s work on housing—is filled with out-of-context quotes, overconfident assertions lacking evidence, and generally misguided claims. The subsequent online discourse has been hilarious. And the hipsters have responded with insults and unsubstantiated claims, but no effort to refute the specifics.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Aug. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Microsoft tops $4T in valuation — great news for the company, not so great for its workers

If you own Microsoft stock, you’ve got to be happy. Microsoft’s latest financial results for the quarter ending June 30, 2025 were robust: Revenue reached $76.4 billion (up 18% year-over-year), with net income at $27.2 billion (up 24%). The primary driver was robust growth in Microsoft’s cloud and AI businesses. Azure’s revenue, which has finally been separated out in the financial reporting, now stands at $75 billion in annual revenue, representing a 34% surge for the year. Put it all together, and you can see why Microsoft has joined Nvidia in the $4-trillion valuation club. So much for the good news. Despite those impressive financials, Microsoft has laid off a substantial number of employees this year — about 25,000, to be exact, including roughly 9,100 in July alone (approximately 4% of its workforce). The layoffs have affected a broad range of divisions, including Xbox, engineering, and management layers. What’s driving these cuts is clearly not poor performance. Instead, Microsoft is betting that its aggressive $80 billion AI investments will pay off. Don’t take my word for it: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently noted the “incongruence” of laying off employees even as Microsoft is “thriving.” He called this dynamic “the enigma of success” in a tech industry where progress demands constant change, even when things are going well. “I want to express my sincere gratitude to those who have left,” he added. “Their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today. And for that, I am deeply grateful.” I’m sure deep gratitude will help keep a roof over their heads. Microsoft is far from alone in dumping once-valued employees for cheaper AI alternatives. IBM has cut 8,000 jobs so far this year. In particular, IBM is gradually replacing clerical jobs with AI, while its AskHR bot has taken over much of HR’s old workloads. At the same time, Meta is reducing its staff by 5% in 2025 as it switches gears from its metaverse dud to AI. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy put an even finer point on where things are headed. “As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done.” That means, he said, “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” This isn’t just happening in the US. In India, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has cut 12,000 jobs this year. Why? Because its customers are moving to AI, which has sharply cut the outsourcing work the company has historically profited from. Meanwhile, in Japan, Indeed and Glassdoor’s parent company has laid off 1,300 workers, approximately 6% of its workforce, according to CEO Hisayuki “Deko” Idekoba. “AI is changing the world,” he said. It certainly changed the world of the 130,000 or so tech jobs that have been lost this year, according to estimates by The Bridge Chronicle. Oh, and by the way, Indeed reports that tech job postings in July were down 36% from their early 2020 levels. Is this a great time to be looking for a tech job or what!? But for every fantasy job, like the $100-million AI jobs Meta is supposedly offering, there are hundreds of tech workers who have kissed their six-figure positions goodbye and thousands of clerical staffers who will no longer be making five-figure annual incomes. There’s one little problem with all these job cuts. We still don’t know whether AI can deliver the work goods. Sure, some jobs, such as repetitive HR or call-center work, can be largely replaced. Heck, we’ve seen that happen before. I remember when many call-center jobs were located in the US — before companies figured out that outsourcing such jobs to low-cost countries was cheaper. For jobs like these, AI is just the next step in cost-cutting. Companies often use AI like that — to cut costs. Not many are using it to help good workers become great workers. Instead, CEOs are buying the illusion that AI can magically replace highly skilled workers. I hate to break it to you: It can’t. Take programming. According to the 2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 84% of programmers now use or plan to use AI tools in their workflow. However — and this is a crucial point — 46% of AI-using developers don’t trust AI results. In fact, even as AI developer tools have supposedly improved, programmers are trusting them even less. Why? Because they’re spending a lot of their time fixing AI mistakes. AI programming tools make fine interns, but they’re not senior or even mid-level developers. Let’s also remember that in the last few weeks, Replit, the leading vibe-coding company, which promises to make “software creation accessible to everyone, entirely through natural language,” wrecked a production database for a senior tech executive who was trying, and spectacularly failing, to build a new application. The bottom line is that AI is not good enough, not yet anyway, to replace engineers and developers. This will come back and bite companies like Microsoft in the rump. Sure, the market loves companies that cut costs. But if AI doesn’t deliver on its promises, getting all those experienced ex-workers back in the foldwon’t be easy. Today, AI is great for getting people to believe that groups of bunnies love hopping on trampolines; but doing hard technical work? That’s another question entirely. Steven J.

U.S. stock market tumbled hard after a weak July jobs report and President Trump’s new tariffs on 66 countries reignited fears of a global trade war. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq plunged as job growth slowed to just 73,000, and unemployment rose to 4.2%. With sharp revisions in previous job data and fresh tariff shocks, investor confidence took a hit. Bond yields dropped, and recession fears are growing louder. Major stocks like Amazon and Apple slipped, while Wall Street now bets the Federal Reserve could cut rates in September to stabilize the slowing economy.

UPDATED 11:37 EDT / AUGUST 01 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Palo Alto Networks is charging full speed ahead on attempting to be as much of a one-stop cyber shop as is possible in the fast-changing field, buying CyberArk for a stunning $25 billion. Investors weren’t especially happy, but properly integrated, it’s probably worthwhile long-term. And as Zeus Kerravala notes, it’s a good addition for its artificial intelligence play. IPOs keep on coming, just this week from Ambiq and Figma — the latter up more than threefold so fast trading had to be halted, and then topped $140 in after-hours trading. Pops are back, baby. Of course, those represent money left on the table, but they could spur more of the tech industry’s prime wealth-building mechanisms that have been in short supply for years now. As for Figma’s success, you can thank former Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Kahn, of all people, Alex Wilhelm notes, since she resisted a deal with Adobe three years ago. Just when you thought AI funding couldn’t get any crazier… it does. OpenAI reportedly is in talks to raise $8.3 billion at a stunning $300 billion valuation, while Anthropic apparently is in talks to raise $5 billion at a $170 billion valuation and Mistral is looking for $1 billion at a $10 billion valuation. Vast Data also is reported to be looking at a multibillion-dollar funding at a $30 billion valuation. And get a load of all those $100 million-plus fundings of other AI or adjacent companies below. The dot-com boom had nothing on this…. Uh-oh. Some big tech companies are making a lot of money thanks in part to the AI boom — not just from selling it but from using its efficiencies internally, as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed out. But they’re also spending a lot to meet that demand, as Microsoft, Meta and Amazon showed this week. In fact, that’s what tripped up Amazon a day later, as its guidance came in light, suggesting its AI investments may take longer to pay off. For now, at least, their core businesses are doing well enough to support that spending. Next week there’s still a lot of earnings reports coming from Advanced Micro Devices, Supermicro, Uber, Lyft, Palantir and many more. Speaking of Zuckerberg, he thinks “superintelligence,” whatever that is, is almost here. Conveniently, he said it’s likely to be delivered via augmented reality glasses like the kind it makes, currently at a multibillion-dollar quarterly loss. I think some of us can be excused for worrying about tech titans deciding how this superintelligence will be used. Dave Vellante dove into stablecoins, finding they’re achieving… stability! Crypto can use some solidity to counter the continuing drumbeat of fraud and other nefarious uses of crypto. Vellante and John Furrier discuss this and other news, in particular digging into what’s really behind Amazon’s latest earnings, on this week’s podcast theCUBE Pod, out now on YouTube. Here’s all the enterprise and emerging tech news and analysis this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Zuckerberg outlines Meta’s vision for AI superintelligence Chief AI role gains traction as firms seek to turn pilots into profits OpenAI reportedly raises $8.3B in funding after annualized revenue tops $12B Report: Vast Data could raise multibillion-dollar funding round at $30B valuation French AI startup Mistral seeks to raise $1B at $10B valuation (per Financial Times) NiCE acquires customer service AI startup Cognigy for $955M Salesforce and ServiceNow in talks to invest ~$750M each in Genesys, which uses AI to automate customer service functions, valuing Genesys at ~$15B (per Bloomberg) Weeks after its last funding round, fintech startup Ramp raises $500M more AI-native clinical documentation startup Ambience Healthcare raises $243M Anaconda raises $150M+ to speed up Python-based AI projects Physical operations AI firm Motive raises $150M ahead of possible IPO AI infrastructure company fal raises $125M, valuing company at $1.5B Salient secures $60M to expand AI-powered loan servicing platform Lumana gets $40M to build more intelligent video surveillance systems Dropzone AI raises $37M to expand AI SOC analyst development and integrations Sparrow raises $35M in Series B funding to scale AI-powered solutions for leave management E2B shares its vision of sandboxed, cloud environments for every AI agent after raising $21M in funding Promptfoo raises $18.4M to build AI security and evaluation platform Echo secures $15M seed round to build AI-powered vulnerability-free application infrastructure AI data analyst startup Julius raises $10M seed round Streamline AI raises $8.6M to transform work for in-house legal operations teams Cyata Security gets $8.5M in funding to help companies get a grip on their AI agents Runloop raises $7M seed round to bring enterprise-grade infrastructure to AI coding agents Drizz launches with $2.7M to provide vision-based testing AI for mobile apps Microsoft turns Edge into an AI agent with new Copilot Mode Google DeepMind releases highly accurate AI model map of Earth Google rolls out powerful creative problem-solving AI model Deep Think to the Gemini app Amazon DocumentDB goes serverless with automatic scaling to support agentic AI workloads Chinese startup Z.ai releases cost-efficient GLM-4.5 reasoning model Writer releases autonomous AI ‘super agent’ for enterprise users OpenAI launches ChatGPT study mode to reduce AI misuse at schools and universities Google rolls out new ways to use AI Mode search with PDFs, images, live video and more Informatica tackles AI scaling roadblocks with new platform updates AI startup Artificial Societies simulates the behavior of target audiences to speed up market research Linux Foundation welcomes AGNTCY Project to standardize open multi-agent system infrastructure and break down AI agent silos Trump administration announces medical records access plan, but privacy issues loom Google said it will sign the EU AI Code of Practice There’s even more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Chipmaker Ambiq Micro shares soar 60%+ after $96M IPO Figma stock more than triples from $33 offering price in another blockbuster IPO Firefly Aerospace seeks $5.5 billion valuation in IPO as US space race heats up AI infrastructure firm WhiteFiber seeks $132.8M in IPO Microsoft crushes earnings expectations and its market cap soars above $4T And check out Dave Vellante’s analysis: Microsoft earnings: Turning up the heat with Azure, AI and the data center arms race, with proprietary data from theCUBE Research.

Title: Amazon Cloud Revenue Fails To Impress; Weak Jobs Number May Make Case For Rate Cut

ByJJ Kinahan ByJJ Kinahan, Senior Contributor. Key Takeaways After a strong opening on the back of solid earnings from Meta Platforms and Microsoft, markets gave up gains to close flat to down on the day. The S&P 500 lost 0.4% while the Nasdaq Composite closed flat. The Russell 2000 fell 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7%. But that only tells a small part of the story as to what took place during the day. Thursday marked the return of the IPO market in a big way. Figma, a company that makes collaborative tools for building apps and websites went public. The IPO market has been in a lull with several companies, such as Klarna, Chime and StubHub pulling back from plans to go public for various reasons. That placed a lot of attention on the Figma deal. After pricing the deal at $33 per share, the stock initially opened for trading at $85 and was quickly halted because of order imbalances. If you were watching the stock trade, it was a wild ride, but when it was all said and done, shares closed 250% above their IPO price at $115.50. There are a couple things to take away from this IPO. One, I think the fact the stock closed significantly higher than where it was priced speaks to why some companies do not like going the traditional IPO route. There is potential to leave a lot of money on the table. Second, the success of the IPO shows there may be demand from the market for new issues. That would be a potentially healthy sign. After the close Thursday, we had two big earnings releases. Both Amazon and Apple reported second quarter numbers. Both companies reported figures that beat estimates. In the case of Amazon, the company beat on both sales and profits. Amazon Web Services sales were up 17.5%. Cloud computing has been a dominant theme this quarter and the problem for Amazon was, 17.5% didn't cut it. By comparison, Alphabet reported growth of 32% and Microsoft grew 39% in their cloud businesses, respectively. Overnight, Amazon shares were down 7%. By contrast, shares of Apple traded higher after hours on Thursday after beating estimates. iPhones sales came in surprisingly strong. One item though that I think is worth mentioning is the impact of tariffs. Apple reported paying $800M in tariffs for the quarter and the company anticipates they will pay $1.1B in the next quarter. Therefore, we're beginning to see actual dollar figures being incorporated into sales earnings figures and estimates moving forward. Speaking of tariffs. Thursday night, President Trump issued an Executive Order enacting tariffs as his August 1st deadline was reached. The three countries I'll call out here are Mexico, Canada and China. In the cases of Mexico and China, negotiations are continuing, and extensions have been granted temporarily. While that is good, investors should also remain aware that it means there is potential for a market event if an agreement isn't reached. With respect to Canada, tariffs were originally set at 25%, but were increased to 35%, causing markets to pull back in overnight trading. This morning, there is yet more news. On the earnings front, Coinbase missed estimates and that stock is indicated lower by 11%. It's worth noting, however, Coinbase stock is up 135% since its April lows. Shares of Reddit are up 15% after they beat on earnings. The premarket move is pushing the stock through its 21-day moving average. On the economic front, we received the latest jobs report. According to Bloomberg, economists were expecting 106 thousand new jobs and an unemployment rate of 4.2%. The actual number of new jobs created was weaker than expected at 73 thousand, while unemployment held steady at 4.2%. A couple under-the-hood items worth mentioning here are the revisions and where jobs are being created. May and June jobs were revised down by 258 thousand. That is a fairly significant number. Also, the areas in which jobs were created continued to be sectors like home healthcare, which, as I've mentioned before, are not necessarily economic growth sectors. Heading into this morning's report, there was approximately a 40% chance of a rate cut at the Fed meeting in September. Following the report, according to the CME Fed Watch Tool, that probability jumped to 67%. I think markets have a bit of a tug of war scenario unfolding. The earnings data has been strong. Inflation has not shown up in the way many feared. At the same time, the jobs' number was weaker than expected and the downward revisions were large. However, that may give the Fed the ammunition it needs to cut interest rates. Tariffs are now in place, for the most part, and that should allow companies to make more concrete plans and forecasts moving forward. In other words, they have some stability, and markets are big fans of stability. I have mixed emotions about the Figma IPO. On the one hand, a strong IPO market is a good thing. On the other hand, when you take it in the context of the meme mania we've seen recently, it can be another FOMO-type froth indicator. We also have the VIX pushing up near 19 after having been below 16 just a couple days ago, and there are some other measures of volatility that are also creeping higher. For today, I am mainly watching VIX and 6301 in SPX, which is the 21-day moving average. A break below that level could signal some short-term weakness and while next week is lighter on economic data, it's still a big week for warnings. I think the rally we're seeing in bonds and optimism of a Fed rate cut could help give stocks some comfort, but with no meeting until September, there is still a lot of economic data between now and then. I suspect Fed Chair Powell would like to see how the newly signed tariffs show up in the economy, if he can, but I also think the political pressure to cut rates is going to ramp up even more. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives.

Title: Figma Stock Soars 255% Post IPO. Despite Bitcoin, Why To Avoid $FIG Now

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Figma's IPO exploded with a 255% surge, but was massively underpriced, primarily benefiting institutional investors and venture capitalists (post-lockup).Despite strong financials and high demand, the stock faces significant risks: intense competition, an extremely high valuation (P/S 69), and potential share dilution from early investors in January.Figma, a design collaboration platform, is expanding its user base beyond designers and integrating AI to drive future growth. Figma stock exploded out of the IPO block Thursday – and trades about 255% above its offering price of $33, according to Yahoo! Finance. Figma – founded in 2012 – makes software that helps designers to work together. The company is using artificial intelligence and extending its platform to other customer groups – notably software developers with “more than two-thirds of its users now nondesigners,” according to the New York Times. Should you buy Figma stock? Despite many positives about the company – including 46% revenue growth in the first quarter and a 20% net margin, according to the IPO prospectus, here are four reasons to avoid the stock: Figma sees a bright future. “We have so much room to explore how we can make great AI products and experiences,” Figma cofounder and CEO Dylan Field told Bloomberg. “This is a time where we can create tremendous value for our community, our customers, and I think the public market is the right place to do it,” he added. Figma’s IPO produced an attention getting pop – with shares up 255% in the day since the company went public. The massive underpricing of this IPO leaves a whopping $48.7 billion on the table. By selling roughly 7% of its shares at $33, noted the Wall Street Journal, Figma raised a mere $1.2 billion – only a third of which went to Figma – with investors getting the balance, noted CNBC. Had Figma set its offering price higher, it could have raised $3 billion more, the Journal reported. The biggest winners from the deal in the short term are the large institutional clients of the underwriters of the IPO – Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Allen & Company and JPMorgan Chase. “Who benefits?” Benchmark general partner Bill Gurley wrote on X, shortly after the stock began trading. “The large clients of the investment banks (who return the favor paying for other services). They bought it at $33 last night and can sell it today for over $90.” The other beneficiaries will be the venture capitalists who funded the company – which include Index Ventures, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia. However, these investors are bound by 180 day lockup agreements which prevent them from selling the stock until next January, CNBC reported. Other winners from this boffo Figma IPO are privately held tech companies which have been waiting to go public for years since the IPO market suffered a near collapse in November 2021 after word of Jerome Powell’s reappointment as Fed Chair -- to raise interest rates to cut pandemic era inflation. In September 2022, during the IPO market freeze, Figma had agreed to be acquired by Adobe for $20 billion, as I wrote in Forbes. That deal – which would have enabled Adobe to provide its customers with Figma’s very popular design collaboration service – fell apart in 2023 “after U.K. regulators said the tie-up would harm competition,” noted CNBC. Figma’s recovery from that deal’s collapse was indeed impressive – giving the company a valuation well above its $19.3 billion worth at the IPO – which is more than three times the value of the 2022 Adobe deal. While there are many reasons to own Figma stock, the case for avoiding the shares strike me as more compelling. In addition to the risks of the company suffering a stock market decline unless Figma beats and raises in the next several quarters and the possibility venture investors will dump their shares in January, here are two other reasons to avoid the stock: I would not be surprised to see the stock drop in the wake of the company’s next quarterly earnings report. However, if Figma can boost its per customer revenue by adding new services, such a decline could mark a better entry point for investors.

Nvidia stock price target 2025: Wall Street's confidence in Nvidia surges as Morgan Stanley raises its price target to $200, driven by exceptional demand for Blackwell GPUs. Enterprise and cloud giants are rapidly adopting these chips, leading to supply outpacing demand. Blackwell's superior performance, a 40x jump over Hopper, fuels this adoption, potentially representing 80% of Nvidia's high-end GPU shipments.

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Higher tariffs are coming, and they may bring big changes to the financial markets and economy. In turbulent times, proven dividend stocks can be a stabilizing force for your portfolio. They’re often less volatile than growth stocks, and they pay regular income—a welcome source of return when stock prices are struggling. If you're ready to shore up your income portfolio, take a look at these six dividend payers. One or two may offer the protection you need from tariffs, inflation and stock-price volatility in 2025. The screening criteria for these dividend stocks were designed to return dividend payers with low tariff exposure, the potential for rising cash income for inflation protection and a good balance between upside potential and downside risk: Five stocks met these parameters. They are presented below from largest to smallest market capitalization. The table below highlights five dividend stocks with a regular practice of increasing shareholder payouts. A review of each stock follows. Metrics are sourced from company reports and stockanalysis.com. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025. The PNC Financial Services Group by the numbers: PNC is a regional bank with branches in 28 states. The bank is organized into three reporting segments: retail banking, corporate and institutional banking and asset management group. The asset management group provides investing and wealth management services for individuals and institutions. PNC pays a quarterly dividend of $1.70, for a yield of 3.5%. The bank has raised its dividend annually for 14 years. The most recent increase was a $0.10 raise for the dividend to be paid on August 4, 2025. PNC is investing heavily in growing and improving its branch footprint. The expansion focuses on increasing the bank’s concentration and brand presence in existing markets. The bank has sufficient concentration in six markets, but the goal is 19. In PNC's last earnings report, Chairman and CEO Bill Demchak said the strategy was helping the bank acquire new customers faster and deepen relationships with existing customers. Financial highlights for the quarter included revenue growth of 4%, a 2-basis-point rise in net interest margin (NIM) and diluted EPS growth of 11.9%. NIM is the difference between interest earned on loans and interest paid on deposits, a critical profitability measure for banks. Elevance Health by the numbers: Elevance Health, formerly known as Anthem, operates health plans and provides pharmacy services in the U.S. Brand names in Elevance's portfolio include Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Wellpoint and Carelon. Elevance Health pays a quarterly dividend of $1.71, for a yield of 2.4%. The health care company has raised its dividend for 14 consecutive years. Recent increases have been generous, from $1.63 to $1.71 in 2025 and from $1.48 to $1.63 in 2024. Elevance Health is working through a two-part optimization that involves simplifying the health care experience and reducing costs. Progress on costs will be critical as 2025 unfolds. The company recently reversed slowing revenue growth with acquisitions, higher enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans and commercial plan premium increases—but margins have suffered. Despite the margin pressure, Elevance still expects to deliver 12% average annual growth in adjusted diluted EPS over the long term. In the second quarter, Elevance increased operating revenue 14.3% while diluted EPS declined 21.6%. The company had $8.5 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet at June 30, after generating $3 billion in operating cash flow in the first six months of 2025. VICI Properties by the numbers: VICI Properties is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns gaming, hospitality and entertainment properties in the U.S. and Canada. The portfolio includes Caesars Palace Las Vegas, MGM Grand and the Venetian Resort Las Vegas. In total VICI owns at least 60,000 hotel rooms, 500 restaurants and four championship golf courses. VICI pays a quarterly dividend of $0.4325, for a yield of 5.2%. The REIT has raised its dividend annually for seven years, moving the annual payout from $0.985 in 2018 to $1.69 in 2024. Advantages for VICI include strong balance sheet discipline and solid relationships with premier, deep-pocketed hospitality tenants. The company’s emphasis on unique and high-value properties has delivered annual revenue growth since 2020—notable given that resorts and entertainment destinations were largely shut down for part of 2020. VICI grows its business by acquiring or developing new properties. The company recently announced new partnerships with asset managers Eldridge Industries and Cain International and casino operator Red Rock Resorts. These relationships will support development projects in Beverly Hills and central California. In the first quarter, VICI increased revenue by 3.4%. Funds from operations (FFO), a REIT-specific operating cash flow metric, declined 7.9%. The decline related to a change in the company's credit loss allowance. Despite the FFO decline, VICI raised its full-year adjusted FFO guidance to a range of $2.47 billion to $2.5 billion. The prior FFO guidance range was $2.45 billion to $2.485 billion. M&T Bank Corporation by the numbers: M&T Bank is a holding company that owns M&T Bank, other M&T-branded financial companies and Wilmington Trust, NA. The company provides traditional banking and deposit services, plus wealth management expertise. M&T has more than 960 branches, which are concentrated in the northeastern U.S. MTB pays a quarterly dividend of $1.35, for a yield of 2.8%. The bank has raised its dividend annually since 2016, when it paid $0.70 quarterly. MTB specializes in small business and middle market banking with a commitment to personalized customer service. This contributes to a strong deposit base, one of MTB’s operational strengths. The bank's service has been recognized with "Best Bank" awards by Crisil Coalition Greenwich, a benchmarking and analytics provider. M&T had $19.3 billion in interest-bearing deposits and $35.6 billion in investments on the balance sheet as of June 30. In the June quarter, revenue increased 4% versus the prior year and diluted EPS rose 28%. The bank’s provision for credit losses declined 5%, indicating an improving loan portfolio. One trend to watch is M&T's net interest margin (NIM). In the second quarter, M&T's NIM declined 4 basis points. The metric is still higher than it was in the prior year, however. California Water Service Group by the numbers: California Water Service Group provides water utility services and wastewater treatment for more than two million customers in California, Hawaii, New Mexico, Texas and Washington. CWT is the third largest publicly traded water utility in the U.S. CWT pays a quarterly dividend of $0.30, for a yield of 2.7%. The utility company has raised its dividend annually for 59 years. The five-year compound annual growth rate of the dividend is 7.7%. CWT is financially strong and operates a regulated and predictable business —the qualities you want from a reliable dividend stock. The utility grows through infrastructure investment that outpaces depreciation and strategic acquisitions. In 2025 through 2027, CWT leadership expects to increase capital expenditures to more than four times depreciation. In the past 10 years, the target multiple has been three times. The utility has delivered consistent growth in non-GAAP revenue, net income and diluted EPS since 2022. A rate relief action that increased 2024 revenue by $90.3 million skews the growth in GAAP results. In the first quarter 2025, CWT reported adjusted revenue growth of 13% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 214%. Bottom Line The best dividend stocks to buy now aren't necessarily those with the highest yield. With uncertainty on the horizon for the U.S. economy, leaning into proven dividend payers is a smart strategy.

Beatrice Nolan is a reporter at Fortune covering tech. Beatrice previously worked as a tech reporter at Business Insider, covering stories about AI and Big Tech. She's based in Fortune's London office and graduated from the University of York with a bachelor's degree in English. Apple reported blowout earnings on Thursday, beating Wall Street’s predictions with its biggest revenue growth since December 2021. However, the market reaction was muted, with analysts citing concerns over long-term issues including tariffs and AI. The company reached $94 billion for the quarter ending June 28, driven by strong iPhone demand, surging services revenue, and solid performance across international markets, representing a 10% increase from the same time last year. Earnings per share came in at $1.57, well above the $1.43 analysts had forecast. Net income rose 12%, while gross margin ticked up to 46.5%. Despite the positive results, the company received a subdued response from investors, with its stock rising just over 2% in after-hours trading. Apple has already been dealing with a rough year, and the company’s stock price has dropped 17% year to date. “$AAPL shares are up 2% on great news and guidance, underscoring that investors don’t believe it’s sustainable,” Gene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management’s managing partner, said in an X post. Munster said Apple stock had become a “show-me” story as investors worry about “tariffs, regulatory changes, and Apple’s AI strategy come back to weigh on growth.” The somewhat muted reaction is likely down to a couple of ongoing sore points for Apple: the AI race and President Trump’s tariffs on China and India. The tariffs hit the company slightly less than previously estimated, costing Apple around $800 million rather than the $900 million CEO Tim Cook had predicted in March. Cook said that the impact was mainly in connection with Trump’s tariffs against China that hit “early in the year.” Kate Leaman, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, told Fortune that Apple was clearly nervous about the impact of further tariffs. “The risks to Apple are real,” she said. “Regulation is coming and tariffs are back in the headlines, with the US still locked in negotiations with China. And for firms like Apple, global politics and supply chains still matter a lot.” The tariff issue looks set to get worse for the tech giant before it gets better, with expected cost hits rising next quarter. “For the September quarter, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added,” Cook said on Thursday’s earnings call. “We estimate the impact to add about $1.1 billion to our costs.” Wedbush’s Dan Ives called tariffs a “problem for Apple” despite the company continuing to focus on production in India and the fact that the majority of iPhones sold in the US are now being made in the country rather than China, which has faced the most aggressive tariffs from the Trump administration. “Trade policy remains unsettled and uncertain, and Apple is acutely aware of the importance of remaining on the right side of the administration, lest it face increasing ire and tariff risk,” Forrester’s VP principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said. “It’s no surprise that Tim Cook was very particular in emphasizing several times Apple’s continuing investment in the United States and American innovation.” Apple has faced criticism for years for the company’s apparent failure to capitalize on the AI boom, and the company’s most recent earnings don’t appear to have soothed investors. “AI is the elephant in the room,” Ives, who has been less than impressed with the company’s AI efforts, said in a note. “While Apple is expanding its AI investments internally, the reality is it’s not moving the needle and patience is wearing thin about investors.” Apple has taken a few hits to AI efforts recently, losing at least four prominent AI researchers to Meta’s “Superintelligence” team. In a particularly harsh blow to Apple, Meta successfully managed to lure away the leader of the company’s AI division, Ruoming Pang, with a compensation package reportedly valued at more than $200 million. The hits to Apple’s talent haven’t helped the perception that the company is lagging behind competitors in the AI space. “The AI Revolution is the biggest technology trend in 40 years and right now Apple is watching this from a park bench drinking lemonade while every other Big Tech company is racing ahead like F1 drivers building out its AI strategy and monetization plan,” Ives said. “This continues to be the big problem for Cook as in our opinion, this is a black eye moment for Apple and is the major anchor on the ship.” Despite Cook confirming Apple was ramping up its internal AI investment, some investors, including Ives, are hoping the company will regain some ground through external partnerships or significant M&A. Cook has already signaled the company was “open to M&A that accelerates [Apple’s] roadmap.” Chatterjee called the company’s AI urgency “palpable” and observed a “quiet admission of its sluggishness in the acknowledgement that it may have to lean heavily on acquisition to compress timelines.” Some investors are hoping that Apple will acquire AI darling Perplexity, a fast-growing AI search startup seen as a potential springboard to overhaul Siri and close Apple’s AI gap with rivals like Google and Microsoft. “Rumors swirl about a Perplexity deal, and if that were to happen, it may greatly accelerate the elusive promise of a more effective Siri,” Chatterjee said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: 9 things you shouldn't use AI for at work

A few weeks ago, I shared with you "9 programming tasks you shouldn't hand off to AI - and why." It's full of well-reasoned suggestions and recommendations for how to avoid having an AI produce code that could ruin your whole day. Then, my editor and I got talking, and we realized the whole idea of "when not to use an AI" could apply to work in general. In this article, I present to you nine things you shouldn't use AI for while at work. This is far from a comprehensive list, but it should make you think. Also: This one feature could make GPT-5 a true game changer (if OpenAI gets it right) "Always keep in mind that AI isn't going to read you your Miranda Rights, wrap your personal information in legal protections like HIPAA, or hesitate to disclose your secrets," said LinkedIn Learning AI instructor Pam Baker, the bestselling author of ChatGPT For Dummies and Generative AI For Dummies. "That goes double for work AI, which is monitored closely by your employer. Whatever you do or tell AI can and likely will be used against you at some point." To keep things interesting, read on to the end. There, I share some fun and terrifying stories about how using AI at work can go terribly, horribly, and amusingly wrong. Without further ado, here are nine things you shouldn't do with AI at work. This is an easy one. Every time you give the AI some information, ask yourself how you would feel if it were posted to the company's public blog or wound up on the front page of your industry's trade journal. Also: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use) This concern also includes information that might be subject to disclosure regulations, such as HIPAA for health information or GDPR for personal data for folks operating in the EU. Regardless of what the AI companies tell you, it's best to simply assume that everything you feed into an AI is now grist for the model-training mill. Anything you feed in could later wind up in a response to somebody's prompt, somewhere else. Contracts are designed to be detailed and specific agreements on how two parties will interact. They are considered governing documents, which means that writing a bad contract is like writing bad code. Baaad things will happen. Do not ask AIs for help with contracts. They will make errors and omissions. They will make stuff up. Worse, they will do so while sounding authoritative, so you're more likely to use their advice. Also: You can use Google's Math Olympiad-winning Deep Think AI model now - for a price Also, the terms of a contract are often governed by the contract. In other words, many contracts say that what's actually in the contract is confidential, and that if you share the particulars of your agreement with any outside party, there will be dire consequences. Sharing with an AI, as discussed above, is like publishing on the front page of a blog. Let me be blunt. If you let an AI work on a contract and it makes a mistake, you (not it) will be paying the price for a long, long time. You know the trope where what you share with your lawyer is protected information and can't be used against you? Yeah, your friendly neighborhood AI is not your lawyer. As reported in Futurism, OpenAI CEO (and ChatGPT's principal cheerleader) Sam Altman told podcaster Theo Von that there is no legal confidentiality when using ChatGPT for your legal concerns. Also: Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks you shouldn't trust AI for therapy Earlier, I discussed how AI companies might use your data for training and embed that data in prompt responses. However, Altman took this assertion up a notch. He suggested OpenAI is obligated to share your conversations with ChatGPT if they are subpoenaed by a court. Jessee Bundy, a Knoxville-based attorney, amplified Altman's statement in a tweet: "There's no legal privilege when you use ChatGPT. So if you're pasting in contracts, asking legal questions, or asking it for strategy, you're not getting legal advice. You're generating discoverable evidence. No attorney/client privilege. No confidentiality. No ethical duty. No one to protect you." She summed up her observations with a particularly damning statement: "It might feel private, safe, and convenient. But lawyers are bound to protect you. ChatGPT isn't, and can be used against you." While we're on the topic of guidance, let's hit two other categories where highly trained, licensed, and regulated professionals are available to provide advice: healthcare and finance. Look, it's probably fine to ask ChatGPT to explain a medical or financial concept to you as if you were a five-year-old. But when it comes time to ask for real advice that you plan on considering as you make major decisions, just don't. Let's step away from the liability risk issues and focus on common sense. First, if you're using something like ChatGPT for real advice, you have to know what to ask. If you're not trained in these professions, you might not know. Also: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out Second, ChatGPT and other chatbots can be spectacularly, overwhelmingly, and almost unbelievably wrong. They misconstrue questions, fabricate answers, conflate concepts, and generally provide questionable advice. Ask yourself, are you willing to bet your life or your financial future on something that a people-pleasing robot made up because it thought that's what you wanted to hear? When you ask a chatbot to write something for you, do you claim it as your own? Some folks have told me that because they wrote the prompts, the resulting output is a result of their creativity. Also: I found 5 AI content detectors that can correctly identify AI text 100% of the time Yeah? Not so much. Webster's defines "plagiarize" as "to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own," and to "use (another's production) without crediting the source." The dictionary also defines plagiarize as "to commit literary theft: present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source." Does that not sound like what a chatbot does? It sure does "present as new and original an idea…derived from an existing source." Chatbots are trained on existing sources. They then parrot back those sources after adding a bit of spin. Let's be clear. Using an AI and saying its output is yours could cost you your job. The other day, I had a technical question about my Synology server. I filed a support ticket after hours. A bit later, I got an email response from a self-identified support AI. The cool thing was that the answer was complete and just what I needed, so I didn't have to escalate my ticket to a human helper. Also: Is AI overhyped or underhyped? 6 tips to separate fact from fiction But not all AI interactions with customers go that well. Even a year and a half later, I'm still chuckling about the Chevy dealer chatbot that offered a $55,000 Chevy Tahoe truck to a customer for a buck. It's perfectly fine to provide a trained chatbot as one support option to customers. But don't assume it's always going to be right. Ensure customers have the option to talk with a human. And monitor the AI-enabled process. Otherwise, you could be giving away $1 trucks, too. According to a survey by resume-making app Resume Builder, a majority of managers are using AI "to determine raises (78%), promotions (77%), layoffs (66%), and even terminations (64%)." "Why are you firing me?" "It's not my fault. The AI made me do it." Yeah, that. Worse, apparently at least 20% of managers, most of whom haven't been trained in the rights and wrongs of AI usage, are using AIs to make final employment decisions without even bothering to oversee the AI. Also: Open-source skills can save your career when AI comes knocking But here's the rub. Jobs are often governed by labor laws. Despite the current anti-DEI push coming from Washington, bias can still lead to discrimination lawsuits. Even if you haven't technically done anything wrong, defending against a lawsuit can be expensive. If you cause your company to be on the receiving end of a lawsuit because you couldn't be bothered to be human enough to double-check why your AI was canning Janice in accounting, you'll be the next one being handed a pink slip. Don't do it. Just say no. I'm going to tell you a little secret. Journalists and writers do not exist solely to promote your company. We'd like to help, certainly. It feels good knowing we're helping folks grow their businesses. But, and you'll need to sit down for this news, there are other companies. We are also busy. I get thousands of emails every day. Hundreds of them are about the newest and by far most innovative AI company ever. Many of those pitches are AI-generated because the PR folks couldn't be bothered to take the time to focus their pitch. Some of them are so bad that I can't even tell what the PRs are trying to hawk. But then, there's the other side. Sometimes, I'll reach out to a company, willing to use my most valuable resource -- time -- on their behalf. When I get back a response that's AI-driven, I'll either move on to the next company (or mock them on social media). Also: 5 entry-level tech jobs AI is already augmenting, according to Amazon Some of those AI-driven answers are really, really inappropriate. However, because the AI is representing the company instead of, you know, maybe a thinking human, an opportunity is lost. Keep in mind that I don't like publishing things that will cost someone their job. But other writers are not necessarily similarly inclined. A properly run business will not only use a human to respond to the press, but will also limit the humans allowed to represent the company to those properly experienced in what to say. Or go ahead and cut corners. I always need fun fodder for my Facebook feed. Earlier, I wrote "9 programming tasks you shouldn't hand off to AI," which detailed programming tasks you should avoid passing along to an AI. I've long been nervous about ceding too much responsibility to an AI, and quite concerned about managing codebase maintenance. But I didn't really understand how far stupid could go when it came to delegating coding responsibility to the AI. I mean, yes, I know AIs can be stupid. And I sure know humans can be stupid. But when AIs and humans work in tandem to advance the cause of their stupidity together, the results can be truly awe-inspiring. In "Bad vibes: How an AI agent coded its way to disaster," my ZDNET colleague Steven Vaughan-Nichols wrote about a developer who happily vibe-coded himself to an almost-complete piece of software. First, the AI hard-coded lies about how unit tests performed. Then the AI deleted his entire codebase. It's not necessarily wrong to use AI to help you code. But if you're using a tool that can't be backed up, or you don't bother to back up your code first, you're simply doing your best to earn a digital Darwin award. Here's a lightning round of boneheaded moves using AI. They're just too good (and by good, I mean bad) not to recount: What about you? Have you seen an AI go off the rails at work? Have you ever been tempted to delegate a task to a chatbot that, in hindsight, probably needed a human touch? Do you trust AI to handle sensitive data, communicate with customers, or make decisions that affect people's lives? Where do you draw the line in your work? Let us know in the comments below.

US stock market futures dropped nearly 1% after President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on imports from 92 countries, triggering fresh concerns over inflation, trade retaliation, and supply chain disruptions. The move, which includes a sharp hike in tariffs on Canadian goods from 25% to 35%, rattled global markets and sent major indices like the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq lower. The sudden tariff escalation, paired with mixed earnings from Amazon and Apple and the looming U.S. jobs report, has heightened market uncertainty. Investors are now watching for ripple effects across sectors and global economies.

US stock market futures dropped nearly 1% after President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on imports from 92 countries, triggering fresh concerns over inflation, trade retaliation, and supply chain disruptions. The move, which includes a sharp hike in tariffs on Canadian goods from 25% to 35%, rattled global markets and sent major indices like the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq lower. The sudden tariff escalation, paired with mixed earnings from Amazon and Apple and the looming U.S. jobs report, has heightened market uncertainty. Investors are now watching for ripple effects across sectors and global economies.

Title: International Insider: C-Suite Reorgs Hit International; UK Agency Shakeup; Mubi Investor Spotlighted

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor Good afternoon Insiders, the summer holidays have arrived but it’s been a busy old week, and Max Goldbart is here to guide you through. After today, we’re going to take a little August break from both the International Insider newsletter and our Global Breakouts strand, but we will be back with you early September. In the meantime, our crack team will bring you the very latest news and analysis, day in, day out. For now, read on or sign up here. WBD & Paramount Reorgs Hit International Seismic shifts: We at Deadline International like to be on hand to tease out how major changes in the American media landscape impact international. What better week than when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) set out its post-split leadership team and the protracted Paramount-Skydance merger moved to its next phase. WBD is forging a streaming and studios Warner Bros. division under David Zaslav, which will be distinct from the Discovery Global networks division led by ex-WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels. International, for the most part, has moved under Wiedenfels, with ex-WBD Lat Am boss Fernando Medin taking on the President of International role and his sort-of predecessor Gerhard Zeiler effectively promoted to become President of Discovery Global in the U.S., UK and Germany. Yet the announcement was devoid of information about the Warner Bros. International TV Production studio, which has bases in multiple countries and makes some of Warner’s biggest unscripted hits around the world. Rather than being folded in with the rest of the American Warner studios, WBITVP will in fact become part of Discovery Global, we revealed Tuesday. There was speculation that there was a tussle between Warner Bros. and Discovery Global over where WBITVP would sit, but the latter ended up making the most sense due in part to WBITVP boss Ronald Goes’ relationship with Zeiler, who has a keen understanding of international production. So far, WBITVP employees are hopeful the split won’t lead to layoffs, which has been a concern for those working at rival Paramount’s international assets around the world as the $8.4B Paramount-Skydance merger completes. Staffers at Paramount-owned UK network Channel 5 are said to be “anxious” about what comes next. Deadline went deep to reveal more of these concerns. Change is coming in America, and as ever it’s spreading overseas. Related Stories Executives Jane Wiseman & Efrain Miron Poised To Join Cindy Holland At Paramount's DTC Unit - The Dish Executives Mike Ireland Exiting Role As Head Of Motion Picture Group At Paramount UK Agency Shakeup Watch on Deadline Exodus: Big shakeup in the UK agenting space this week with a whopping four out of five partners at Hamilton Hodell moving to management firm B-Side. This represents a serious exodus of senior agents. Alexander Cooke, Madeleine Dewhirst, Christopher Farrar and Sian Smyth are all joining the leadership team at B-Side from today (August 1), taking huge stars including Naomi Ackie, Aaron Pierre, Daisy Edgar-Jones, Emilia Clarke, Sophie Wilde, Leo Woodall, Anthony Boyle, Lola Petticrew, Martin Compston and Camille Cottin with them. B-Side, which already reps the likes of Daniel Kaluuya and Barry Keoghan, is no stranger to ship-jumping, having been launched four years ago by four former Troika reps who kicked off with an impressive client list. The move is just the latest to shake up the ever-bustling UK agenting space, which has been alive and busy since the UTA acquisition of Curtis Brown. It provides a reminder of the power of British talent. For now, Hamilton Hodell stays strong with at least half a dozen agents remaining with mega talent such as Tilda Swinton, Ben Whishaw and Emma Thompson. “I’m very proud of my brilliant team of agents, associates and support staff at HH and we will continue to provide the very best representation for extraordinary talent,” said CEO Christian Hodell, who has been with the agency for more than three decades. Netflix ❤️ MBC You know what I MENA?: Big moves in the MENA region as Netflix continues its path to world aggregation domination with a landmark deal struck with the Middle East’s MBC Group. The deal, described as “innovative” by those closest to it, will see customers of MBCNOW – MBC’s recently launched entertainment service aggregator – given access to the full Netflix service, alongside MBC’s Shahid streaming channels and linear TV channels, in one subscription. Netflix already performs well in the region but simultaneously faces stiff competition from Shahid, so this feels a case of, ‘If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.’ The streamer has spent recent weeks unveiling these kinds of deal around the world, including the landmark TF1 tie-up, and so it appears that local aggregation now matters as much to Netflix as local commissioning. On the latter, Netflix yesterday unveiled a 10-strong slate in another priority region, Colombia, including a documentary about soccer superstar James Rodríguez. The streamer has pushed heavily into Latin American programming with the One Hundred Years of Solitude adaptation being its biggest effort out of Colombia to date. Can’t Escape YouTube Even the boomers love it: Ofcom’s Media Nations report spotlighting the UK TV industry’s previous 12 months always provides a bounty of talking points and this year all roads led to YouTube. The Google-owned behemoth is all the rage in TV circles and Media Nations unearthed research finding that YouTube is now the second most-watched service in the UK, behind only the BBC and ahead of the likes of ITV and Netflix. While young people no doubt love a bit of YouTube, interesting findings included a doubling of viewing from over-55s, most of which takes place on smart TV sets rather than phones. Half of the platform’s top-trending videos now more closely resemble traditional TV, including long-form interviews and game shows, Ofcom said. Chatter about how traditional broadcasters and super-indies can best leverage YouTube rather than bowing to its power will likely dominate over coming months. Upon the announcement of its half-year results, Big Brother super-producer Banijay Entertainment touted plans to “enhance our presence on YouTube specifically.” It’s not been all roses for YouTube this week, however, with Australia’s Prime Minister revealing he officially wants to include YouTube in the nation’s world-first social media ban for under 16s. Google, in response, has warned the Australian government that it could go down the legal route. Mubi Investor In Spotlight “Sometimes in life, you just gotta say no”: Mubi has in recent years nurtured a reputation for being an independent auteurs’ dream, but the distributor has been in the spotlight these past days for altogether different reasons. In fact, it has angered several such auteurs. On Wednesday, Mubi received pushback from a number of filmmakers with connections to the distributor – including Radu Jude, Sarah Friedland, Joshua Oppenheimer and Cherien Dabis – over a recent $100M investment it received from Silicon Valley-based private equity firm Sequoia Capital. The issue stems from Sequoia having backed a number of Israeli military technology companies since October 7. The filmmakers suggested these investments tied Mubi to the ongoing violence in Gaza, where more than 60,000 people are reported to have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military campaign. Things got worse for Mubi when one of the letter’s supporters, Eddie Huang, said Mubi had shelved his latest project over his criticism of ties to Sequoia. “I know I did the right thing,” said Huang. “I’m not gonna be gaslit into thinking I didn’t. Sometimes in life, you just gotta say no.” Responding, Mubi has said the Sequoia partnership is there “to accelerate” its “mission of delivering bold and visionary films to global audiences,” while noting Sequoia’s investments do “not reflect the views of Mubi.” The Essentials 🌶️ Hot One: The name’s Knight… Steven Knight has been set to pen the next James Bond movie, a “bucket list” achievement. 🌶️ Another One: Der Tiger has become the first Amazon MGM Studios Germany feature to land a local theatrical release. 🌶️ More: House of the Dragon S3 has cast Red Skies star Annie Shapero as fierce warrior Alysanne Blackwood. 🪓 Breaking Baz: Gurinder Chadha is penning a sequel to 1990s cult hit Bend it Like Beckham. 🫵 Accused: Christopher Nolan has been criticized for shooting elements of all-star epic The Odyssey in the Morocco-occupied Western Sahara. 📊 Results: In half-year earnings week, Canal+ revenue fell 3.3%, TF1 was helped along by its North American studio and ProSiebenSat. 1 was hit by economic uncertainty. 🚪 Exiting: Good Morning Britain U.S. correspondent Noel Phillips amid job cuts. 🤝 Done deal: My Octopus Teacher maker Off the Fence has been rescued from bankruptcy by Insight TV. 🏆Oscars: The International feature contest 2026 is ago with Turkey’s One of the Days When Hemme Dies from Murat Fıratoğlu. 🤖 Robots are coming: Korea’s Culture Minister nominee said he wants to better integrate AI technology into the industry. 🏕️ Festival latest: Pedro Almodóvar collaborator Esther García will be feted at San Sebastian. 🍿 Box office: Sara told us Indian Box Office hit Saiyaara has defied the odds to become the second highest-grossing Indian film of the year. 🎥 Trailer: For The Birthday Party, the Willem Dafoe-led drama headed to Locarno.

Title: The Making of Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei

Time Published: 2025-08-01T11:06:13Z

CMSWire's Marketing & Customer Experience Leadership channel is the go-to hub for actionable research, editorial and opinion for CMOs, aspiring CMOs and today's customer experience innovators. Our dedicated editorial and research teams focus on bringing you the data and information you need to navigate today's complex customer, organizational and technical landscapes. We've got you covered. Dario Amodei doesn’t hesitate when I ask what’s gotten into him. The Anthropic CEO has spent 2025 at war, feuding with industry counterparts, members of the government, and the public’s perception of artificial intelligence. In recent months, he’s predicted that AI could soon eliminate 50% of entry-level, white-collar jobs. He’s railed against a ten-year AI regulation moratorium in the pages of the New York Times. And he’s called for semiconductor export controls to China, drawing a public rebuke from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Amid it all, Amodei meets me on the first floor of his company’s downtown San Francisco headquarters. He’s loose, energetic, and anxious to get started, as if he’s been waiting for this moment to address his actions. Sporting a blue shawl-collar sweater over a casual white t-shirt, and boxy thick-rimmed glasses, he sits down and stares ahead. Underlying his efforts, Amodei says, is a firm belief that AI is moving faster than most of us appreciate, making its opportunities and consequences much closer than they appear. “I am indeed one of the most bullish about AI capabilities improving very fast,” he tells me. “As we've gotten more close to AI systems that are more powerful, I've wanted to say those things more forcefully, more publicly, to make the point clearer.” Amodei’s outspokenness and sharp elbows have earned him both respect and derision in Silicon Valley. He’s seen by some as a technological visionary who pioneered OpenAI’s GPT-3 project (the seeds of ChatGPT) and a safety-minded leader who broke off and founded Anthropic. Others see him as a control-oriented “doomer” who wants to slow AI progress, shape it to his liking, and shut out the competition. Love him or hate him, the AI field will have to deal with him. Amodei has turned Anthropic, currently valued at $61 billion, into an economic force. From a zero start in 2021, the company — though still unprofitable — has grown its annualized recurring revenue from $1.4 billion in March 2025 to $3 billion in May to nearly $4.5 billion in July, leading Amodei to call it the “fastest growing software company in history at the scale that it's at.” Perhaps more notable than Anthropic’s revenue is the way it’s coming in. Rather than relying primarily on applications like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Amodei’s biggest bet is on the underlying technology itself. Most of the company’s revenue, Amodei tells me, is earned via its API, or through other companies buying Anthropic’s AI models and using them within their own products. Anthropic will thus be a barometer of AI’s progress, rising and falling on the strength of the technology. As Anthropic grows, Amodei hopes its heft will help him influence the industry’s direction. And given his willingness to speak out, throw a punch, and take one, he’s probably right. So if this man will steer what may be the world’s most influential new technology, it’s worth understanding what drives him, his business, and why his timeline is shorter than so many others’. And after more than two dozen interviews with him, his friends, colleagues, and competitors, I believe I have an answer. Dario Amodei was a science kid. Born in San Francisco in 1983 to a Jewish mother and an Italian father, he was interested almost entirely in math and physics. When the dot-com boom exploded around him in his high school years, it barely registered. “Writing some website actually had no interest to me whatsoever,” he tells me. “I was interested in discovering fundamental scientific truth.” At home, Amodei was very close with his parents, a loving couple who he says sought to improve the world. His mother Elena Engel ran renovation and construction projects for libraries in Berkeley and San Francisco. His father Riccardo Amodei was a trained leathersmith. “They gave me a sense of right and wrong and what was important in the world,” he says, “imbuing a strong sense of responsibility.” That sense of responsibility showed up in Amodei’s undergrad years at Caltech, where he lambasted his fellow students over their passivity toward the forthcoming Iraq war. “The problem isn't that everyone is just peachy with the idea of bombing Iraq; it's that most people are opposed in principle but refuse to give one millisecond of their time,” Amodei wrote in The California Tech, a student newspaper, on March 3, 2003. “This needs to change, right now and without delay.” Then, in his early 20s, Amodei’s life changed forever. His father Riccardo, who’d long fought a rare illness, lost the battle in 2006. Riccardo’s passing shocked Amodei, and he shifted his graduate studies at Princeton from theoretical physics to biology to address human illness and biological problems. The rest of Amodei’s life has, in some ways, been dedicated to addressing his father’s loss, especially because within four years, a new breakthrough turned the illness from something that was 50% fatal to 95% curable. “There was someone who worked on the cure to this disease, that managed to cure it, and save a bunch of people's lives,” Amodei says, “but could have saved even more.” “I get really angry when someone's like, “This guy's a doomer. He wants to slow things down’” - Dario Amodei Amodei’s father’s passing has shaped his life’s path to this day, says Jade Wang, who dated him in the early 2010s. “It's the difference between his father most likely dying and most likely living, okay?,” she says, explaining that had scientific progress sped up a bit, Amodei’s father might still be with us. It just took a while before he found AI as a vessel to do it. Upon recalling his father’s death, Amodei grows animated. His calls for export controls and AI safeguards, he believes, have been mischaracterized as the actions of someone irrationally seeking to impede AI progress. “I get really angry when someone's like, ‘This guy's a doomer. He wants to slow things down,’” Amodei tells me. “You heard what I just said, my father died because of cures that could have happened a few years [earlier]. I understand the benefit of this technology.” At Princeton, still raw from his father’s loss, Amodei began his quest to decode human biology by studying the retina. Our eyes capture the world by sending signals to the visual cortex — a large part of the brain that takes up 30% of the cerebral cortex — which then processes the data and shows us a picture. If you’re looking to tackle the complexity of the human physiology, the retina is a great place to start. “He used the retina to look at a complete neural population and actually understand what every cell was doing, or at least have that opportunity,” Stephanie Palmer, one of Amodei’s contemporaries at Princeton, tells me. “It was about that more than the eye. He wasn't trying to be an ophthalmologist.” Working in Professor Michael Berry’s retina lab, Amodei was so dissatisfied with the methods available to measure the retina’s signals that he co-invented a new, better sensor to pick up more data. This was atypical for the lab, at once impressive and nonconformist. His dissertation won the Hertz Thesis Prize, a prestigious award granted to those who discover real-world applications in their academic work. But Amodei’s penchant for poking at norms, and his strident sense of the way things should be, set him apart in an academic setting. Berry tells me that Amodei was the most talented graduate student he ever had, but his focus on technological progress and teamwork didn’t play well in a system built to recognize individual achievement. “I think internally, he was kind of a proud person,” Berry tells me. “I imagine his whole academic career up until that point, whenever he did something, people would stand up and clap. And that was not really happening here.” “He wasn't trying to be an ophthalmologist.” - Stephanie Palmer When Amodei left Princeton, the door to AI opened. He began postdoc work under researcher Parag Mallick at Stanford, studying proteins in and around tumors to detect metastatic cancer cells. The work was complex, showing Amodei the limits of what people could do alone, and he started looking for technological solutions. “The complexity of the underlying problems in biology felt like it was beyond human scale,” Amodei tells me. “In order to understand it all, you needed hundreds, thousands of human researchers.” Amodei saw that potential in emerging AI technologies. At the time, an explosion of data and computing power was sparking breakthroughs in machine learning, a subset of AI that long held theoretical potential but had shown middling results until then. After Amodei began experimenting with the technology, he realized it might eventually stand in for those thousands of researchers. “AI, which I was just starting to see the discoveries in, felt to me like the only technology that could kind of bridge that gap,” he says, something that “could bring us beyond human scale.” Amodei left academia to pursue AI advancement in the corporate world, which had the cash to support it. He considered founding a startup, then leaned toward Google, which had a well-funded AI research division in Google Brain and just acquired DeepMind. But Chinese search engine Baidu had handed the esteemed researcher Andrew Ng a $100 million budget to research and deploy AI, and he began to form a superteam. Ng reached out to Amodei, who was intrigued and applied. When Amodei’s application arrived at Baidu, the full team didn't know what to do with it. “He had an impressive background, but his background, from our perspective, was in biology. It was not in machine learning,” Greg Diamos, an early member of the team, tells me. Diamos then looked at Amodei’s code from Stanford, and encouraged the team to hire him. “I was thinking, anyone who can write this has got to be an amazingly good programmer,” he says. Amodei joined Baidu in November 2014. Related Article: Unveiling the Past and Future of Generative AI With their vast resources, the Baidu team could throw computing power and data at problems in an attempt to improve their outcomes. They saw remarkable results. In their experiments, Amodei and his colleagues found that AI’s performance improved meaningfully as they added more of these ingredients. The team released a paper on speech recognition that showed that model size directly correlated with performance. “It had a big impact on me, because I saw these very smooth trends,” Amodei says. Amodei’s early work at Baidu contributed to what’s known as the AI “scaling laws,” which are really more of an observation. The scaling laws state that increasing computing power, data, and model size in AI training leads to predictable performance improvements. Scaling everything up, in other words, makes AI better, no novel methods needed. “This was, to me, the most significant discovery I've seen in my life,” Diamos tells me. How different scaling factors improve model performance, based on early experiments by Amodei and peers. To this day, Amodei is perhaps the purest believer in the scaling laws among AI research leaders. While peers like Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Meta Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun suggest the AI industry needs further breakthroughs to reach human-level artificial intelligence, Amodei speaks with a certainty — though not complete — that the path forward is clear. And as the industry erects massive data centers the size of small cities, he sees exceptionally powerful AI fast approaching. “I see this exponential,” he says. “When you're on an exponential, you can really get fooled by it. Two years away from when the exponential goes totally crazy it looks like it's just starting.” At Baidu, the AI team’s progress became seeds of its undoing. Turf battles broke out within the company over control of its increasingly valuable technology, know-how, and resources. Eventually, meddling from powerbrokers in China sparked a talent exodus and the lab fell apart. Andrew Ng declined to comment. As Baidu’s AI team crumbled, Elon Musk invited Amodei and a number of leading AI researchers to a now-famous dinner at the Rosewood hotel in Menlo Park. Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and Ilya Sutskever all attended. Seeing AI’s emerging potential, and concerned Google could solidify control over it, Musk decided to fund a new competitor, which became OpenAI. Altman, Brockman, and Sutskever co-founded the new research house with Musk. Amodei thought about joining, felt unsure about the fledgling organization, and went to Google Brain instead. After ten months stuck in large-company morass at Google, Amodei reconsidered. He joined OpenAI in 2016, and got to work on AI safety. He’d grown interested in safety at Google, where he worried about the rapidly improving technology’s capacity for harm and co-authored a paper on its potential for bad behavior. As Amodei settled in at OpenAI, his former Google colleagues introduced the transformer model, the technology behind today’s generative AI moment, in a paper called “Attention is All You Need.” The transformer enabled faster training and much larger models than prior methods. Despite the discovery’s great potential, Google mostly sat on it. OpenAI, meanwhile, got to work. It released its first large language model called “GPT” (the “T” stands for transformer) in 2018. The model generated often-broken text but still demonstrated meaningful improvement over previous language generation methods. Amodei, who’d become a research director at OpenAI, got directly involved in the next iteration, GPT-2, which was effectively the same model as GPT, just bigger. The OpenAI team fine-tuned GPT-2 with a technique called reinforcement learning with human feedback, something Amodei helped pioneer, which helped guide its values. GPT-2 delivered much better results than GPT, as expected, showing an ability to paraphrase, write, and answer questions somewhat coherently. Language models soon became the focal point at OpenAI. As Amodei’s profile increased within OpenAI, so did the controversy around him. A prolific writer, he’d produce long documents about values and technology, which some colleagues saw as inspirational but others saw as flag planting and heavy handed. (One such memo: an exploration of “M” companies vs. “P” companies, where Ms provide market-focused goods and Ps provide public-focused goods). Amodei, to some, was also too focused on maintaining secrecy around the technology’s potential and collaborating with the government to address it. And he could be a bit abrasive, sometimes disparaging projects he didn’t believe in. OpenAI still entrusted Amodei with the leadership of the GPT-3 project, handing him 50-60% of the entire company’s compute to build a massively scaled up version of its language model. The jump from GPT to GPT-2 was large, a ten-fold increase. But the jump from GPT-2 to GPT-3 would be massive, a 100x project costing tens of millions of dollars. The results were stunning. The New York Times quoted independent researchers surprised by the GPT-3’s ability to code, summarize, and translate. Amodei, who was relatively restrained upon the release of GPT-2, gushed about his new model. “It has this emergent quality,” hed told the Times. “It has some ability to recognize the pattern that you gave it and complete the story.” But cracks beneath the surface at OpenAI began to tear wide open. With the creation of GPT-3, the first capable language model, the stakes for Amodei increased. After seeing the scaling laws work in multiple disciplines at this point, Amodei considered where the technology was headed and developed an even greater interest in safety. “He looked at this technology and assumed it would work,” Jack Clark, a close colleague of Amodei’s at OpenAI, tells me. “And if you assume it works, in the sense that it's going to be as smart as a person, you can't help but be concerned of the safety things in some sense.” Though Amodei led OpenAI’s model development, and directed a good chunk of its compute, parts of the company were out of his hands. This included deciding when to release models, personnel matters, how the company deploys its technology, and how it represents itself externally. “Many of those things,” Amodei says, “are not things that you control just by training the models.” Amodei, by then, had formed a tight-knit group of coworkers around him — which some called “the pandas,” due to his love of the animal — and had very different ideas from OpenAI leadership about how to handle these functions. Infighting ensued, and the factions developed an intense dislike for each other. “He believes that AI is so scary that only they should do it” - Jensen Huang In our conversation, Amodei didn’t mask his feelings. “The leaders of a company, they have to be trustworthy people,” he says. “They have to be people whose motivations are sincere, no matter how much you're driving forward the company technically. If you're working for someone whose motivations are not sincere, who's not an honest person, who does not truly want to make the world better, it's not going to work. You're just contributing to something bad.” Within OpenAI, some saw Amodei’s focus on safety as a route to control the company altogether. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently echoed these criticisms after Amodei called for GPU export controls to China. “He believes that AI is so scary that only they should do it,” Huang said. “That's the most outrageous lie I've ever heard,” Amodei tells me of Huang’s claim, adding he’s always wanted to spark a ‘race to the top’ by encouraging others to emulate Anthropic’s safety practices. “I’ve said nothing that anywhere near resembles the idea that this company should be the only one to build the technology. I don't know how anyone could ever derive that from anything that I've said. It’s just an incredible and bad faith distortion.” My full conversation with Amodei will be live on Big Technology Podcast. You can subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or your app of choice. Nvidia, which just won a rollback of some of Amodei’s favored export controls, doubled down. "We support safe, responsible, and transparent AI. Thousands of startups and developers in our ecosystem and the open-source community are enhancing safety,” an Nvidia spokesperson tells me. “Lobbying for regulatory capture against open source will only stifle innovation, make AI less safe and secure, and less democratic. That's not a 'race to the top' or the way for America to win." OpenAI hit back as well, via a company spokesperson. “We’ve always believed that AI should benefit and empower everyone, not just those who say it’s too risky for anyone but themselves to develop safely,” the spokesperson says. “As the technology has evolved, our decisions on partnerships, model releases, and funding have become standard across the industry, including at Anthropic. What hasn’t changed is our focus on making AI safe, useful, and available to as many people as possible.” Over time, the differences between Amodei’s group and OpenAI’s leaders became so untenable that something had to give. “Fifty percent of our time was spent trying to convince other people of views that we held, and fifty percent was spent working,” Clark says. So in December 2020, Amodei, Clark, Amodei’s sister Daniela, researcher Chris Olah, and a handful of others departed OpenAI to start something new. In a conference room within Anthropic offices, Clark turns around his laptop and displays one of Anthropic’s earliest documents. It’s a list of names including Aligned AI, Generative, Sponge, Swan, Sloth, and Sparrow Systems. Anthropic, a word that connotes being human centered and human oriented, is also there, and it also happened to be an available domain name in early 2021. “We like the name it is good,” the team wrote in the spreadsheet. And thus, Anthropic was born. Anthropic was formed in the heart of Covid, meeting entirely on Zoom amid the pandemic’s second wave. Eventually, its 15 to 20 employees would meet for weekly lunches in San Francisco’s Precita Park, pulling up their own chairs to talk business. The company’s early mission was simple: Build leading large language models, implement safe practices to pressure others to follow, and publish what it learned, apart from its models’ core technical details. It might sound odd that the group of less than two dozen people meeting in a park with their own chairs would feel a sense of destiny, especially since they’d need billions of dollars to see their mission through, but that was the vibe in Anthropic’s early days. “The strangest thing about all of this is how inevitable so much of it felt to people on the inside,” Clark says. “We've done scaling laws. We could see the path to the models getting good.” Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt was among Anthropic’s first investors. He’d met Amodei through his then-girlfriend and now wife, who Schmidt knew socially. The two talked technology when Amodei was still at OpenAI, and business when he started Anthropic. Schmidt tells me he invested in the person more than the concept. “At this level, when you're doing an investment like that, you have essentially no data, right?” he says. “You don't know what the revenue is. You don't know the market. You don't know what the product is. And so you fundamentally have to decide based on the people. And Dario is a brilliant scientist, and he promised to hire brilliant scientists, which he did. He promised to lead a very small company doing it, which he did not. Now it's a very large company, and now it's a normal company. I figured it would be a very interesting research lab.” Now-disgraced FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was also among Anthropic’s early investors, directing a reported $500 million from FTX’s coffers for a 13.56% stake in the company. Bankman-Fried was one of a number of effective altruists who invested in Anthropic’s early stages, when the movement and company were close. Amodei says SBF was an AI bull interested in safety, a good fit, but had sufficient red flags to keep him off the board and give him non-voting shares. SBF’s behavior, Amodei says, “turned out to be much, much, much more extreme and bad than I ever imagined.” Amodei’s pitch to prospective investors was simple: He told them Anthropic had the talent to build cutting-edge models at a tenth of the cost. And it worked. To date, Amodei’s brought in nearly $20 billion, including $8 billion from Amazon and $3 billion from Google. “Investors aren't idiots,” he tells me. “They basically understand the concept of capital efficiency.” In Anthropic’s second year, OpenAI introduced generative AI to the world with ChatGPT, but Anthropic took a different path. Rather than focus on consumer applications, Amodei decided Anthropic would sell its technology to businesses. There were two benefits to this strategy. If the models were useful it could be lucrative, and the challenge would prod the company into building better technology. Improving an AI model from undergrad to graduate level in biochemistry might not excite the common chatbot user, Amodei says, but it would be valuable to a pharmaceutical company like Pfizer. “It gives a better incentive to develop the models as far as possible,” he says. Oddly enough, it was an Anthropic consumer product that got businesses to pay attention to its technology. The company released its Claude chatbot in July 2023, nearly a year after ChatGPT’s debut, and it drew rave reviews due to its high-EQ personality (an outgrowth of Anthropic’s safety work). The company, until then, had sought to remain under 150 employees, but soon found itself hiring more people in a day than it employed in total in its entire first year. “It was that Claude chatbot moment when the company started to grow a lot,” Clark says. Amodei’s bet on building AI for business use cases attracted loads of eager customers. Anthropic’s now sold its large language models across multiple industries — travel, healthcare, financial services, insurance, and more — including to leaders like Pfizer, United Airlines, and AIG. The Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk is, for instance, using Anthropic to condense a fifteen-day regulatory report compilation process into ten minutes.

Coders, meanwhile, have fallen in love with Anthropic. The company focused on AI code generation both because it could help speed its model development and because coders would adopt it quickly if it worked well enough. Sure enough, the use cases exploded and have coincided with — or caused — the rise of AI coding tools like Cursor. Anthropic is also getting into the coding application business itself. It released Claude Code, an AI coding tool, in February 2025. As AI usage booms, the company’s revenue is as well. “Anthropic’s revenue every year has grown 10x,” Amodei says. “We went from zero to $100 million in 2023. We went from $100 million to a billion in 2024. And this year, in this first half of the year, we've gone from $1 billion to I think, as of speaking today, it’s well above $4 [billion], it might be $4.5 [billion].” The last figure is annualized, or 12x the month’s revenue. Anthropic’s 8 and 9 figure deals have tripled in 2025 vs. 2024, the company says, and its business customers have spent 5x more on average. But Anthropic is spending a lot of money to train and run its models, raising questions about whether its business model is sustainable. The company is deeply unprofitable, expected to lose about $3 billion this year. And its gross margins have also reportedly lagged behind typical cloud software companies. Some of Anthropic’s customers are wondering if the company’s attempt to sort out its business is showing up in the product. One startup founder told me that while Anthropic is the best model for his use case, he can’t rely on it because it’s down too often. Amjad Masad, CEO of vibe coding company Replit, told me the cost to use its models has stopped coming down after a period of price decreases. Claude Code also just added additional rate limits after some developers used it so much it became bad business. Entrepreneur and developer Kieran Klaassen tells me that he got $6,000 worth of Claude API usage in one month for just the $200 Max subscription price. Klaassen says he’s run multiple Claude agents at a time. “The real limit comes in your mental capacity to switch from one to the other,” he says. Amodei says that as Anthropic’s models improve, customers will get a better deal if costs stay the same, effectively buying more intelligence per dollar. He also says that AI labs are just beginning to optimize for inference, or the act of using the models, which should lead to efficiency improvements. This is a place to pay attention. Multiple industry sources told me inference costs must drop for the business to make sense. Anthropic’s executives, in their interviews with me, suggest there are worse problems than high demand for your product. The open question is whether generative AI, and the scaling laws that propel it, will neatly follow other technology’s cost reduction curves, or whether it’s a novel technology with a novel cost. The only sure thing is it’ll take a lot more money to find out. Related Articles: 5 Predictions for the AI Roadmap At the beginning of 2025, Anthropic needed cash. The AI industry’s hunger for scale had catalyzed massive data center buildouts and compute deals. To support these undertakings, AI labs had repeatedly smashed startup fundraising records. And established companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon used their sizable profits and data centers to build their own models, turning up the pressure. Anthropic has a special imperative to build large. Without a powerhouse application like ChatGPT, where users come back out of habit, its models must lead in their use cases or risk being swapped out for a competitor. “In the corporate space, and especially in coding, there’s very clearly an advantage to be six months or a year ahead of the state of the art,” Box CEO Aaron Levie, an Anthropic customer, tells me. So the company turned to Ravi Mhatre, a veteran venture capitalist and partner at Lightspeed Ventures, to lead a $3.5 billion funding round. Mhatre used to write $5 or $10-million checks, but the one he was readying to cut would be among his firm’s largest. “Amazon went public with a $400 million market cap,” he tells me. “$400 million! Think about that today.” The fundraise was proceeding as planned when a cheap, competing AI model dropped seemingly out of thin air. The Chinese hedge fund High Flyer released DeepSeek R1, an open-source, capable, and efficient reasoning model that it priced forty times lower than its peers. DeepSeek shocked the business world and had multi-trillion-dollar CEOs tweeting Wikipedia articles to calm shareholders. By the time DeepSeek arrived, Mhatre had completed a full projection of why the AI models themselves, not the chatbots of the world, would generate the most value. He concluded that creating artificial intelligence capable of knowledge work would allow companies to have revenue ten times what the large cloud platforms bring in, leading to a total potential market of $15 to 20 trillion. “So then you work backwards and just say, at $60 billion or $100 billion, could you get a venture-style return? You absolutely could,” he says. “Sometimes it's about how you size the markets top-down.” DeepSeek’s arrival suggested that open source, efficient, almost-as-good models could challenge the incumbents, but Amodei didn’t see it that way. His greatest concern, he says, is whether any new model is better than Anthropic’s. If you can download the model’s designs, you still need to set it up on a cloud service and run it, he says, which takes skill and money. Amodei delivered a version of this argument to Mhatre and his colleagues at Lightspeed as the DeepSeek story took off, convincing them that some of the model’s innovations could be improved with scale. That Monday, Nvidia stock dropped 17% as panicked investors fled the AI infrastructure trade. Amid the uncertainty, the VC made a decision. “I'm not going to tell you that it wasn't extraordinarily stressful,” Mhatre says. “That Monday, we wired $1 billion.” Six months after DeepSeek Monday, Anthropic is looking to scale up yet again. The company is in talks for a new funding round that could reach $5 billion which would double its valuation to $150 billion. The potential investors include some middle eastern Gulf states that Anthropic once seemed eager to steer clear of. But after raising nearly $20 billion from Google, Amazon, and VCs like Lightspeed, it’s running out of options for bigger checks. “I'm not going to tell you that it wasn't extraordinarily stressful. That Monday, we wired $1 billion.” - Ravi Mhatre Within Anthropic, Amodei has argued the Gulf states have $100 billion or more in capital to invest, and their cash would help Anthropic stay on the technology’s frontier. He seemed to reluctantly accept the idea of taking the money from dictators in an internal Slack message obtained by Wired. “Unfortunately,” he wrote. “I think ‘No bad person should ever benefit from our success’ is a pretty difficult principle to run a business on.” Speaking with Amodei makes me wonder how, or if, this race to improve AI will end. I imagine the models might eventually get so big, and so good, they commoditize. Or perhaps, as Amodei’s former colleague Ilya Sutskever once suggested, the endless drive to scale ends up covering the planet with solar panels and datacenters. There’s also another possibility, one AI believers don’t like to discuss: AI improvement plateaus, leading to a historic investor wipeout. At Anthropic’s first developer conference in May, I grab a seat a few rows from the stage and await Amodei’s appearance. The company’s packed The Midway — an airy arts and events venue in San Francisco’s Dogpatch neighborhood — with coders, press, and many of its now 1,000+ employees. There’s broad anticipation inside that Anthropic will release Claude 4, its latest, biggest model. Amodei takes the stage and introduces Claude 4. Instead of a flashy presentation, he picks up a handheld mic, makes the announcement, reads his notes from a laptop, and then turns the spotlight over to Anthropic product head Mike Krieger. The crowd seems into it. Amodei’s promise of what’s coming next, to me, is more notable than the model update itself. Throughout the day, he repeatedly mentions that AI development is speeding up, and that Anthropic’s next model releases will come faster. “I don't know exactly how much more frequent,” he says. “But the pace is increasing,” Anthropic, as Amodei’s told me, has been developing AI coding tools to speed up its model development. When I bring this up to Jared Kaplan, the company’s co-founder and chief scientist, he tells me it’s working. “Most engineers at Anthropic use AI to help them be more productive,” he says. “So it's definitely speeding us up quite a bit.” There’s a concept in AI theory called an intelligence explosion, where the model is able to make itself better and then — fffffoooooom — self-improves and become all mighty. Kaplan doesn’t dismiss the notion that an intelligence explosion might arrive via this method, or perhaps a human-assisted version. “It could be two or three years away. Could take longer. Could take much longer,” Kaplan says. “But when I say there’s a 50% chance of AI being able to do all the things that knowledge workers do, one of the things we do is train AI models.” “Maybe people like me won't really have much to do,” Kaplan continues. “It's more complicated than that. But we are quite likely headed towards the future that looks like that.” Amodei’s safety obsession, at this point, comes into clear focus. While nobody within Anthropic says an intelligence explosion is imminent, it’s evident they’re not shying away from moving toward it. If AI is going to get better, faster — and perhaps much faster — it’s worth being careful about its downsides. Some of this theoretical talk clearly helps Anthropic market its services to pharmaceutical companies and developers, but AI models are now coding well enough that it no longer feels completely insane. Jan Leike, the former head of OpenAI’s ‘Superalignment’ team, followed Amodei to Anthropic in 2024 to co-lead its alignment science team. Alignment is the art of tuning AI systems to ensure they are aligned with our values and goals. And Leike believes syncing the machines with our intentions will be crucial should we see the anticipated eruption. “There could be a period of rapid capability progress,” Leike tells me. “You don't want to lose control or lose scalability over a system that's recursively self-improving.” Already, Anthropic and its counterparts have found AI sometimes demonstrates a worrying interest in self-preservation while testing in simulation environments. In Claude 4’s documentation, for instance, Anthropic stated the model repeatedly attempted to blackmail an engineer to avoid being shut down. “You don't want to lose control or lose scalability over a system that's recursively self-improving.” - Jan Leike Anthropic’s also said its AI has worked to deceive evaluators when it thought they might rewrite its values. The model also attempted to copy itself out of Anthropic’s infrastructure in a simulation. Leike says Anthropic is working to discourage these behaviors via reward systems. The field is still experimental. Speaking openly about these issues is part of Amodei’s “race to the top” strategy. Anthropic’s also funded — and advocated for — interpretability, or the science of understanding what takes place within AI models. And it’s published a Responsible Scaling Policy, a framework that sets boundaries for when to release and train models depending on their risks, which has inspired similar efforts among its peers. “The way I think about the race to the top is that it doesn't matter who wins,” Amodei says. “Everyone wins, right?” Amodei’s dedication to AI, forged in the tragedy of his father’s loss, may now have its goal in sight. Today’s AI is already speeding up drug development paperwork, it’s become an (imperfect) medical advisor in a broken medical system, and, if things go right, it may one day stand in for those hundreds or thousands of researchers needed to understand human biology. Could Amodei’s pursuit of this vision, I ask, blind him to the risks of losing control of the technology? “That's not the way I think about it,” he says. “We've gotten better at controlling models with every model that we release. All these things go wrong, but you really have to stress test the models pretty hard.” Amodei sees this line of questioning as rooted in the slow-it-down doomerism he’s often accused of. His plan, contrary to the critics, is to accelerate. “The reason I'm warning about the risk is so that we don't have to slow down,” he says. “I have such an incredible understanding of the stakes. In terms of the benefits, in terms of what it can do, the lives that it can save. I've seen that personally.” Owen Lavine contributed reporting.

Title: Crypto startups raise $2.6bn in July: Here are the winners

About us Copy link Crypto startups are rolling in it. In July, 65 crypto projects raised over $2.6 billion in new investments to grow their businesses, according to DefiLlama. That brings the total amount raised by industry players to $13 billion so far this year, up from the $9.5 billion raised in total in 2024. Pitchbook expects crypto startups to double that figure to $18 billion in 2025. Here are the three crypto projects that raised the most money in July. Pump.fun raised $590 million in an initial coin offering at the beginning of July to, as it boldly proclaimed, “kill Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch” by transforming itself into a new type of social media platform. At a glance, the controversial memecoin generator token sale seems a grand success. Pump.fun’s ICO sold out in just 12 minutes, capping off one of the fastest and largest raises in recent crypto memory. However, the project sold 2 billion fewer tokens than it had originally planned. The project had previously said 150 billion PUMP tokens, out of a 330 billion total ICO allocation, would be offered to the public at $0.004 each. That implied a $600 million raise. But the live dashboard confirms just 148 billion tokens were sold, pulling in $590 million — about 98% of the originally stated public allocation. The sale came in the same month as the platform is struggling with plummeting revenue amid a memecoin slump and an increasingly crowded market. And those traditional social media platforms? Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, saw its stock price surge 11% this week, giving it a market cap of just under $2 trillion, about half of the entire cryptocurrency market. Hong Kong-based OSL Group said it has secured $300 million in equity financing. “The funding will accelerate our global buildout — particularly in regulated payment infrastructure and access points,” Ivan Wong, CFO at OSL Group, said in a statement. Upexi, a Solana treasury company, announced a $200 million deal led by Big Brain Holdings at the beginning of July. The deal took the form of a convertible note offering, and the proceeds will be used to buy more Solana, the company said. Upexi is part of a wave of crypto treasury companies that have cropped up over the past year. While the bulk of them copy Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-buying strategy, many are also allocating resources to buying altcoins.
