Title: While private equity firms own 40% of SATS Ltd. (SGX:S58), individual investors are its largest shareholders with 49% ownership

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significant control over SATS by individual investors implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions 50% of the business is held by the top 21 shareholders 11% of SATS is held by Institutions A look at the shareholders of SATS Ltd. (SGX:S58) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual investors with 49% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Meanwhile, private equity firms make up 40% of the company’s shareholders. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of SATS, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for SATS Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that SATS does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of SATS, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in SATS. Our data shows that Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited is the largest shareholder with 40% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are BlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 2.2%. A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that SATS Ltd. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around S$19m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 49% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. Private equity firms hold a 40% stake in SATS. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand SATS better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for SATS that you should be aware of. Ultimately the future is most important.

Title: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says she doesn’t take lobbyist cash. Records tell a different story

Mountain View By Robert Schmad, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has repeatedly claimed that she won’t accept funds from lobbyists. Campaign finance records, however, show she has received nearly 100 separate donations from registered lobbyists since taking office. Ocasio-Cortez’s account description on X states that the congresswoman is “people-funded” and “takes no lobbyist [cash],” using a money bag emoji in place of the word “cash.” Despite her claim to the contrary, the representative has taken thousands of dollars in contributions from lobbyists since assuming office, according to federal records. The congresswoman has an extensive record decrying the influence of money on politics. In 2018, shortly after winning office for the first time, Ocasio-Cortez criticized her party’s “refusal to reject [corporate] lobbyist money.” Since then, she has called to ban members of Congress from working as lobbyists after leaving office, rebuked fellow Democrats for their close ties to lobbyists, and accused lobbyists of working to kill legislation that would benefit the public. While Ocasio-Cortez has harsh words for lobbyists, she has accepted donations from them every year since she first took office in 2018. Dave Koshgarian, a lobbyist with Ernst & Young, has been Ocasio-Cortez’s most consistent donor, sending her thousands of dollars beginning in 2020. Koshgarian has represented a number of corporate clients, including Duke Energy, MetLife, General Electric, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock, according to lobbying disclosures. Other clients represented by Ocasio-Cortez’s lobbyist donors include , among others, Nike, Delta Air Lines, healthcare trade associations, and the New Venture Fund , one arm of a massive Democratic-aligned dark money network managed by the Arabella Advisors consulting firm. Ocasio-Cortez has also been critical of the presence of dark money, funds that filter into the ideological causes without a clear original donor, in politics. She has argued that dark money groups sway the Supreme Court and unethically influence policy development. Ocasio-Cortez’s claim that she doesn’t take donations from lobbyists isn’t new, as the representative insists on social media that she swore off lobbyist cash from the very beginning. Cortez has, however, dialed down her public criticism of the lobbying industry in recent years, not making a single post on X with the words “lobby,” “lobbyist,” or “lobbying” since September 2022. The Washington Examiner reported in April 2023 that one of TikTok’s top lobbyists sat on the board of directors of a nonprofit group advised by Ocasio-Cortez. The congresswoman vigorously fought against proposed bans on the Chinese social media platform at the time, arguing that the United States shouldn’t ban TikTok but should instead impose blanket protections against data harvesting. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER “This is how corporate lobbying works,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote in May 2019. “Lobbyists ID bills they need to kill to keep profits high (no matter the human cost), come up w/ ‘sensible’ talking points to mask intent + say policy is ‘misguided,’ then schmooze policymakers in secret into accepting said talking points.” Ocasio-Cortez’s office did not respond to the Washington Examiner’s request for comment. Mike Davis, an ally of President-elect Donald Trump, warned New York Attorney General Letitia James to not pursue any legal action against Trump during his second term, threatening to send her to prison if she does so. “I dare you to try to continue your lawfare against President Trump in his second term,” Davis said […] Chaos broke out in a Manhattan courtroom after former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani lashed out at the judge over defamation payments to two Georgia election workers. Manhattan Judge Lewis Liman ruled last month that Giuliani must hand over his Manhattan apartment and a slew of personal luxury items in order to pay the nearly $150 […] The best news about President-elect Donald Trump returning to office is that we will again have a president who treats Mexico with the hostility it deserves; because the Mexican government is not an ally of the United States.

Dolly may not like talking politics, but her sister doesn't seem to mind it. The Queen of Country Music, Dolly Parton has managed to avoid alienating fans over politics by simply not discussing it. She's turned down the Presidential Medal of Freedom from presidents of both parties to avoid the appearance of picking a side, and has said in the past that she sees both sides of the issue and wants to avoid turning off her fans by jumping into the political mud: “Don’t get so trapped where if you’re a Republican, you got to be this way, if... Melania Trump was the keynote speaker at a naturalisation ceremony in Washington, DC, where she spoke about the "harsh realities" of trying to become a US citizen Sean Hannity, the influential television personality known for his show on Fox News, has had quite the journey from his humble beginnings to becoming a household name in media. Robert De Niro, the renowned actor known for his candid views on politics and societal issues, has expressed his deep frustration with the current state of affairs in America. In a heartfelt statement, De Niro has revealed his plans to leave the country, citing a lack of respect as one of the main reasons behind this decision.

Had Donald Trump been able to purchase the Buffalo Bills the course of history may have changed, according to Stephen A. Smith.

This change can make a big difference in the amount of money people who are 67 years or older make each month. A Democratic megadonor has said the Harris campaign’s $1.5 billion spending spree should disqualify the vice president “forever.” John Morgan argued that those who donated to the Harris campaign were attempting to beat Trump, not elect the vice president, adding that the massive spending by the campaign should worry Democrats. “All of a sudden, everybody’s got the keys to the candy store, ad buyers, talent consultants,” Morgan told NewsNation on Monday night. “There’s 100 days to do it, and the money started pouring in.” The attorney claimed that “ego” and a craving to get commissions on placed ads motivated...

Reid cited Trump's decision to nominate Project 2025 architect Russ Vought, who has called to deploy the military inside the country. Greene called Reid's program "an absolute clown show."

And analysts warn that President-elect Donald Trump is likely to inherit this headache too. The metal is not gold, silver, or uranium. It’s not the lithium used for EV batteries. It’s not the copper that is essential for electrification. It’s not even the rare earth elements that are crucial for everything from smartphones to wind turbines. This metal has a global annual production of less than 100,000 tons – a small fraction of the lead, copper, and iron produced every year. But it is a vital component in everything from armor-piercing bullets, nuclear weapons, explosive missiles to fire retardants in electronics and military uniforms. Most importantly, there are no viable alternatives at the moment. But one forward-looking company, Military Metals Corp. (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF), has recently purchased historically-proven deposits that could swiftly address America's most pressing resource vulnerability in recent times. The metal we’re talking about is antimony, and its scarcity has Western governments rattled.Military Metals CEO Scott Eldridge sees a major antimony supply crunch coming. And antimony prices this year, along with new Chinese restrictions add extra support to that prediction with prices tripling since earlier this year from $12,000 per ton to $38,000. That’s why the company acquired past-producing antimony mines on two continents at breakneck speed. But first, let’s zoom in on antimony demand, and prices, and why they are going through the roof right now. The Global Antimony Supply Squeeze The current crisis stems from China’s dominance in both global antimony production and refining. China, Russia, and Tajikistan control 85% of the world’s antimony supply. Antimony is not easy to extract and it’s often a by-product in the extraction of other metals like gold, silver, or copper. And China, which also currently controls 65% of global antimony refining capacity, has just imposed troubling new restrictions on its export. Because China controls most of the world’s antimony, when they cut supply Western military supply chains are directly impacted. According to a recent article published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C., the U.S. only has 20 days’ worth of antimony inventory. Germany has just 2 days’ worth of munitions supply. And geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, the Middle East, Afghanistan, and other places continue to aggravate the demand for antimony. So, antimony demand from defense is at record highs right now, and it’s only going to increase exponentially in the years to come. Washington's $1.8 Billion Antimony Push All these factors have together pushed antimony prices past $38,000 per ton – a 300% price increase in just the last 24 months. And this might just be the start! Understandably, political support for securing critical mineral supply chains across the globe is intensifying. Major economies like the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Japan, Australia, the European Union, and South Korea have all classified antimony as a “critical mineral.” And the U.S. government is keen on backing domestic antimony projects to reduce dependence on Chinese imports. As a part of that initiative, Perpetua Resources Corp., a mining company focused on developing gold-antimony deposits in the Stibnite district of Idaho, is securing a $1.8B loan from U.S. Export-Import Bank, along with an additional $60M from the Department of Defense. As a result, Perpetua’s stock has shot up over 400% since March this year. But this rapid surge is just one example of the antimony sector's explosive potential. Now, Military Metals Corp (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF), an under-the-radar company with premium assets in friendly NATO territory is positioning itself for even bigger success...The company recently announced that it has purchased one of Europe’s largest antimony deposits in Slovakia. The flagship Trojarova property here features a historical Soviet-era resource of 61,998.4 tonnes of antimony which has a in-situ value of over $2 billion of antimony in the ground at today’s spot prices. Located just 30 minutes from Bratislava with excellent infrastructure, the company thinks they can fast-track this project with a resource estimate within 6 months. Then there’s the Tienesgrund property, also in Slovakia, which covers 13.38 km² and encompasses 40-50 historical mining tunnels dating back to 1840. Historical Soviet-era work estimated 162t with an average grade of 7.7% antimony here, and the company expects to establish a resource within 12 months. Their West Gore property in Nova Scotia, which was one of Canada's largest antimony producers during World War I still holds significant unmined material. Historical ore extracts showed as high as 46% antimony content. Lastly, their Bear Creek property in Slovakia is a historical high-grade tin resource. The company got this project as a part of their Slovakia deal, but they’re thinking of divesting this to get money for their antimony projects. Key Factors Driving Military Metals Corp.’s Story At this critical point in the antimony market, Military Metals Corp. stands out for five key reasons... To sum up, as global demand for antimony continues to rise and geopolitical tensions persist, securing stable supplies outside of China’s control remains a key challenge for Western nations. 8 bonus stocks to keep an eye on: Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. As U.S. President Biden nears the end of his term, there’s one little-known metal whose scarcity is keeping him up at night even today. And analysts warn that President-elect Donald Trump is likely to inherit this headache too. The metal is not gold, silver, or uranium. It’s not the lithium used for EV batteries. It’s not the copper that is essential for electrification. It’s not even the rare earth elements that are crucial for everything from smartphones to wind turbines. This metal has a global annual production of less than 100,000 tons – a small fraction of the lead, copper, and iron produced every year. But it is a vital component in everything from armor-piercing bullets, nuclear weapons, explosive missiles to fire retardants in electronics and military uniforms. Most importantly, there are no viable alternatives at the moment. But one forward-looking company, Military Metals Corp. (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF), has recently purchased historically-proven deposits that could swiftly address America's most pressing resource vulnerability in recent times. The metal we’re talking about is antimony, and its scarcity has Western governments rattled. Military Metals CEO Scott Eldridge sees a major antimony supply crunch coming. And antimony prices this year, along with new Chinese restrictions add extra support to that prediction with prices tripling since earlier this year from $12,000 per ton to $38,000. That’s why the company acquired past-producing antimony mines on two continents at breakneck speed. But first, let’s zoom in on antimony demand, and prices, and why they are going through the roof right now.

And China, which also currently controls 65% of global antimony refining capacity, has just imposed troubling new restrictions on its export. Because China controls most of the world’s antimony, when they cut supply Western military supply chains are directly impacted. According to a recent article published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C., the U.S. only has 20 days’ worth of antimony inventory. Germany has just 2 days’ worth of munitions supply. And geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, the Middle East, Afghanistan, and other places continue to aggravate the demand for antimony. So, antimony demand from defense is at record highs right now, and it’s only going to increase exponentially in the years to come. Washington's $1.8 Billion Antimony Push All these factors have together pushed antimony prices past $38,000 per ton – a 300% price increase in just the last 24 months.

As a result, Perpetua’s stock has shot up over 400% since March this year. But this rapid surge is just one example of the antimony sector's explosive potential. Now, Military Metals Corp (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF), an under-the-radar company with premium assets in friendly NATO territory is positioning itself for even bigger success... The company recently announced that it has purchased one of Europe’s largest antimony deposits in Slovakia. The flagship Trojarova property here features a historical Soviet-era resource of 61,998.4 tonnes of antimony which has a in-situ value of over $2 billion of antimony in the ground at today’s spot prices. Located just 30 minutes from Bratislava with excellent infrastructure, the company thinks they can fast-track this project with a resource estimate within 6 months. Then there’s the Tienesgrund property, also in Slovakia, which covers 13.38 km² and encompasses 40-50 historical mining tunnels dating back to 1840.

Historical ore extracts showed as high as 46% antimony content. Lastly, their Bear Creek property in Slovakia is a historical high-grade tin resource. The company got this project as a part of their Slovakia deal, but they’re thinking of divesting this to get money for their antimony projects. Key Factors Driving Military Metals Corp.’s Story At this critical point in the antimony market, Military Metals Corp. stands out for five key reasons... Significant Growth Potential: Even though the Military Metals Corp. stock has seen a substantial run in recent times, with the current market cap of just $23M vs real asset potential, there’s a lot more upside yet to be unlocked. Rising Market Awareness: Growing media coverage in the Financial Times, Forbes, etc., gives early investors a massive advantage in capitalizing on the coming antimony surge. Pure Antimony Play: Unlike gold or oil, there are no ETFs or futures contracts to trade antimony. Equity investments into junior mining companies, like Military Metals Corp., is the only real way to get exposure to antimony. Premium Asset Portfolio: The company has assets located at three prime locations in Slovakia and one location in Canada. Plus, the project qualifies under the European Critical Raw Materials Act, potentially helping to accelerate its development. To sum up, as global demand for antimony continues to rise and geopolitical tensions persist, securing stable supplies outside of China’s control remains a key challenge for Western nations. 8 bonus stocks to keep an eye on: Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

Title: Trump’s tariffs promise chaos — and Australia’s investments are in the firing line

End-of-year sale now on Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Australia's Future Fund has more than 40% of its assets invested in the US economy, which means the damage Trump inflicts hurts us too. Glenn Dyer and Bernard Keane Nov 27, 2024 21 Too bad if you’re a US company, like an automobile manufacturer, reliant on imports from Mexico. Donald Trump just promised to impose a 25% tax on your supply chain, along with everything else imported from Mexico. And Canada. The fact Trump himself negotiated and signed a free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement in 2020, is apparently irrelevant. And he’s announced a 10% “just for starters” tariff on Chinese imports. In response — even though Trump won’t be inaugurated for another two months — sharemarkets fell, but the US dollar rose (sending the Australian dollar falling further). The greenback had already risen against major currencies after Trump’s victory on November 5, and will likely appreciate every time the president-elect announces new tariffs — until markets price in the full effect of the tariff wall Trump has promised to erect around America. Each appreciation of the dollar will further erode the competitiveness of US exports and improve the competitiveness of imports against American products — undermining the very point of Trump’s taxes. Given how little grasp he appears to have about who bears the costs of tariffs, Trump will possibly react by simply increasing tariffs further. Along with his promise to deport every undocumented worker in the country, inflicting serious labour shortages on industries like construction and agriculture that depend on illegal immigrants for much of their workforce, and his threats to curtail the independence of the Federal Reserve, the tariffs will make for extremely uncertain times for US business — and investors in the US. Prominent among such investors is Australia’s Future Fund. Page 61 of the Fund’s 2023-24 annual report reveals that 43% of its $229.7 billion in assets are located in America via a heavy US weighting of listed and private equity, property, infrastructure and credit. That compares to just 27% of its assets invested in Australia, and is up from 39% in 2022-23. That’s a substantial change from before the pandemic: in 2019-20, Australia held the biggest share of the Future Fund’s assets — 39% against 31% for the US. The shift has also been lucrative for the Fund, which has benefitted from a stronger performance of Wall Street. US stocks have had a huge run since the start of 2023 with a 54% gain for the S&P 500, much of that coming from stocks like Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, Alphabet and Amazon. That index is up 26% this year to date against a 9.8% rise for the Australian ASX 200. But what about from here? It is hard to see how Trump’s tariffs, deportations and intervention in monetary policy will do anything else than damage US investor and consumer confidence, help slow the fall in inflationary pressures both in America and globally, reduce US exports and eventually undermine stock markets. Trump’s first presidency doesn’t appear to be a reliable guide: Wall Street rose by more than 40% during his first stint in the White House, but much of that was due to a huge pandemic surge from March 2020 that had little to do with Trump. What measures and hedging is the Fund putting in place to curb the risk posed by the next Trump presidency? An update on how it views the risks of its heavy investment in the US economy would be worthwhile — especially given the government is pressuring the fund to invest more in its favoured sectors here in Australia. It would be good to know if any shifts in weightings are because of risk management, rather than being responsive to Jim Chalmers’ interference. Have something to say about this article?

Title: NYSE files to list Bitwise’s Bitcoin and Ethereum mixed ETP

The ETP uses market cap weighting to give balanced and simplified exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum to investors. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. NYSE Arca filed a 19b-4 Form to list a Bitwise exchange-traded product (ETP) offering direct spot exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), weighted by their market capitalization. According to a Bitwise statement, the proposed Bitcoin-Ether ETP aims at simplifying portfolio allocation for investors seeking exposure to the crypto market’s most established assets. Its market-cap weighting ensures that the fund dynamically adjusts to reflect these assets’ evolving dominance. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan stated: “Bitcoin and ether aren’t competitors any more than gold and tech stocks are competitors. So when investors ask us which is better to add to their portfolio, often our answer is ‘both.’ This fund aims to make that recommendation easy and actionable, providing balanced exposure to the world’s two largest crypto assets. I think it’s going to be a huge hit with investors.” Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs have collectively amassed $4.2 billion in assets under management. If approved, this dual-asset ETP would be a first-of-its-kind product in the US market, allowing investors simultaneous exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies. However, other similar products are also waiting for approval. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently delayed the approval of Franklin Templeton’s Crypto Index ETF, which tracks BTC and ETH, although it is not market cap-weighted. Furthermore, Brazilian asset manager Hashdex filed to launch a similar product in June, as the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF would track BTC and ETH. According to CryptoSlate data, as of Nov. 26, BTC and ETH collectively had a market cap of over $2.1 trillion. Despite their dominance, investors usually perceive the two crypto use cases differently. Investors primarily regard Bitcoin as a digital store of value optimized for security and monetary use cases. Meanwhile, ETH powers the Ethereum blockchain, the largest decentralized ecosystem for applications, boasting nearly $110 billion in total value locked (TVL) as per DefiLlama data. Additionally, traditional finance giants like BlackRock, Visa, and Franklin Templeton chose the infrastructure to launch their products.

Title: Teach:able’s Founder Tackles A New Challenge: Democratizing Access To Tax-Efficient Retirement Accounts For The Self-Employed
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/elainepofeldt/2024/11/26/teachables-founder-tackles-a-new-challenge-democratizing-access-to-tax-efficient-retirement-accounts-for-the-self-employed/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T22:41:26Z
Full Content:
Ankur Nagpal, founder of the edu-tech startup Teach:able, has entered the wealth-tech world with ... [+] Carry. Ankur Nagpal started Teach:able, a platform for independent course creators, in 2013, with the dream of democratizing access to education. The first-generation immigrant from Oman, a 2010 graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, scaled that startup to $60 million in annual recurring revenue. He sold it to Hotmart, a platform that allows users to sell digital products around the world, in what he describes as a nine-figure exit in 2020. Now Nagpal aims to provide widespread access to something new: easy-to-use, tax-efficient retirement savings plans for the self-employed. In September 2022, he started Carry, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based startup that offers accounts such as a solo 401(k), a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA, brokerage accounts, and a no-fee robo advisor. Small businesses can currently use the accounts in conjunction with the payroll software Gusto or on their own. Carry raised $10 million in a Series A funding round led by Accomplice VC, based in Boston, in July 2024. Accomplice VC has backed startups such as AngelList, FreshBooks and Patreon. The company is picking up traction. Nagpal says it has about 2,000 paying customers and $60 million in assets under management and is generating over $1 million in annualized revenue. It has attracted most users through online courses, webinars and workshops, with no paid advertising yet. Nagpal projects that Carry will have 3,000 paying customers and approximately $100 million in assets under management by year-end. Carry is among a growing field of fin-tech and wealth-tech companies that promise to simplify investing through a better user experience. The wealth tech space is expected to grow to $18.6 billion by 2031, according to Allied Market Research. Some startups in the space have powerful partners. For instance, Douugh, a “smart banking” account provider based in Sydney Australia,offers investors access to a Bitcoin fund managed by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. As many entrepreneurs discover when their businesses start generating revenue, their taxes rise as their profits do. That can leave them with little left over to reinvest or save for retirement unless they find good advisors. Nagpal spotted a gap in the marketplace when the accountants and attorneys he hired for Teach:able saved him a significant amount on taxes. For every individual who had the means to invest in this expertise, he concluded, thousands of self-employed business owners did not—and were missing out. “Saving on taxes is important for everyone, but for a lot of people it's just too hard or too intimidating and they don't know where to start," Nagpal said. “I wanted to help business owners unlock tax savings.” One barrier many owners discover is the complexity of setting up their accounts in an industry where legal compliance is paramount. At Carry, he hopes to simplify that process. “A lot of people choose us for the user experience,” he says. “There’s better UI/UX.” Some owners find it too expensive to set their accounts up with traditional 401(k) providers. Setup costs may be as high as $2,000, often with annual administrative fees of $750 to $3,000. There may also be a fee for each participant. Carry, aiming to offer more attractive pricing, charges $299 a year for a basic plan and $499 a year for a plan that lets account holders invest in options including a custom plan, alternative assets like Bitcoin, a self-directed Roth IRA or self-directed Traditional IRA. Carry sets up the accounts but never has access to the funds in them. The entrepreneurs who set up the accounts are appointed the sole trustee and plan administrator. The firm works with Ocho Investment Advisors, an SEC-registered firm, and Drive Wealth LLC, an SEC-registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA/SIPC, via which securities and cash in the account are protected up to $500,000, of which $250,000 may be in cash. According to Carry, if the startup were to close, users’ 401(k)s would remain in existence, and all funds would remain under the control of the account holder. Account holders could keep their funds with Drive Wealth or transfer the assets to their bank account. Nagpal also runs Vibe Capital, a fund with nearly $100 million in assets under management, which has invested in more than 80 startups globally. Among them are Beacons, a platform for creators to sell their work; Vimcal, a calendar-scheduling app; and Writer, a secure enterprise platform that lets users create AI-first workflows. Accomplice VC, the lead investor in Carry, is an “anchor” limited partner behind Vibe. Matt Brezina, an early-stage technology investor and advisor at Ford Street Ventures in San Francisco, was one of the first investors in Teachable and is now an early investor in Carry. One reason is his belief in Nagpal’s entrepreneurial ability and growth-focused approach. "He's one of the greats, honestly. If I could find eight founders like him per year, my job would be really easy," says Brezina. In Brezina’s view, Carry solves a pressing need in the marketplace in addressing some of the pain of tax planning as a self-employed entrepreneur. “Charlie Munger said whoever you work with, you have one partner in every business deal with you, and that’s the IRS,” says Brezina. “Just thinking about your taxes and tax planning is an intelligent thing to do as a business owner.” Brezina set up his own solo 401(k) on the platform two years ago. He likes that it offers the ability to access asset classes not always available for 401(k)s with larger providers, such as Bitcoin. “Carry has been solving a lot of core problems for me,” he says. “They’ve made it really easy to know how much I can contribute to my Roth and regular 401(k) accounts for solo entrepreneurs. I’m now putting more money toward retirement than ever before because of their platform.” Whether other players start crowding into this specific niche remains to be seen. One barrier to entry is the heavy weight of compliance. As he grows the business, Nagpal is studying for his broker-dealer license. With fin-tech and wealth-tech platforms proliferating, Attorney Andrew Sherman, a partner in Brown Rudnick in Washington, D.C. who advises business owners, says it’s important for entrepreneurs to do their due diligence on any platforms they are considering, especially for a 401(k). "There are so many interesting solutions right now in wealth management and advice," he says. "If you're looking at it to manage your company's 401(k), I would add two or three layers of additional due diligence. You’re now acting as a fiduciary of your employees’ 401(k)s.” While many of the incumbents have the advantage of wide name recognition and decades of experience, Nagpal—tapping his experience as an early player in the online learning platform industry—hopes to offer something many bigger competitors can't: speed. When the Secure 2.0 Act of 2022 passed, Carry helped users get a $500 tax credit for each of three tax years by helping them to set up their accounts according to the law's requirements, he points out—while many competitors moved too slowly, he says. “Tax law is always changing and evolving,” he says. “We’ll be the first to react to it so we can pass on as many benefits as possible.”

Title: Former model had 12 alcoholic drinks before crash that caused death of woman, court told

Full Content:
A 46-year-old former model who pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing the death of a mother of two had consumed 12 alcoholic drinks, which included cocktails, prosecco, wine and gin, in the hours before the crash. Ms Sheila Dunne (50), who was described by her daughter as a “an amazing woman – worth her weight in gold”, died following a single-vehicle crash in Sarsfield Court in Glanmire, Cork, last February. Poignantly, her husband Ted had died of Covid in February 2021. The death of Ms Dunne left their two children without any living parent. The special needs assistant was just 1.5km from her home in Glanmire when the crash occurred. Jennifer Thomas of Oakfield View, Glanmire, Co Cork, appeared before Cork Circuit Criminal Court on Tuesday having pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing the death of Ms Dunne on February 11th last. Defence counsel Tom Creed, SC, told Judge Helen Boyle that “unfounded social media rumours” and inaccurate newspaper reports had circulated in the wake of the crash. He said that “malicious rumours” had spread in Cork that the body of Ms Dunne had been moved in the vehicle. Investigating garda Det Gda Mark Durcan confirmed there was no truth to any suggestions that Ms Thomas or any other person had moved the body of Ms Dunne following the crash. Det Gda Durcan said that the crash occurred at 7.30pm on February 11th last at Sarsfield Court in Glanmire in Cork. Ms Thomas had been socialising with Ms Dunne, her friend of more than 20 years, from lunchtime that day when they went for a meal at a restaurant in Douglas in the city. They went to a bar in Blackrock in Cork and then on to a bar in Glanmire before getting into Ms Thomas’s jeep. Det Gda Durcan said that in the minutes before the crash occurred Ms Thomas fell asleep behind the wheel twice while stopped at traffic lights. She did two U-turns in a matter of minutes and drove on the wrong side of the road at Hazelwood Road in Glanmire. She knocked down traffic cones as she drove towards Sallybrook and narrowly missed two pedestrians on the footpath. Det Gda Durcan said Ms Thomas took a left-hand bend at Sarsfield Court in Glanmire and failed to straighten up entering a grass verge. The Bluetooth system in the car automatically called the emergency services. Speed was not a factor in the case. Det Gda Durcan said Ms Thomas was wearing her seat belt when the crash occurred. However, Ms Dunne was not. He indicated that the impact of the crash led Ms Dunne, who was in the front-passenger seat, to fall on top of Ms Thomas. Det Gda Durcan said that roof had to be cut off the vehicle in order to extricate the women. He said when gardaí arrived at the scene Ms Thomas was asked who was driving. She said she was and then she “got erratic” and was unable to give a definitive answer. She then said that Ms Dunne was driving as she had “more control”. When she was shown CCTV at a later date by gardaí, Ms Thomas accepted that she was driving. She also said she had no recollection of the crash due to concussion. However, there was no medical evidence of concussion. Ms Dunne died in hospital two days after the crash. Lilley Dunne, a 23-year-old daughter of Sheila Dunne, said in her victim impact statement that she came to court with a “shattered heart” weighed down heavily by the loss of her “rock of a mother”. She said that she was speaking on behalf of herself and her younger brother. Lilley Dunne said that she and her brother head already suffered the “unbearable” loss of their father, Ted, from Covid. “Now to experience the agonising loss of Mom, feels like a cruel twist of fate that I cannot comprehend,” she said. “This experience is what I can only describe as hell. My beautiful mom was taken from us far too soon at the young age of 50. In a car crash caused by a reckless decision made by a selfish individual. This choice has altered our lives forever. “We spent two days at my mom’s bedside hoping for a miracle. Out of respect, I made the decision to allow Jennifer to come in to say goodbye to my mom. Knowing what I know now, my decision would have been different.” Ms Dunne said Ms Thomas’s “malicious lies” had trickled out to “vultures” in the media. “Compounding our grief, newspapers and social media outlets covered the story and reported that my mom was the driver of the car. Jennifer’s complete fabrication painted a picture of my mom, Sheila, that was far from the truth, sensationalising the tragedy and worsening our family suffering.” Sheila’s mother, Esther O’Brien, said she was “heartbroken” to have lost her daughter to a drunk driver. “This loss has not only shattered my life but has also left two precious grandchildren without their mother,” she said. The court heard that Ms Thomas had 10 previous convictions for road-traffic offences, larceny and misuse of drugs. Defence barrister Tom Creed, SC said witnesses who arrived at the scene of the crash described his client as being distraught at the possibility that Ms Dunne could have died. Mr Creed said that his client has suffered from long-term mental health difficulties and often wishes that she died during the crash. He added that Ms Thomas was hugely remorseful for her actions. Mr Creed said that his client accepted that getting behind the wheel drunk was an “outrageous” thing to do. Judge Boyle reserved her decision in the case. Ms Thomas was remanded in custody pending her sentencing on Thursday. She was warned that she was facing a custodial sentence. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: SolarZero insider’s shock: ‘No holiday pay, signs of trouble’ and expert’s doubts about firm’s model
URL: https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/solarzero-insiders-shock-no-holiday-pay-signs-of-trouble-and-experts-doubts-about-firms-model/6ACYOV4XANDVVNDEBNJ22KL2PI/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T20:38:30Z
Full Content:
Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. A SolarZero installation. One customer said it "feels like a liability on the roof now." An insider speaks out; owner BlackRock breaks its silence; the Government’s NZ Green Investment Finance details its exposure; the liquidator reassures customers on contracts; an expert reverse engineers SolarZero’s model and finds it wanting. More details have emerged in the wake of SolarZero’s shock liquidation, which affects 160 employees and has thrown some 15,000 customers into confusion. “All staff were called to a company-wide meeting,” the partner of a SolarZero employee told the Herald. “They were told their pay yesterday would be their last, and that there would be no holiday pay payout.” She said that while her partner and his co-workers were in shock, there had been signs of trouble over the past fortnight. “Staff were told to pause new business, so obviously the higher-ups knew something was wrong ... But even a month ago they were still hiring new people.” The ultimate pay situation would depend on whether the liquidators recovered any funds. Due to “unsustainable operating losses and liquidity constraints”, the business was unable to continue trading in its current form. She said the firm was “losing millions every year”. But it recently secured credit lines of more than $195 million to expand its no-money-up-front solar panel monthly subscription business from 15,000 customers to 100,000 “by the 2030s”. It was not immediately clear why the credit line could not be tapped. It’s understood a staff protest is planned for outside SolarZero’s Auckland office on Friday. The Herald asked liquidator Russell Moore of Grant Thornton to confirm the holiday pay situation, and if he could address how much was owed. “We will be dealing with such matters as is normal in liquidations. We will not be making further comments at this stage,” he replied. United States private equity giant BlackRock bought the 1970s-established business from its Kiwi founders for an undisclosed sum in 2022 and promised to invest up to $100m in expansion. One of the firm’s key lenders is the Government’s NZ Green Investment Finance (NZGIF). A spokeswoman told the Herald, “NZGIF has provided $145m for SolarZero to install solar panels and batteries on homes”. Asked how much of that facility had been drawn down, she said: “NZGIF is working with the senior lenders and the liquidator to assess the situation as it unfolds”. BlackRock responded to the Herald this afternoon but did not specifically address questions about how much money it had put into SolarZero. “A global fund under management by BlackRock Climate Infrastructure business has been the sole shareholder and the largest capital provider to SolarZero. The fund has provided significant additional funding to SolarZero since acquisition in December 2022 and has not taken any capital out during the period it held an interest in SolarZero,” a spokeswoman said in a statement. “BlackRock’s Climate Infrastructure business, on behalf of the fund, held extensive discussions with various stakeholders over a period of time to explore and work through several options to reach an outcome that would meet the needs of various parties, which regrettably could not be brought to fruition. “The team is deeply disappointed with this outcome and has worked with the SolarZero board to appoint a liquidator to ensure an orderly transition of the business in the interests of stakeholders, including SolarZero’s customers, employees, creditors, and others.” Customers posting on SolarZero’s Facebook page were concerned about their contracts being honoured. One wrote: “Our contracts still stand and we still get the second battery free after 10 years, correct?” Another asked: “Can we please have a heavily discounted liquidator sale buyback scheme? Feels like a liability on the roof now.” The Herald put those questions to the liquidators. “Verofi is now responsible for servicing customers. They have sent a message to existing customers that their service and contract remains the same,” Moore replied. SolarZero chief executive Matthew Ward posted to LinkedIn: “This has come as a big shock given the recent successful $195m financing with our banking partners, significantly improved commercial performance of the business over the past two years, and the assurances given to me and the leadership team that our shareholder would continue to invest in and support SolarZero to execute our business plan to continue to grow and build a commercially sustainable business. “From a personal perspective, team - please take care of yourselves. This is a shock to everyone. I am going to spend some time with my family who have definitely played second fiddle to work over the past five years or so, before making any decisions about next steps professionally. Kia kaha.” An email sent to SolarZero customers yesterday evening said: “Effective 4pm today November 26, SolarZero Limited (in liquidation) has ceased operations and will not be acquiring new customers. There will be no interruption in your energy service, and the terms of your agreement remain unchanged. “SolarZero has faced financial challenges and, after careful consideration the company’s directors have requested its senior lenders take enforcement action, including appointing Verofi as the standby servicer and placing the company into liquidation.” The liquidator’s first report is expected within five working days. SolarZero has at times been accused of pushy door-to-door sales tactics. Last month, Consumer said: “Our call centre has been running hot with inquiries about SolarZero ... There are certain things that homeowners need to take into consideration that muddy the waters.” The publication warned readers that if they signed with SolarZero, they’d be locked into one power retailer for their electricity needs beyond solar. Consumer told readers to “proceed with caution if you’re looking at taking up SolarZero on its offer”. In August, Consumer reported SolarZero customer Paul Doocey had been refunded $4000 after a longtime fight with SolarZero. Its system was removed from his Māngere home in 2017 after leaks, but he continued to be charged its monthly fees through to 2019. A veteran start-up adviser has voiced his doubts about SolarZero’s model. “SolarZero customers could buy solar panels and a battery set-up outright, which often runs to $20,000-plus or, as most do, pay nothing up-front,” CFO James Allard told the Herald last year. Solar Zero continues to own all the hardware and the customer pays it a set fee a month for “energy as a service”. Rates vary depending on the set-up, particularly the number of solar panels installed, but Allard says a family of four might pay around $177 per month. A 25-year contract term included one free battery replacement. If SolarZero panels don’t cover all of a customer’s needs, they buy electricity in the usual fashion from a power company (SolarZero currently partners with the Genesis-owned Ecotricity). Allard said Solar primarily took its solar panels from China’s JA Solar. Its batteries and inverters are primarily from Panasonic - which has also been a development partner for some of SolarZero’s technology. “A client reverse-engineered the SolarZero model and realised it was never going to work. They could never get a viable model working,” veteran start-up adviser Ralph Shale told the Herald. Shale, a former ANZ Investment Bank associate director of corporate finance before becoming Rocket Lab’s chief financial officer in the last decade, is now a principal at the CFO Centre, which offers services to high-growth companies. “SolarZero is basically a loan book - so I look at it like a financial instrument, like a Government bond with more risk. So if interest rates fall then the value of the asset [Solar Zero] goes up. If interest rates rise then the value falls. “My assumption is if the original investors in SolarZero got their money back it would have only been because rates fell significantly. “BlackRock bought in [in 2022] at the bottom of the interest rate cycle so the capital value since would have been going backwards - and they would have been losing money from operations. “My guess is they have written off the original $100m-plus investment and whatever capital they added in since then. “I understand the returns on residential solar as deployed by Solar Zero ... is around 4% to 5%, so with the cost of funding being now say 6% to 8% they are losing interest margin.”” He added: “Even with rates say down around 2% to 3% they were probably losing money after non-interest costs.” SolarZero chief executive Matt Ward told BusinessDesk: “It’s a real shock for me and the management team”. He said customers would still be looked after, “but our shareholder has decided to stop investing in the business”. BlackRock vehicle GRP III NZ Bidco was the sole shareholder at the time of the liquidation. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team.

If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. LAST UPDATE | 26 Nov A 46-YEAR-OLD former model who pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing the death of a mother of two had consumed 12 alcoholic drinks, which included cocktails, prosecco, wine and gin, in the hours before the crash. Ms Sheila Dunne (50) who was described by her daughter as a “an amazing woman — worth her weight in gold” died following a single vehicle crash in Sarsfield Court in Glanmire in Cork last February. Her husband Ted had died of Covid 19 in February of 2021. The death of Ms Dunne left their two children without any living parent. The special educational needs assistant was just 1.5km from her home in Glanmire when the crash that ended her life occurred. Jennifer Thomas of Oakfield View, Glanmire, Co Cork appeared before Cork Circuit Criminal Court today having pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing the death of Sheila Dunne on 11 February last. Defence counsel Tom Creed, SC, told Judge Helen Boyle that “unfounded social media rumours” and inaccurate newspaper reports had circulated in the wake of the crash. He said that “malicious rumours” had spread in Cork that the body of Sheila Dunne had been moved in the vehicle. Investigating garda Dt Garda Mark Durcan confirmed that there was no truth to any suggestions that Jennifer Thomas or any other person had moved the body of Sheila Dunne following the crash. Detective Garda Durcan said that the collision occurred at 7.30pm on 11 February last at Sarsfield Court in Glanmire in Cork. Ms Thomas had been socialising with Sheila, her friend of over twenty years, from lunchtime that day when they went for a meal at a restaurant in Douglas in the city. They went to a bar in Blackrock in Cork and then on to a bar in Glanmire prior to getting in to Jennifer’s jeep. Dt Garda Durcan said that in the minutes before the crash occurred, Jennifer fell asleep before the wheel twice whilst stopped at traffic lights. On one occasion, a passerby observed that Jennifer was asleep and knocked on the window of the jeep telling her to park up. Instead she did two U turns in a matter of minutes and drove on the wrong side of the road at Hazelwood Road in Glanmire. She knocked down traffic cones as she drove towards Sallybrook and narrowly missed knocking down two pedestrians on the footpath. Dt Garda Durcan said that Ms Thomas took a left-hand bend at Sarsfield Court in Glanmire and failed to straighten up entering a grass verge. The Bluetooth system in the car automatically called the emergency services. Speed was not a factor in the case. Dt Garda Durcan said that Ms Thomas was wearing her seat beat when the collision occurred. However Sheila Dunne was not. He indicated that the impact of the collision led Sheila, who was in the front passenger seat, to fall on top of Jennifer Thomas. Dt Garda Durcan said that roof had to be cut off the vehicle in order to extricate the women. He stated that when gardai arrived at the scene Jennifer Thomas was asked who was driving. She said that she was and then she “got erratic” and was unable to give a definitive answer. She then said that Sheila Dunne was driving as she had “more control.” When she was shown CCTV at a later date by gardai, Ms Thomas accepted that she was driving. She also said she had no recollection of the collision due to concussion. However, there was no medical evidence of concussion. Ms Dunne died in hospital two days after the crash. Lilley Dunne, the 23-year-old daughter of Sheila Dunne, said in her victim impact statement that she came to court with a “shattered heart” weighed down heavily by the loss of her “rock of a mother” Sheila. Lilley delivered her own victim impact statement and said she would forever miss her precious mother whom she described as a “pillar” in the community. She said that she was speaking on behalf of herself and her younger brother. Advertisement “I stand before you today as his voice and to outline the devastation we have both endured. I want to try and express as vividly as I can how this tragic event has destroyed my life, my brother’s world and our family unit as we know it.” Lilley said that she and her brother head already suffered the “unbearable” loss of their father Ted. “Now to experience the agonising loss of Mom, feels like a cruel twist of fate that I cannot comprehend. “On 9 February, 2021 my dad died unexpectedly from Covid. We had to watch him take his last few breaths as they removed his ventilator, and then on 13 February, 2024 I had to watch this all over again: watch my Mom’s heart slow to a halt. “This experience is what I can only describe as hell. My beautiful Mom was taken from us far too soon at the young age of fifty. In a car crash caused by a reckless decision made by a selfish individual. This choice has altered our lives forever. “We spent two days at my mom’s bedside hoping for a miracle. Out of respect, I made the decision to allow Jennifer to come in to say goodbye to my Mom. Knowing what I know now my decision would have been different.” Ms Dunne said that Jennifer’s absence of remorse had made the “grieving process so much more challenging.” “It is incredibly painful to know that someone would withhold the truth in such a devastating way and it makes it harder to heal from this loss.” Lilly said that her mother would miss all the special milestones of her life such as her wedding and watching her become a mother.” Ms Dunne insisted that Jennifer’s “malicious lies” trickled out to the “media vultures.” “Compounding our grief. Newspapers and social media outlets covered the story and reported that my Mom was the driver of the car. Jennifer’s complete fabrication painted a picture of my Mom, Sheila, that was far from the truth sensationalising the tragedy and worsening our family suffering.” Ms Dunne added that the life of her mother was “robbed” from her. “She has only started to live her life again after Dad’s passing. She will never get the opportunity to finish her bucket list, to see out the drams she had for her future or to watch TJ and I grow up.” Sheila’s mother Esther O’Brien said that she was “heartbroken” to have lost her daughter to a drunk driver. “This loss has not only shattered my life but has also left two precious grandchildren without their mother. My daughter was my biggest support. She was always there for me, providing love, care and companionship. We shared a deep bond, and she was my confidante, my source of strength. “Losing her has taken away my main support system at a time in my life when I need it most. This is something no mother could anticipate. I grapple with anger and sadness — not just for my daughter but also for the reckless choice that led to this loss. It is hard to trust and feel safe in the world when someone’s selfish decision has had such devastating consequences.” The court heard that Ms Thomas had ten previous convictions for road traffic offences, larceny and misuse of drugs. Defence barrister Tom Creed, SC, said that his client’s previous convictions for larceny and misuse of drugs occurred when she was a teenager. He emphasised that witnesses who arrived at the scene of the crash described his client as being distraught at the possibility that Sheila could have died. “(One eye witness) said she (Jennifer) was saying ‘please wake up please wake up’ to Miss Dunne. They tried to calm her. She (Jennifer) was saying ‘How can I live without her?” She was concerned for her friend. She (Jennifer) was hysterical. She was saying ‘look after Sheila.’ She appeared to be confused.” He said that unfortunately following this accident all sorts of “unfounded allegations” circulated in Cork. “One was that a phone call was made for someone to come to scene to move bodies. One was that she (Ms Thomas) was arrested for a charge of perverting course of justice which was never case. She voluntarily came to the station.” Mr Creed said that his client has suffered from long term mental health difficulties and often wishes that she died during the crash. He added that Ms Thomas was hugely remorseful for her actions. Mr Creed said that his client accepted that getting behind the wheel drunk was an “outrageous” thing to do. Judge Boyle offered her sincere condolences to the family of the deceased. She said that the family had painted a “wonderful picture” of Sheila. Judge Boyle reserved her decision in the case. Sentencing will take place on Thursday. Ms Thomas was remanded in custody pending her sentencing on Thursday. She was warned that she was facing a custodial sentence. Meanwhile, other charges faced by Ms Thomas, including one count of drink driving and three counts of dangerous driving, were added to the indictment and are to be taken into consideration when the sentence is handed down. The summary charges consist of allegations that Ms Thomas was under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle at Sarsfield Court, dangerous driving at Hazelwood Road, Sarsfield Court and Sallybrook, and falling to produce her driver’s licence.

Title: 4 gold investments to consider for 2025 (and 4 to avoid)

Watch CBS News We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms. By Angelica Leicht Edited By Matt Richardson November 26, 2024 / 3:22 PM EST / CBS News Gold has always held a unique position as a hedge against economic uncertainty, inflation and currency fluctuations — but the bull run that occurred over the past year may have been an even bigger selling point for investors. Starting the year at about $2,063 per ounce, gold's price moved upward quickly, hitting numerous new price records before peaking at over $2,736 per ounce in late October. That uptick in price helped to attract lots of new investors to the precious metals market. While the price of gold has dipped a bit since that point, many analysts still expect gold to hit the unprecedented milestone of $3,000 per ounce soon. So, if you've been planning to join the new and seasoned investors who have added gold to their portfolios recently, you may want to make your move quickly. Gold's price tends to fluctuate over the shorter term, so if you wait, you could miss out on the opportunity to buy gold at a lower price point. Before you start investing in this precious metal, though, it's important to recognize that not all gold investments are created equal. As we look ahead to 2025, certain gold assets stand out as potentially promising opportunities, while others carry risks that may outweigh their potential rewards. Ready to add gold to your portfolio? Get started here. Investing in these gold assets could pay off next year: Investing in physical gold in the form of gold bars and coins remains one of the safest ways to capitalize on potential price increases. These tangible assets provide direct ownership of gold and are highly liquid and universally recognized, making them an excellent choice for those seeking a straightforward hedge against economic instability. And, given all of the economic unknowns as we close in on 2025, making this type of gold investment could be a smart move to help protect your portfolio. Find out more about your gold investing options today. Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a convenient and cost-effective way to gain exposure to gold without the need for storage or insurance. These funds closely track the price of gold and are easily traded on stock exchanges, making them accessible to most types of investors. And with the expectation that gold prices will continue to rise over time, gold ETFs provide a flexible option for investors looking to benefit from upward momentum without committing to physical assets. Gold mining companies often experience amplified returns when gold prices rise, making these stocks an attractive option for growth-oriented investors. Stocks in major gold producers could see significant gains if gold's price climbs in 2025, so it makes sense to consider this type of gold investment in the new year. Investing in mining stocks also allows you to benefit from operational efficiencies and discoveries that can further boost profitability. Royalty and streaming companies could be another smart option for 2025. These companies provide financing to mining operations in exchange for a percentage of future production or revenue. This model insulates them from the operational risks associated with mining while still allowing them to profit from rising gold prices and their diversified portfolios and lower exposure to production costs make them a stable investment for those seeking exposure to the gold market. It could also make sense to avoid these gold investments right now: While standard gold ETFs are a solid investment, leveraged ETFs are a different story. These funds use borrowed money to amplify returns, which also increases potential losses. Leveraged ETFs are designed for short-term trading, not long-term holding, and can be highly volatile. With gold's trajectory uncertain despite optimistic predictions, these instruments are too risky for most investors right now. Junior mining companies, known for exploring and developing new gold deposits, can offer massive upside potential but are also incredibly risky. Many of these companies operate without generating consistent revenue, relying on capital markets for funding. If gold prices fail to rally as expected, these speculative investments could result in significant losses. Gold futures contracts allow investors to speculate on the future price of gold, but they require a high degree of expertise and risk tolerance. Small price movements can lead to substantial gains or losses, so unless you're an experienced trader, futures contracts are best avoided, especially in a potentially volatile gold market. While gold jewelry has intrinsic and aesthetic value, it is typically not a practical investment vehicle. High markups, craftsmanship costs and limited resale value make jewelry an inefficient way to capitalize on rising gold prices. Purer forms of gold like coins, bars or ETFs tend to offer better returns. Given the current economic landscape, 2025 could be a pivotal year for gold investors. Focusing on reliable investments like physical gold, gold ETFs and established mining companies can help you capitalize on it. At the same time, avoiding risky ventures such as speculative stocks, leveraged instruments and risky futures contracts will protect your portfolio from unnecessary volatility. By staying informed and strategic, you can position yourself to benefit from what could be an exciting year for the gold market.

Title: Shaping the Future of Fintech: How Knox Networks Aims to Rebuild Financial Infrastructure
URL: https://www.webpronews.com/shaping-the-future-of-fintech-how-knox-networks-aims-to-rebuild-financial-infrastructure/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T20:21:10Z
Full Content:
In an era when financial technology is evolving faster than ever, a few key players are at the forefront of this transformation. Among them is Knox Networks, a company that aims to reshape how financial institutions manage and move assets. Natalya Thakur, Co-Founder and CEO of Knox Networks, recently shared her insights into the future of fintech during a conversation on #NYSEFloorTalk with Judy Shaw. Thakur spoke with precision and passion about the potential of multi-asset ledgers, the challenges of legacy systems, and the opportunities that lie ahead for financial innovation. Listen to our discussion on the future of Fintech! “What we’re building at Knox is a multi-asset transaction ledger that provides secure movement of all regulated financial assets,” Thakur explained. “Today, when assets and money move, there are a lot of ledgers and rails behind the ecosystem, and it’s highly inefficient. There are just too many systems.” Knox is positioning itself as a solution to that inefficiency by providing a unified ledger service where financial institutions can manage their connections and transactions across both internal and external accounts. Bridging Legacy Systems with Modern Infrastructure Knox Networks aims to bridge the gap between traditional and digital assets, a task that is crucial as the financial world grows increasingly complex. According to Thakur, “Financial institutions today struggle with reconciliation, settlement risk, and fraud, all of which are exacerbated by the lack of real-time monitoring and interoperability across different asset classes.” This becomes even more complex when traditional assets are mixed with emerging digital currencies and digital wallets, which require a new kind of infrastructure to streamline transactions seamlessly. “We really want to be the bridge between these two ecosystems,” Thakur emphasized. The essence of what Knox aims to achieve is providing a consistent, real-time overview of cash and asset positions that helps financial institutions mitigate the challenges posed by outdated, siloed systems. A Unique Background in Finance and Technology Thakur’s journey into fintech innovation is as compelling as Knox’s ambitions. With over a decade of experience in traditional finance and digital assets, she has built her career at the intersection of the two domains, crafting her expertise in the future of money systems. “I’ve spent the last 10 years working at the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets,” Thakur noted. Her experience includes work on the capital markets desk at BlackRock and initial blockchain projects at Google. She has also been involved with several global initiatives aimed at standardizing and developing future monetary systems, including co-founding the Stanford Future of Digital Currency Initiative, in partnership with global banks and the United Nations. Thakur is also a member of the Bretton Woods Committee, which consists of financial executives and CEOs committed to preserving an innovative and resilient financial system. Key Milestones and Vision for 2025 Building a reliable, high-performance ledger infrastructure that meets the needs of regulated financial institutions is no easy feat. Knox spent its early years heavily focused on research and development, ensuring the technology it built could meet the high standards required by major financial institutions. “We spent our early years in R&D, trying to build the best multi-asset ledger and piloting with some of the largest global banking institutions,” Thakur explained. Those efforts have earned Knox global recognition, including awards from the G20, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and even the White House. This year, Knox shifted its focus from R&D to commercialization. According to Thakur, “We’re not just deploying our tech for banks; we’re thinking about how it can be applied across exchanges, asset managers, and other types of institutions.” Looking forward to 2025, Knox aims to capitalize on the network effects offered by its technology. “Our goal is to continue building on our partnerships and begin connecting different institutions that are using Knox, creating an interconnected financial ecosystem,” she added. Shaping the Future of FinTech: Partnerships and Applications Knox is particularly interested in partnering with financial institutions that span both traditional and digital assets. The target audience includes teams responsible for settlement and reconciliation, a crucial aspect of financial infrastructure that is often fraught with inefficiencies. Thakur pointed to Stripe’s recent acquisition of Bridge as a signal of where the industry is heading. “Stablecoins are becoming a bigger part of financial institutions’ operations, and Knox can help these institutions plug into their stablecoin ecosystem of choice, while offering a real-time view of all cash, asset, and stablecoin positions,” she said. The broader trend, Thakur explained, is towards a “rebundling” of financial services. In an industry where fragmentation has often been the rule, Knox is working to unify different types of financial operations under a single, powerful system. “A lot of financial institutions are saying they want one system to do more things, instead of having 15 different systems to manage 15 different asset classes,” she said. Advice for FinTech Entrepreneurs When asked for her advice to emerging founders in fintech, Thakur offered a mix of practicality and wisdom. “First off, you need to be obsessed with what you’re building and truly respect the people you’re working with,” she said. “Ideally, you’re working with people who are much smarter than you. It helps maintain level-headedness through the ups and downs of entrepreneurship.” Thakur also emphasized the importance of being intentional about customer acquisition. “Who you sell to in the first three months of your business is very different from who you sell to in year five or ten. That first customer is your most important, and they set the tone for everything that follows,” she said. Lastly, Thakur underscored the need for resilience in the face of the unpredictable. “Outcomes in your business are influenced by so many factors beyond your control. If something doesn’t go as planned, just pick up and move on quickly.” A Bold Vision for the Future The work that Knox Networks is undertaking is ambitious, but it’s precisely what the financial sector needs as it grapples with digital transformation and a future increasingly defined by digital assets. Thakur’s vision—one in which traditional financial systems are brought into harmony with the emerging digital asset landscape—is already taking shape, and 2025 promises to be a pivotal year. With plans to leverage network effects and connect financial institutions on an interoperable platform, Knox Networks could very well be the bridge that the fragmented world of finance desperately needs. As the industry moves towards fewer, more integrated systems, Thakur’s company is positioned to play a leading role in ensuring that financial technology not only advances but does so in a way that is secure, transparent, and efficient. “We’re building the infrastructure for the future of finance,” Thakur concluded. “One that’s truly interoperable and capable of adapting to whatever comes next.”

Pantera Capital Management’s Bitcoin Fund just hit a milestone: a 1,000-fold gain in the value of its crypto holdings since launch. Started in 2013 as one of the first investment products exposing customers to crypto, the fund has returned 131,165% after expenses and fees. As noted by founder Dan Morehead on X, the fund saw a huge surge following Donald Trump's election as U.S. president this month. Pantera Bitcoin Fund recently achieved an insane milestone – 1,000x.The post-election surge has taken the fund a further 30% higher. The Fund’s lifetime return is now 131,165%­ – net of fees and expenses.My current outlook on #Bitcoin: https://t.co/0dS8GERNDB pic.twitter.com/plld0BMbef To get started in bitcoin investing, the Bitcoin Fund bought 2% of the world’s bitcoin (BTC) supply when the cryptocurrency's price was around $74. BTC has skyrocketed over 120% in this past year alone, pushing it to a new all-time high just below $100,000. “I think we should buy aggressively now,” Morehead wrote in a letter dated July 5, 2013, that he shared publicly Tuesday. “The price is going WAY UP. It's going to squeeze up like a watermelon seed.” Years later, bitcoin is “still squeezing up like a watermelon seed,” Morehead wrote in a memo on Tuesday. He predicts that the cryptocurrency could reach $740,000 by April 2028, which would translate into a $15 trillion market capitalization, due to the fact that 95% of financial wealth has not yet addressed blockchain, he said. Morehead gave credit to institutional managers like BlackRock and Fidelty, both which launched spot bitcoin and ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds earlier this year, for easing access to the industry and allowing exposure to their tens of millions of clients. He also said that blockchain’s 15-year regulatory headwinds will now finally turn into tailwinds with the first pro-blockchain U.S. president taking office in January.

If you want to be happy or happier, the best way to do it is to purchase accumulate and acquire bitcoin, like taking your economic happiness and energy, and putting it into an infallible bitcoin. So assuming that you’re living in Mexico City, Thailand, Vietnam Cambodia Laos, off the grid, and you love being off the grid, not being tied down by anything… Bitcoin is the ultimate freedom energy economic power property you can own. For example, I think one critical mistake a lot of millennials make is they want to buy some sort of like weird off-roading Mercedes sprinter van, and they essentially like a homeless people in RV parks? So for myself, I’ve always had a passion for nontraditional idea paths etc. To be contrarian means to just go against the herd. So for example, even though I’m a huge fan of Tesla and Elon Musk, am I the only successful millennial person individual, super rich who would actually prefer having a Toyota Prius or maybe now, the Lexus TX car? I think there’s a lot of press about you being able to camp and live in a cyber truck, and I think it’s a great idea, but, I find it actually much more practical to get like maybe a Lexus TX Plugin hybrid car, the ultimate luxury SUV minivan, and just sleep and live in the trunk of that? The side is once again, the plug-in hybrid concept is still the most best double leverage thing you can get; the side of gasoline, which power is like 90% of humanity, and also, electricity, the Hybrid engine, as well as the plug-in capability. Something that people don’t really talk about is that the upside of having a hybrid car is that when you idle, most often times it is silent. This is phenomenally fantastic if you’re taking a nap in the car with your kid! No solo gasoline car is worth it; either hybrid, plug-in hybrid or nothing. ￼ Once again, even today… We are still stuck in this slave like mentality of vehicle ownership. I suppose the good thing about having an old Prius is that it never feels like a liability. If somebody steals it, hit it I could care less. Also pro tip, if you have peeling paint or something on your car, just order some 3M matte black vinyl vehicle wrap online, cut it yourself and just stick it on like a sticker! Looks very cool. Another funny trend, everyone in LA wants to murder at their cars in all black, but, this is a positively bad idea because Los Angeles is essentially a desert with lots of dirt particles in the air, the ideal car color is either white or some sort of desert tan color; any color which does not show dirt. And also a lot of these fools don’t understand is that if you have a black vehicle, you’re going to get cooked alive in the summertime! The funny thing is actually… When I was a kid growing up, nobody wanted to own a black car. A sports car was universally red; everyone wanted the red Integra type R, with the gloss white rims. I could care less about your four bitcoin Ferrari, or your two bitcoin Lamborghini. Or your one bitcoin cyber truck. What is super interesting and fasting about bitcoin is that it is almost like wealth on wheels. And only that but it is like the ultimate type of wealth and property you could actually own. Why? It is like perpetually in your mind in your head and your soul; and it is not physical, yet it is real and exists. A lot of people don’t understand what this point is, they think that it is fake money. But no, bitcoin is digital cyber capital, which is 1 trillion times more profound as an idea. Why? If you could teleport a skyscraper into cyberspace, make it immortal, immutable, indefinitely divisible, with no property tax, no mayor trying to put regulations on you, no death in decay, no annoying tenants etc.… You essentially have perfected digital and cyber capital And property. ￼ Traditionally, in the past, you only purchased real estate not for the utility purposes, but rather, as a long-term store value and or maybe income generation? The difficult thing is at best, you have to skillfully manage your real estate and property, get good tenants, collect the rent, but still you might have to deal with Insurance, things breaking, changing zoning laws in your local city or area, etc. I think this is a hard thing for a lot of people to understand is that you cannot tax bitcoin, only if you sell it. But if you never intend to sell it, you will never actually incur a capital gains tax, and even greater… The amazing thing about bitcoin is that assuming that it is digital property, you don’t have to pay Property taxes for simply holding it and owning it. Let us say you buy a $2 million home in all cash, but still… Even with a nominal 1 to 1.25 or 1.5% property tax, you’re going to be paying like 2000, $2500, maybe even $3000 a month in property taxes, simply for owning the thing. And you’re going to have to pay that forever. ￼ This is kind of a scary thing… And it seems a little bit weird and unethical; if you own a piece of land, why do you need to pay taxes simply for the right of owning it? Like for example if I own a gold bar, in this gold bar is my property, I don’t have to pay 1% ￼tax on it, simply for owning it, forever? Even in some ways, maybe we consider inflation like an indirect tax on you. For example if you have like $1 million of cash just sitting in a checking account, the reason why this is bad is because it is draining economic energy like 15% a year. For example you’re $1 million worth of cash is going to degrade to like 750,000 the first year, $500,000 the next year, $250,000 the next year, down to $125k the next year etc. kind of a really bad situation. Volatility is energy power and vitality and vigor. Volatility is power! So for example, a nuclear reactor is very very volatile, but it is perhaps maybe one of the best blessings for humankind, because if managed in handled properly, it’s like free electricity and power for everyone forever. Bitcoin is like nuclear economic energy and power. Maybe people are afraid of bitcoin like they are afraid of nuclear power plants. Certainly we do not want a Fukushima,,, but still, certainly in the early adoption years of electricity, I’m sure that there are some people who accidentally electrified themselves to death. ￼ Also, I am also very certain in the early days of fire, there must have been some caveman who were burned to death. Or even the early water wheel, I’m sure there are some people who accidentally got crushed to death by it. But we do not ban these things simply because there were a handful of people who died from it. If you think about Satoshi like being Prometheus, who brought fire to the masses, isn’t this like the greatest blessing of all time? It seems that Michael Saylor and the like talk about Satoshi with some sort of extremely deep reverence. Even I was shocked. Also what becomes very interesting about bitcoin in general is that it definitely is starting to become like religious at this perspective. Like even beyond a cult. Religion. The immaculate conception of bitcoin, Satoshi, giving this gift to humanity, and essentially disappearing forever. Anybody who claims to be Satoshi, ignore them, they certainly are not. Why? Because 1, million bitcoins is essentially like worth what, $200 billion or something, essentially in the next upcoming months and years you’re going to see Satoshi becoming even richer than Elon Musk. And I’m very certain that within the next 5 to 10 years, you’re going to see Michael Saylor maybe being at least 2 to 3 times richer Than even Elon Musk. ￼ Anyways if you have that much energy power in wealth and bitcoins, you are not going to want to have anybody know who you are because realistically your life will probably be in peril. Very simple thing… He has literally almost like tripled my net worth in the matter of three months? There is no other human being on the planet who has ever directly or indirectly did this for me? And the reason why this is such a big deal is once again, now, as a consequence, the cost of living in LA becomes like a joke, really kind of not a big deal, I feel comfortable having 2, 3, 4 or even five kids. ￼￼ Another mistake that people make is that the point of becoming super rich is not to suddenly go out and buy a bunch of silly things. The purpose of the point is instead, to rather, live a more carefree life, less stress less anxieties less annoyance. Dropping $500 on beef ribs at Costco is just like a drop in the bucket. At this point the only money I spend on myself is my weightlifting equipment, my beef ribs, and maybe some new Vibram five fingers when my shoes fall apart. But besides this, I have like no use for money. And once again, the goal is to build in stack capital, we all live in capitalism, not “moneyism”. ERIC KIM CAPITAL a good ring to it. or ERIC KIM KAPITAL Ironically enough it is once again not really about consumerism, if you were a real capitalist, your joy is more in senior capital stack, not seeing it becoming depleted because you bought some sort of loser Ferrari or Porsche. I’m still shocked; 95% of water in America, we are simply being baited along by having some sort of allure of some sort of luxury vehicle but isn’t ideal to be like a digital nomad, traveling to Japan and Kyoto, visiting the Hot Springs, or living this luxurious Expat life in Cambodia Vietnam or Thailand? For example, my friend Todd Hata did it well, he sold his old house in the mountains in LA, and is essentially like on the road 90% of the year, jumping between Mexico City, Thailand, Greece etc. His passion has always been travel, and food and experiences, very wise. Even if you’re the average American, most people cannot afford to purchase physical property. And once again, if you do the math, after homeowners insurance, Tax, fire taxes, ￼ stuff breaking, having to change the roof, getting a new washer and dryer or dishwasher, upgrading your kitchen, you’re going to bleed yourself dry. And not only that but I think being a homeowner becomes a new consumerist things; spent too much time thinking about how to break down walls to extend your home, build an ADU, update the kitchen whatever. Or expanding your garden, changing the flooring etc. But don’t you realize that the best thing to do is just be in nature? Or just drive to the Huntington Gardens on the weekend, or just travel to Japan instead? In fact when you go on a flight, and you see all these little tiny homes From Birds Eye view, you realize how ridiculous the desire of homeownership is. I think real estate will be the next sector that bitcoin gobbles up. The average GenZ person doesn’t care for buying a house, they want to just play pickle ball, go hiking and camping, go on road trips, buy the newest iPhone etc. Pursue their hobbies and passions. Millennials, we are a funny basket case. We used to be like GenZ, wanting to travel to planet, become a digital nomad, etc.… But somewhere along the line, maybe because of Covid, we tried to settle down and buy single-family homes instead? Or condos? I’m starting to feel like this is the early the Internet, AOL, AOL 3.0, you got mail, dial up 56K modems etc. I also like bitcoin because it is just easier to mentally and mathematically remember things. Easier to remember how many bitcoins you have on the top of your head, rather than trying to tabulate all the ones and zeros of all your fake fiat based assets? Rather than thinking about your net worth, easier to just remember your net bitcoins; ￼ Whenever I find out that somebody else is into bitcoin, I have zero issues asking them how many bitcoins they own. Why? Because it is still a relatively new field, it is awkward to ask people how much US dollars they have in their savings account, or checking account, Easier to just ask the bitcoin question. And for me, even owning a single bitcoin is like for me, owning like a square block of digital Manhattan or Kyoto. You know these rich families that own huge plots of land in desirable locations? Yeah, that’s like bitcoin. A single-family home in Beverly Hills is what like at least 5 million, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million? 100,000,000? My personal projection is if you tag the price of a bitcoin to desirable real estate in the Brentwood Hills or something, just think about what the land is worth for the Getty museum. Or like owning a piece of land or property next to the PCH in Malibu. But actually if you think about it, the value of a single bitcoin is worth 1 trillion times more than even the best property in Malibu. Why? The dangers of owning physical property, landslides, Robberies, general maintenance. The fear that your housekeeper is stealing your stuff. For example, how comfortable are you leaving your $200,000 Rolex just sitting around? Probably not very comfortable. Bitcoin is the new family jewels. Take all of your scarce desirable assets like your Rolexes, your Leica, your Porsche and just buy bitcoin instead. Because once again , to have any sort of physical property in the physical realm is a liability not an asset. I’m starting to feel more bullish, increasing my target price of bitcoin to at least $55 million a coin. Probably higher. So if that’s the case, if you took a $10,000 Rolex, and sold it, assuming that bitcoin is around $95,000 of bitcoin right now, even lower at 89,000 of bitcoin or even $85,000 of bitcoin, whatever it may… Is massive upside. 611x The $6 million Rolex? Once again, so many of these things are just liabilities. I hate the fear of having to remember where I left it, and whether it is safe, whether it was stolen or not or whatever. Rather than putting your scarce desirable things into a physical vault, isn’t it far safer for it to be in a cyber Vault, on the Blockchain? What is the Blockchain,? It is like the cloud on steroids, with 1000 X more security power and cryptographic security. It took a long time for people to trust putting files on the cloud, or photos on the cloud, but now it seems like the obvious decision. I think the reason why I like Coinbase is that rather than having to memorize some keys in my head and have a hardware physical wallet, and knowing myself I am quite forgetful, you don’t want to lose like $1 billion worth of bitcoin because you forgot your password. I think this is also where this is a huge opportunity for Apple; if we have all of our bitcoin passwords and keys linked to our iCloud account, certainly we will never stop purchasing Apple devices. Even bigger, if Apple makes their own bitcoin ecosystem to custody your bitcoin in your Apple ID wallet, This could actually disrupt the whole Coinbase market. Let us consider that most of us have Apple Pay already enabled, how easy would it be to just buy bitcoin directly from your iPhone using Apple Pay? And it could be simple, you could just buy 10 bucks here, 20 bucks here, 50 bucks here, 100 bucks here etc. I don’t have an Apple credit card or bank account, but this seems like a good idea. I hate the weekends because the markets are closed. I would prefer a world in which my micro strategy stock could trade 24 7, 365, every day all day every day, on binance fidelity or something else. Apparently in 1933, the way that the traditional stock market was structured was actually to legitimately create a cartel. This is like the almost the exact opposite of American values of freedom, self sovereignty and freedom. Michael Saylor had a very interesting idea; why can you not own Apple stock directly on your Apple iPhone? There is nothing unethical about it. And technologically, we live in the year 2024 of course could be physically possible. Even the stock market is mostly driven by robots, you no longer have guys on the slips of paper. It ain’t like the Wolf of Wall Street. It’s like the wolf of cyber Wall Street.￼ Even here in Culver City, kind of like peak LA, there are so many businesses which are getting shut down like even me and Seneca’s beloved shake shack, and even more shockingly today, chipotle. If these trusted namebrand businesses are struggling in going out of business because we cannot afford to pay the rent or whatever… Isn’t this pretty bad? And also, physical entropy. Once again, if you want a physical house, shit will always break and you’re going to have to be liable for it. If you have an amazing landlord who always fixes everything super fast, even put in brand new appliances for you, leverage and milk that forever. Even we told our landlord that our washer washing machine had a little bit of rust in it, immediately sent in his team and installed a totally brand new Samsung washer and dryer , which might have caused like $5000 $6000? Even another thing that was interesting, there were some palm trees which were growing on top of the roof, and he just sent in a team to get it all cut down and fixed up? Even we had some issues with our electricity and water and water heater, once again he snapped his fingers and got it all resolved in a day or two, while me and Seneca having a fun adventure at the park. For myself, my core competency is within writing thinking blogging vlogging etc. ￼ from an economic perspective it kind of makes no sense for me to waste my time having to manage a home and fix things. I would rather manage thoughts ideas, big visions?

Title: Pantera Capital Sees 131,165% Performance on BTC As CEO Dan Morehead Says Bitcoin Has Reached ‘Escape Velocity’

Digital assets-focused investment firm Pantera Capital is celebrating a massive four-figure return on its Bitcoin (BTC) fund, which dates back to 2013. In its latest Blockchain Letter, Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead says that the Pantera Bitcoin Fund “recently achieved an insane milestone – 1,000x.” “The post-election surge has taken the fund a further 30% higher. The Fund’s lifetime return is now 131,165%­ – net of fees and expenses.” Morehead also believes Bitcoin is on track to soar to an astronomical value through greater adoption, in part due to the election of pro-crypto Donald Trump as US president. He notes that only about 5% of the world’s wealth currently has taken a position in Bitcoin. “The catalyst for the change – from 5% [of financial wealth] in 2024 to a much higher number – just happened: regulatory clarity in the United States. Massive institutional managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others are now offering incredibly cheap, efficient access to anyone with a brokerage account. This new ease of access will finally allow tens of millions of investors and individuals to get exposure to this important new asset class. We believe the broader industry will benefit greatly from the first pro-blockchain US president in office. In our view, blockchain’s success is in the best interest of the nation and we believe everyone in Congress will eventually adopt a neutral or pro-blockchain stance – it’s beginning to happen. Blockchain’s 15-year regulatory headwinds are now turning into tailwinds.” Morehead says the greater adoption may send Bitcoin soaring more than 687% from its current value. “That’s still exactly how I feel. We’re still early. 95% of financial wealth has not addressed blockchain. They are just beginning this massive transformation now. When they do, Bitcoin might be at something like $740,000 per BTC.” In a new interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Morehead says that due to the current level of adoption, he is no longer telling people that Bitcoin has a chance of going to $0. “I used to tell people it could definitely go to zero to try and be conservative. I don’t think it’s possible now. Fifty million people in the US own it, 300 million people globally. BlackRock and Fidelity are selling it. It really has reached escape velocity.” Bitcoin is trading for $93,931 at time of writing, up more than 152% on the year.

Focus on Strengths • Free your time from managing physical assets; focus on big ideas and your unique talents. Bitcoin is the future—stack it, live free, and build your life around what truly matters. *** Do you want to be happy or happier, the best way to do it is to purchase accumulate and acquire bitcoin, like taking your economic happiness and energy, and putting it into an infallible bitcoin. So assuming that you’re living in Mexico City, Thailand, Vietnam Cambodia Laos, off the grid, and you love being off the grid, not being tied down by anything… Bitcoin is the ultimate freedom energy economic power property you can own. For example, I think one critical mistake a lot of millennials make is they want to buy some sort of like weird off-roading Mercedes sprinter van, and they essentially like a homeless people in RV parks? So for myself, I’ve always had a passion for nontraditional idea paths etc. To be contrarian means to just go against the herd. So for example, even though I’m a huge fan of Tesla and Elon Musk, am I the only successful millennial person individual, super rich who would actually prefer having a Toyota Prius or maybe now, the Lexus TX car? I think there’s a lot of press about you being able to camp and live in a cyber truck, and I think it’s a great idea, but, I find it actually much more practical to get like maybe a Lexus TX Plugin hybrid car, the ultimate luxury SUV minivan, and just sleep and live in the trunk of that? The side is once again, the plug-in hybrid concept is still the most best double leverage thing you can get; the side of gasoline, which power is like 90% of humanity, and also, electricity, the Hybrid engine, as well as the plug-in capability. Something that people don’t really talk about is that the upside of having a hybrid car is that when you idle, most often times it is silent. This is phenomenally fantastic if you’re taking a nap in the car with your kid! No solo gasoline car is worth it; either hybrid, plug-in hybrid or nothing. ￼ Once again, even today… We are still stuck in this slave like mentality of vehicle ownership. I suppose the good thing about having an old Prius is that it never feels like a liability. If somebody steals it, hit it I could care less. Also pro tip, if you have peeling paint or something on your car, just order some 3M matte black vinyl vehicle wrap online, cut it yourself and just stick it on like a sticker! Looks very cool. Another funny trend, everyone in LA wants to murder at their cars in all black, but, this is a positively bad idea because Los Angeles is essentially a desert with lots of dirt particles in the air, the ideal car color is either white or some sort of desert tan color; any color which does not show dirt. And also a lot of these fools don’t understand is that if you have a black vehicle, you’re going to get cooked alive in the summertime!

I could care less about your four bitcoin Ferrari, or your two bitcoin Lamborghini. Or your one bitcoin cyber truck. What is super interesting and fasting about bitcoin is that it is almost like wealth on wheels. And only that but it is like the ultimate type of wealth and property you could actually own. Why? It is like perpetually in your mind in your head and your soul; and it is not physical, yet it is real and exists. A lot of people don’t understand what this point is, they think that it is fake money. But no, bitcoin is digital cyber capital, which is 1 trillion times more profound as an idea. Why? If you could teleport a skyscraper into cyberspace, make it immortal, immutable, indefinitely divisible, with no property tax, no mayor trying to put regulations on you, no death in decay, no annoying tenants etc.… You essentially have perfected digital and cyber capital And property. ￼ Traditionally, in the past, you only purchased real estate not for the utility purposes, but rather, as a long-term store value and or maybe income generation? The difficult thing is at best, you have to skillfully manage your real estate and property, get good tenants, collect the rent, but still you might have to deal with Insurance, things breaking, changing zoning laws in your local city or area, etc. I think this is a hard thing for a lot of people to understand is that you cannot tax bitcoin, only if you sell it. But if you never intend to sell it, you will never actually incur a capital gains tax, and even greater… The amazing thing about bitcoin is that assuming that it is digital property, you don’t have to pay Property taxes for simply holding it and owning it. Let us say you buy a $2 million home in all cash, but still… Even with a nominal 1 to 1.25 or 1.5% property tax, you’re going to be paying like 2000, $2500, maybe even $3000 a month in property taxes, simply for owning the thing.

Very simple thing… He has literally almost like tripled my net worth in the matter of three months? There is no other human being on the planet who has ever directly or indirectly did this for me?

Take all of your scarce desirable assets like your Rolexes, your Leica, your Porsche and just buy bitcoin instead. Because once again , to have any sort of physical property in the physical realm is a liability not an asset. I’m starting to feel more bullish, increasing my target price of bitcoin to at least $55 million a coin. Probably higher. So if that’s the case, if you took a $10,000 Rolex, and sold it, assuming that bitcoin is around $95,000 of bitcoin right now, even lower at 89,000 of bitcoin or even $85,000 of bitcoin, whatever it may… Is massive upside. 611x The $6 million Rolex? Once again, so many of these things are just liabilities. I hate the fear of having to remember where I left it, and whether it is safe, whether it was stolen or not or whatever. Rather than putting your scarce desirable things into a physical vault, isn’t it far safer for it to be in a cyber Vault, on the Blockchain? What is the Blockchain,? It is like the cloud on steroids, with 1000 X more security power and cryptographic security. It took a long time for people to trust putting files on the cloud, or photos on the cloud, but now it seems like the obvious decision. I think the reason why I like Coinbase is that rather than having to memorize some keys in my head and have a hardware physical wallet, and knowing myself I am quite forgetful, you don’t want to lose like $1 billion worth of bitcoin because you forgot your password. I think this is also where this is a huge opportunity for Apple; if we have all of our bitcoin passwords and keys linked to our iCloud account, certainly we will never stop purchasing Apple devices. Even bigger, if Apple makes their own bitcoin ecosystem to custody your bitcoin in your Apple ID wallet, This could actually disrupt the whole Coinbase market. Let us consider that most of us have Apple Pay already enabled, how easy would it be to just buy bitcoin directly from your iPhone using Apple Pay? And it could be simple, you could just buy 10 bucks here, 20 bucks here, 50 bucks here, 100 bucks here etc. I don’t have an Apple credit card or bank account, but this seems like a good idea. I hate the weekends because the markets are closed. I would prefer a world in which my micro strategy stock could trade 24 7, 365, every day all day every day, on binance fidelity or something else. Apparently in 1933, the way that the traditional stock market was structured was actually to legitimately create a cartel. This is like the almost the exact opposite of American values of freedom, self sovereignty and freedom. Michael Saylor had a very interesting idea; why can you not own Apple stock directly on your Apple iPhone? There is nothing unethical about it. And technologically, we live in the year 2024 of course could be physically possible. Even the stock market is mostly driven by robots, you no longer have guys on the slips of paper. It ain’t like the Wolf of Wall Street. It’s like the wolf of cyber Wall Street.￼ Even here in Culver City, kind of like peak LA, there are so many businesses which are getting shut down like even me and Seneca’s beloved shake shack, and even more shockingly today, chipotle. If these trusted namebrand businesses are struggling in going out of business because we cannot afford to pay the rent or whatever… Isn’t this pretty bad? And also, physical entropy. Once again, if you want a physical house, shit will always break and you’re going to have to be liable for it. If you have an amazing landlord who always fixes everything super fast, even put in brand new appliances for you, leverage and milk that forever. Even we told our landlord that our washer washing machine had a little bit of rust in it, immediately sent in his team and installed a totally brand new Samsung washer and dryer , which might have caused like $5000 $6000? Even another thing that was interesting, there were some palm trees which were growing on top of the roof, and he just sent in a team to get it all cut down and fixed up? Even we had some issues with our electricity and water and water heater, once again he snapped his fingers and got it all resolved in a day or two, while me and Seneca having a fun adventure at the park. For myself, my core competency is within writing thinking blogging vlogging etc. ￼ from an economic perspective it kind of makes no sense for me to waste my time having to manage a home and fix things. I would rather manage thoughts ideas, big visions? When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

File photo. SolarZero directors say the company explored a range of options for a restructure, but were unable to find a viable solution. Photo: lighthunter/123RF Solar power company SolarZero has been put into liquidation, leaving some customers worried about the contracts they have signed with the company. The company - which offers customers solar power systems with no upfront cost but an ongoing, multi-decade lease - said the directors had requested its shareholder appoint a liquidator. It said directors had requested its senior lenders take enforcement action, and appoint another provider Verofi, to ensure power service for customers was not interrupted. "The directors have advised company employees that due to unsustainable operating losses, and liquidity constraints, the business is unable to continue trading in its current form. "As a result, the company has ceased operations from 4pm [Tuesday]. Russell Moore and Stephen Keen of Grant Thornton have been appointed as the liquidators of SolarZero." SolarZero is owned by GRP III Regional Holdings Ltd, part of the BlackRock Group. It was founded in the 1970s and has 160 employees throughout the country and offices in Auckland, Christchurch and Wanaka. SolarZero directors said the company had explored a range of options for a restructure. "Regretfully, SolarZero and its key stakeholders were unable to find a viable solution to sustain the business. "This is a tough day for SolarZero teams, who have worked hard to build a more sustainable New Zealand. Today's decision is not a reflection on their work or commitment." Customers posting on SolarZero's Facebook page were concerned about their contracts being honoured. One wrote: "Our contracts still stand and we still get the second battery free after 10 years, correct?" Another asked: "Can we please have a heavily discounted liquidator sale buy back scheme.

Pantera Capital's Bitcoin fund showcases an 88% compound annual growth rate over 11 years and a transformative shift in financial adoption. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Pantera Capital reported an extraordinary milestone for its Bitcoin Fund, which has grown more than 1,000x since its launch in 2013, according to a report shared with CryptoSlate. The fund’s performance reflects Bitcoin’s (BTC) surging value, now exceeding $90,000 per coin, with a projected long-term trajectory suggesting continued upward momentum. The Pantera Bitcoin Fund launched when Bitcoin was priced at $74, marking the lowest point in over a decade. As of Nov. 24, the fund’s value reached $97,392 per Bitcoin, representing a 1,313x return for early investors. Pantera CEO Dan Morehead emphasized the fund’s remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 88% over its 11-year history, illustrating Bitcoin’s unique position as a high-growth asset class. Pantera’s analysis compared Bitcoin’s market capitalization to some of the world’s largest corporations. With a $2 trillion valuation, Bitcoin ranks as the fifth-largest asset globally, surpassing tech giant Meta and automotive leader Tesla. Bitcoin now trails only NVIDIA, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon in market size. According to Morehead: “The global financial ecosystem is at an inflection point.” He attributed Bitcoin’s growth to increasing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption, led by firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity introducing accessible investment vehicles. Pantera highlighted recent developments accelerating Bitcoin’s adoption, including US regulatory advancements and growing institutional interest. According to Morehead, these factors could unlock trillions in additional capital inflows. He said: “Blockchain’s 15-year regulatory headwinds are turning into tailwinds.” Morehead predicted that Bitcoin’s market cap could swell to $15 trillion within the next decade, potentially driving the price to $740,000 per coin. He noted: “The transition from 5% adoption in 2024 to mass-market accessibility is just beginning.” Morehead also reflected on the broader implications of blockchain technology, saying: “We believe every major investment firm will soon have dedicated blockchain teams and permanent allocations. Despite its monumental growth, Bitcoin’s journey has been fraught with volatility. Morehead recalled the skepticism Pantera faced during Bitcoin’s 87% decline in 2013. He said: “It was hard to see the long-term vision back then. But as we’ve seen time and again, these cycles of doubt often precede transformative growth.” Pantera’s early commitment, including its acquisition of 2% of all Bitcoin in circulation, positioned the fund as a pioneer in blockchain investing. Bitcoin’s ascent reflects its growing role in democratizing finance. Morehead likened Bitcoin to gold in 1000 B.C., noting that 95% of global wealth has yet to adopt the asset. He said: “Blockchain represents the first global, borderless payment system. Its potential is orders of magnitude beyond anything we’ve seen in the traditional financial system.” As Bitcoin continues to mature, Pantera remains bullish on its ability to reshape the global economy. Morehead said: “We’re not just betting on Bitcoin. We’re betting on the future of financial inclusion and the promise of blockchain technology.” At the time of press 6:57 pm UTC on Nov. 26, 2024, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is down 2.59% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $1.83 trillion with a 24-hour trading volume of $95.09 billion.

Title: Former model who caused mum-of-two’s death in crash after day long drinking session warned she faces jail

Jennifer Thomas (46) pleaded guilty before Cork Circuit Criminal Court to dangerous driving causing the death of Sheila Dunne (54). Jennifer Thomas. Photo: Michael MacSweeney A FORMER model whose dangerous driving caused the death of special needs assistant Sheila Dunne (50) was warned she faces a prison sentence after she drove her jeep following a day-long drink-fuelled social outing. Mother-of-three Jennifer Thomas (46) wept as Cork Circuit Criminal Court heard that she had consumed 12 drinks over the course of one afternoon in Douglas, Blackrock and Glanmire restaurants and pubs including one Prosecco, one Mimosa, two Espresso Martinis, four gin and tonics and four glasses of red wine. Judge Helen Boyle was told by Det Garda Mark Durkan that, during her attempt to drive home, the defendant fell asleep behind the steering wheel twice at traffic lights, narrowly missed a pedestrian, ran over several traffic cones, undertook two U-turns and drove on the wrong side of the road. When questioned after the collision by Gardaí, Ms Thomas said initially that she had been behind the wheel - but then suggested that mother-of-two Sheila Dunne, who was in the front passenger seat of the commercial jeep, may have been driving as she had "more control". Sheila Dunne died in Cork University Hospital (CUH) on February 13, 2024 One witness at the collision scene said Ms Thomas was in a very agitated state and kept repeating: "How can I live without her? Please (Sheila) wake up." Two other motorists were so concerned at the condition of Ms Thomas' driving minutes earlier that they tried in vain to get her to pull over and park her vehicle - while another followed her in a bid to alert gardaí. At one traffic light, she fell asleep behind the wheel while stopped for over eight minutes - with other vehicles having to drive around her jeep. Judge Boyle was told that Ms Thomas made a serious attempt on her life in the months after the death of her friend of over 20 years and believes she will never be forgiven for what happened. A letter of apology was submitted to the court but this was rejected by the Dunne family as being offered too late. Defence counsel Tom Creed SC read the letter to the court. "I deeply regret my behaviour and what happened," she said. "What I did was wrong...I am truly sorry in more ways than I can explain." Ms Thomas also apologised for contacting the Dunne family after the tragedy in "a selfish request for forgiveness." In an emotional victim impact statement, delivered on behalf of Mrs Dunne's children, Lilley and TJ, who were left orphaned by the tragedy, the court was told the two children were left with "shattered hearts" because of the selfish and reckless actions of Ms Thomas. Thomas of Oakfield View, Glanmire, Co Cork pleaded guilty before Cork Circuit Criminal Court to dangerous driving causing the death of Sheila Dunne (50) on the L2973 road at Sarsfield Court in Glanmire on February 11, 2024. The charge was brought contrary to Section 53 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961. The model, who appeared in court wearing a black coat and pants suit, sobbed with her head in her hands as the victim impact statements were delivered in person by Lilley Dunne and on behalf of Sheila's mother, Esther O'Brien (74), by Sheila Lee. Lilley told the court that her brother, TJ, has autism and is non-verbal. "I stand before you here today as TJ's voice and to outline the devastation we have both endured," she said. "I have come here with a shattered heart weighed down so heavily by this. "I wanted to try to try and express as vividly as I can how this tragic event has destroyed my life, my brother's world and our family unit as we knew it." She said her mother always referred to TJ as "the best boy in the whole world" - and she is absolutely heartbroken when TJ asks: 'I want Mommy please'." The young woman said she tries to console her brother by saying their mother and father are together "up in the sky." Lilley said her family felt they had endured "a cruel twist of fate" after losing their mother just a few years after losing their father to Covid-19. "My beautiful mother was taken from us far too soon at the young age of 50 in a car crash caused by a reckless decision made by a selfish individual. This choice altered our lives forever. "I have known Jennifer for many years. It haunts me that on the day of the car crash I repeatedly tried to contact Jennifer as I couldn't get through to my Mam as her phone was flat. "I felt a huge worry as it was totally out of character for my Mam. "It was later verified to me that Jennifer's phone was not flat and so I could only feel as though I was being ignored. "The betrayal I feel is indescribable and it has broken my sense of safety and trust in everyone." She said her family were told at one point that Sheila was driving the car. "I never believed this and this made an unimaginable tragedy even more painful for me and my family." Lilley said she allowed Ms Thomas to visit her mother at Cork University Hospital (CUH) where she was in a critical condition in the days before her death. "Knowing what I know now, my decision would have been different. "Jennifer's malicious lies trickled out to the media vultures compounding our grief. Newspapers and social media outlets covered the story and reported that my Mam was the driver. "Jennifer's complete fabrication painted a picture of my Mam, Sheila, that was far from the truth, sensationalising the tragedy and stripping away her dignity and worsening our family's suffering. "It is heartbreaking to see how easily someone's untruthful words can overshadow all the goodness and integrity my Mam embodied." Lilley said that Ms Thomas' false claims had turned her mother's death "into a spectacle." Ms Thomas offered an apology in court to the Dunne family but they said it was offered far too late to be accepted. "She (Jennifer) asked for forgiveness but never took responsibility for her careless actions. She never said sorry." Lilley said her mother's death has been most painfully felt by her brother, TJ, for whom Sheila was his primary carer. "It is impossible to gauge the extent of the trauma he has endured from this." "Our Mam's death is a hole that no amount of time or apology can ever fill and no justice will bring her back." Sheila's mother, Esther O'Brien (74), said the collision had inflicted "profound emotional scars on all of us." "My granddaughter Lilley was left with no choice but to step up and care for her younger brother, TJ. While I am so proud of Lilley for being such an amazingly strong young girl, it breaks my heart to see the sacrifices she has had to make and the lost opportunities (she had)." Other charges against Ms Thomas, including one count of drunk driving and three counts of dangerous driving, will remain at the district court as they are deemed to be summary charges. The summary charges include that Ms Thomas was under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle at Sarsfield Court, dangerous driving at Hazelwood Road, Sarsfield Court and Sallybrook, not having a driving licence and the related count of failing to produce it. Det Garda Mark Durkan told the court that Jennifer Thomas pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. The defendant was driving her two seat commercial jeep with Sheila Dunne as a front seat passenger when the tragedy occurred. Ms Thomas had driven after consuming 12 drinks over the course of a social day out. After a series of near-misses on earlier stretches of road, the two-seat jeep entered a sharp left hand bend near Sarsfield Court but never straightened out, struck the ditch and overturned on the driver's side. Ms Thomas was wearing a seat belt but Sheila Dunne was not. The special needs assistant was then catapulted across onto her friend, suffering serious injuries and later having a cardiac arrest which in turn resulted in a critical brain injury. Sheila Dunne died in Cork University Hospital (CUH) on February 13. The special needs assistant was originally from Limerick and was predeceased by her husband, Ted. Lilley said it was doubly heartbreaking for her and TJ that, having watched their father die from Covid-19 after being on life support in February 2021, they had to watch their mother similarly pass away after being on life support at CUH last February. The fatal collision occurred just 1.2km from the Dunne family home and Lilley said she can no longer travel the route because of the memories of her mother. Mr Creed said that Ms Thomas had made a serious attempt on her life after being wracked by guilt over what happened. "It has had a severe psychological effect on her. She feels extreme guilt over what she has done. Her remorse is genuine," he said. Judge Boyle was told that Ms Thomas has ten previous convictions, seven for Road Traffic Act offences. The judge adjourned sentencing to allow her to consider the various expert reports. "This will attract a custodial sentence so I will remand her in custody to Thursday," Judge Boyle said.

Trump's campaign promises — from tariffs to mass deportations, tax cuts and deregulation — and his picks to lead federal agencies suggest both risks and rewards for various investment sectors, according to market experts. Republican control of both chambers of Congress may grant Trump greater leeway to enact his pledges, experts said. However, their scope and timing is far from clear. Here's a look at other stories impacting the financial advisor business. "There's so much uncertainty right now," said Jeremy Goldberg, a certified financial planner, portfolio manager and research analyst at Professional Advisory Services, which ranked No. 37 on CNBC's annual Financial Advisor 100 list. "I wouldn't be making large bets one way or another," Goldberg said. Past market results show why it's difficult to predict the sectors that may win or lose under a new president, according to Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James. When Trump was elected in 2016, financials, industrials and energy outperformed the S&P 500 in the first week. However, for the remaining three years and 51 weeks, those same sectors significantly underperformed, Adam said. "The market is known to have these knee-jerk reactions trying to anticipate where things go very quickly, but they don't necessarily last," Adam said. What's more, sectors that are expected to do well or badly based on a president's policies have sometimes gone the opposite way, according to Adam. For example, the energy sector was down by 8.4% during Trump's first administration, despite deregulation, record oil production and a rise in oil prices. Yet the energy sector climbed 22.9% under Biden as of Nov. 19, despite the administration's push for renewables and sustainability. For that reason, Raymond James ranks politics eighth for its potential impact on sectors. The seven factors that have more influence, according to the firm, are economic growth, fundamentals, monetary policy, interest rates and inflation, valuations, sentiment and corporate activity. Here's how Trump's policy stances could influence eight sectors: autos, banks, building materials and construction, cryptocurrency, energy, health care, retail and technology. The auto sector — like many others — will likely be a mixed bag, experts said. Trump's antipathy for electric vehicles is likely to create headwinds for EV producers. His administration may try to roll back regulations such as a Biden-era tailpipe-emissions rule expected to push broader adoption of EVs and hybrids. He also intends to kill consumer EV tax credits worth up to $7,500 — although states such as California may try to enact their own EV rebates, blunting the impact. Losing the federal credit would make EVs more costly, driving down sales and perhaps making "per unit economics even less favorable" for automakers, John Murphy, a research analyst at Bank of America Securities, wrote in a Nov. 21 research note. Some companies seem well-positioned, though: Ford Motor, for example, "has a healthy pipeline of hybrid vehicles as well as traditional [internal combustion engine] vehicles to supplement the EV offerings," Murphy wrote. Tariffs and trade conflict pose threats to the auto industry, since the U.S. relies heavily on other nations to manufacture cars and parts, said Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management. They "could affect the cost and availability of cars we see in the U.S. market," Cox said. Economists expect tariffs and other Trump policies to be inflationary. In that case, the Federal Reserve may have to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated. Higher borrowing costs may weigh on consumers' desire or ability to buy cars, Cox said. However, lower EV production could be a boon for companies that manufacture traditional gasoline cars, experts said. Trump has also called for a "drill, baby, drill" approach to oil production. Greater supply could reduce gas prices, supporting demand for gas vehicles, experts said. But trade wars and sanctions on Iran and Venezuela could have the opposite impact, too. — Greg Iacurci Trump's first administration eased certain regulations for banking rules, fintech firms and financial startups. Likewise, Trump's second term is expected to usher in lighter financial regulations. That may help bolster profitability in the sector, and therefore stock prices, said Brian Spinelli, co-chief investment officer at Halbert Hargrove in Long Beach, California, which is No. 54 on the 2024 CNBC FA 100 list. "The larger banks probably benefit more from that," Spinelli said. Less regulation — combined with the prospect that interest rates could stay higher — will provide a net positive for the bank industry, since banks may be able to lend out more risk-based capital, said David Rea, president of Salem Investment Counselors in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which is No. 8 on the 2024 CNBC FA 100 list. One issue that emerged this year that could resurface is concern about regional banks' exposure to commercial real estate, Spinelli said. "It wasn't that long ago, and I don't think those problems disappeared," Spinelli said. "So you question, is that still looming out there?" — Lorie Konish The housing market has been "frozen" in recent years by high mortgage rates, said Cox, of Ritholtz. Lower rates would likely be a "catalyst" for housing and associated companies, she said. However, that may not materialize — quickly, at least — under Trump, she said. If policies such as tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportations stoke inflation, the Federal Reserve may have to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated, which would likely prop up mortgage rates and weigh on housing and related sectors, she said. The whims of the housing market affect retailers, too: Home goods stores may not fare well if people aren't buying, renovating and decorating new homes, Cox said. That said, deregulation could be "absolutely huge" for the sector if it accelerates building timelines and reduces costs for developers, Goldberg said. Trump has called for opening public land to builders and creating tax incentives for homebuyers, without providing much detail. Housing policy will be "one of the most-watched initiatives coming out of the next administration," Cox said. "We haven't gotten a lot of clarity on that front." "If we see realistic and well-thought-out policies, you could see real estate stocks and related stocks" such as real estate investment trusts, home improvement retailers and home builders respond well, Cox said. — Greg Iacurci Trump's election has brought a new bullishness to cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin nearing a new $100,000 benchmark before its recent runup ended. As president, Trump is expected to embrace crypto more than any of his predecessors. Notably, he has already launched a crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, that will encourage the use of digital coins. Those developments come as new ways of investing in crypto have emerged this year, with the January launch of spot bitcoin ETFs, and more recently, the addition of bitcoin ETF options. Yet financial advisors are hesitant, with only about 2.6% recommending crypto to their clients, an April survey from Cerulli Associates found. Roughly 12.1% said they would be willing to use it or discuss it based on the client's preference. Still, 58.9% of advisors said they do not expect to ever use cryptocurrency with clients. "The No. 1 reason why advisors aren't investing in cryptocurrency on behalf of their clients is they don't believe it's suitable for client portfolios," said Matt Apkarian, associate director in Cerulli's product development practice. Even for advisors who do expect they may use crypto at some point, it's "wait and see," particularly regarding how the regulatory environment plays out, Apkarian said. However, investors are showing interest in cryptocurrency, with 90% of advisors receiving questions on the subject, according to research from Christina Lynn, a certified financial planner and practice management consultant at Mariner Wealth Advisors. For those investors, exchange-traded funds are a good starting place, Lynn said, since there's less chance of falling victim to one of crypto's pitfalls such as scams or losing the keys, the unique alphanumeric codes attached to the investments. Because crypto can be more volatile, it's best not to invest any money you expect you'll need to pay for near-term goals, she said. Investors would also be wise to think of cryptocurrency like an alternative investment and limit the allocation to 1% to 5% of their overall portfolio, Lynn said. "You don't need to have a lot of this to have it go a long way," Lynn said. — Lorie Konish As of Nov. 19, energy has been the top-performing sector under President Joe Biden, with a 22.9% gain, even with the administration's push for renewables and sustainability, according to Raymond James. Yet it remains to be seen whether that performance can continue under Trump, who has advocated for more oil, gas and coal production. The outlook for the sector could change if Trump acts on a campaign threat to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, a law enacted under Biden that includes clean energy incentives. If Trump continues to make it easier to create more oil supply, that might not be a great thing for oil companies, according to Adam, of Raymond James. "Because there's more supply, it may tamp down on the price of oil, and that's one of the biggest drivers of that sector," Adam said. Eagle Global Advisors, a Houston-based investment management firm that specializes in energy infrastructure, is "cautiously optimistic" about Trump's impact on the sector, according to portfolio manager Mike Cerasoli. Eagle Global Advisors is No. 35 on the 2024 CNBC FA 100 list. "We would say we're probably more on the optimistic side than the cautious side," Cerasoli said. "But if we know anything about Trump it's that he's a wild card." A lot of the Inflation Reduction Act may stay intact, since the top states that benefited financially from the law also handed Trump a victory in the election, according to Cerasoli. When Biden won in 2020, there was a lot of panic about the outlook for energy, oil and gas. Cerasoli recalls writing in a third-quarter letter that year, "I don't think it's going to be as bad as you think." Four years later, he has the same message for investors on the outlook for renewables. In the days following Trump's inauguration, Cerasoli expects there may be a deluge of executive orders. "Once you get past that, you'll get a sense of exactly how he's going to treat energy," Cerasoli said. "I think people will realize that it's not the end of the world for renewables." — Lorie Konish Trump nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services. RFK would be a "huge wild card" for the health-care sector if the U.S. Senate were to confirm him, said Goldberg, of Professional Advisory Services. RFK is a prominent vaccine skeptic, which may bode ill for big vaccine makers such as Merck, Pfizer and Moderna, said David Weinstein, a portfolio manager and senior vice president at Dana Investment Advisors, No. 4 on CNBC's annual FA 100 ranking. Cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, are also likely on the table to reduce government spending and raise money for a tax-cut package, experts said. Publicly traded health companies such as Centene, HCA Healthcare and UnitedHealth might be affected by lower volumes of Medicaid patients or consumers who face higher health-care premiums after losing ACA subsidies, for example, Weinstein said. Medical tech providers — especially those that supply electronics with semiconductors sourced from China — could be burdened by tariffs, he added. Conversely, deregulation might help certain pharmaceutical companies such as Thermo Fisher Scientific and Charles River Laboratories, which may benefit from faster approvals from the Food and Drug Administration, Goldberg said. Vivek Ramaswamy, a former biotech executive whom Trump appointed as co-head of a new advisory panel called the "Department of Government Efficiency," has called for streamlined drug approvals. But Kennedy has advocated for more oversight. "There's a real dichotomy here," Weinstein said. "Where do we end up? Maybe where we are right now," he added. — Greg Iacurci Tax cuts may boost consumers' discretionary income, which would be a boon for companies selling consumer electronics, clothes, luxury goods and other items, Goldberg said. Then again, there's a "high probability" of tariffs, Weinstein said. Retailers would likely pass on at least some of that additional cost to consumers, experts said. All physical goods, from apparel to footwear, tools and appliances are at risk from tariffs, Weinstein said. Tariff impact would depend on how the policies are structured. Home Depot, Lowe's and Walmart, for example, source a relatively big chunk of their goods from abroad, Weinstein said. Home Depot CEO and President Ted Decker said Nov. 12 during the firm's third-quarter earnings call that the company sources more than half its goods from the U.S. and North America, but "there certainly will be an impact." "Whatever happens in tariffs will be an industrywide impact," Decker said. "It won't discriminate against different retailers and distributors who are importing goods." It's a good idea for investors to own "high quality" retailers without a lot of debt and with diversified inventory sources, Goldberg said. He cited TJX Companies, which owns stores including TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, as an example. "Direct imports are a small portion of [its] business and TJX sources from a variety of countries outside of China," Lorraine Hutchinson, a Bank of America Securities research analyst, wrote in a Nov. 21 note. Deregulation may be positive for smaller retailers and franchises, which tend to be more sensitive to labor laws and environmental and compliance costs, Goldberg said. — Greg Iacurci The technology sector continued its strong run in 2024, thanks in large part to the Magnificent Seven — Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. Even broadly diversified investors may find it difficult to escape those names, as they are among the top weighted companies in the S&P 500 index. Information technology — which includes all those stocks except Amazon and Google parent Alphabet — comprises the largest sector in the S&P 500 index, with more than 31%. Trump is poised to have an influence on looming antitrust issues, amid considerations as to whether Google's influence on online search should be limited. Any tariffs put in place may also prompt some sales to decline or the cost of raw materials to go up, said Rea of Salem Investment Counselors. Nevertheless, Rea said his firm continues to have a "pretty heavy" tech allocation, with strong expectations for generative artificial intelligence. However, the firm does not own Tesla, due to its expensive valuation, and has recently been selling software company Palantir, a winning stock that may have gotten ahead of itself, he said. Technology valuations are trading well into the high double digits on a price-to-earnings basis, which often signals forward returns will decline, according to Halbert Hargrove's Spinelli. Consequently, prospective investors who come in now would basically be buying high, he said. "If you think you're going to get the same double-digit returns in the next five years, sure, it could happen on a one-year basis," Spinelli said. "But your chances historically have been that your returns come down." — Lorie Konish Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Trump's campaign promises — from tariffs to mass deportations, tax cuts and deregulation — and his picks to lead federal agencies suggest both risks and rewards for various investment sectors, according to market experts. Republican control of both chambers of Congress may grant Trump greater leeway to enact his pledges, experts said. However, their scope and timing is far from clear. Here's a look at other stories impacting the financial advisor business. "There's so much uncertainty right now," said Jeremy Goldberg, a certified financial planner, portfolio manager and research analyst at Professional Advisory Services, which ranked No. 37 on CNBC's annual Financial Advisor 100 list. "I wouldn't be making large bets one way or another," Goldberg said. Past market results show why it's difficult to predict the sectors that may win or lose under a new president, according to Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James. When Trump was elected in 2016, financials, industrials and energy outperformed the S&P 500 in the first week. However, for the remaining three years and 51 weeks, those same sectors significantly underperformed, Adam said. "The market is known to have these knee-jerk reactions trying to anticipate where things go very quickly, but they don't necessarily last," Adam said. What's more, sectors that are expected to do well or badly based on a president's policies have sometimes gone the opposite way, according to Adam. For example, the energy sector was down by 8.4% during Trump's first administration, despite deregulation, record oil production and a rise in oil prices. Yet the energy sector climbed 22.9% under Biden as of Nov. 19, despite the administration's push for renewables and sustainability. For that reason, Raymond James ranks politics eighth for its potential impact on sectors. The seven factors that have more influence, according to the firm, are economic growth, fundamentals, monetary policy, interest rates and inflation, valuations, sentiment and corporate activity. Here's how Trump's policy stances could influence eight sectors: autos, banks, building materials and construction, cryptocurrency, energy, health care, retail and technology. The auto sector — like many others — will likely be a mixed bag, experts said. Trump's antipathy for electric vehicles is likely to create headwinds for EV producers. His administration may try to roll back regulations such as a Biden-era tailpipe-emissions rule expected to push broader adoption of EVs and hybrids. He also intends to kill consumer EV tax credits worth up to $7,500 — although states such as California may try to enact their own EV rebates, blunting the impact. Losing the federal credit would make EVs more costly, driving down sales and perhaps making "per unit economics even less favorable" for automakers, John Murphy, a research analyst at Bank of America Securities, wrote in a Nov. 21 research note. Some companies seem well-positioned, though: Ford Motor, for example, "has a healthy pipeline of hybrid vehicles as well as traditional [internal combustion engine] vehicles to supplement the EV offerings," Murphy wrote. Tariffs and trade conflict pose threats to the auto industry, since the U.S. relies heavily on other nations to manufacture cars and parts, said Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management. They "could affect the cost and availability of cars we see in the U.S. market," Cox said. Economists expect tariffs and other Trump policies to be inflationary. In that case, the Federal Reserve may have to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated. Higher borrowing costs may weigh on consumers' desire or ability to buy cars, Cox said. However, lower EV production could be a boon for companies that manufacture traditional gasoline cars, experts said. Trump has also called for a "drill, baby, drill" approach to oil production. Greater supply could reduce gas prices, supporting demand for gas vehicles, experts said. But trade wars and sanctions on Iran and Venezuela could have the opposite impact, too. — Greg Iacurci Trump's first administration eased certain regulations for banking rules, fintech firms and financial startups. Likewise, Trump's second term is expected to usher in lighter financial regulations. That may help bolster profitability in the sector, and therefore stock prices, said Brian Spinelli, co-chief investment officer at Halbert Hargrove in Long Beach, California, which is No. 54 on the 2024 CNBC FA 100 list. "The larger banks probably benefit more from that," Spinelli said. Less regulation — combined with the prospect that interest rates could stay higher — will provide a net positive for the bank industry, since banks may be able to lend out more risk-based capital, said David Rea, president of Salem Investment Counselors in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which is No. 8 on the 2024 CNBC FA 100 list. One issue that emerged this year that could resurface is concern about regional banks' exposure to commercial real estate, Spinelli said. "It wasn't that long ago, and I don't think those problems disappeared," Spinelli said. "So you question, is that still looming out there?" — Lorie Konish The housing market has been "frozen" in recent years by high mortgage rates, said Cox, of Ritholtz. Lower rates would likely be a "catalyst" for housing and associated companies, she said. However, that may not materialize — quickly, at least — under Trump, she said. If policies such as tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportations stoke inflation, the Federal Reserve may have to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated, which would likely prop up mortgage rates and weigh on housing and related sectors, she said. The whims of the housing market affect retailers, too: Home goods stores may not fare well if people aren't buying, renovating and decorating new homes, Cox said. That said, deregulation could be "absolutely huge" for the sector if it accelerates building timelines and reduces costs for developers, Goldberg said. Trump has called for opening public land to builders and creating tax incentives for homebuyers, without providing much detail. Housing policy will be "one of the most-watched initiatives coming out of the next administration," Cox said. "We haven't gotten a lot of clarity on that front." "If we see realistic and well-thought-out policies, you could see real estate stocks and related stocks" such as real estate investment trusts, home improvement retailers and home builders respond well, Cox said. — Greg Iacurci Trump's election has brought a new bullishness to cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin nearing a new $100,000 benchmark before its recent runup ended. As president, Trump is expected to embrace crypto more than any of his predecessors. Notably, he has already launched a crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, that will encourage the use of digital coins. Those developments come as new ways of investing in crypto have emerged this year, with the January launch of spot bitcoin ETFs, and more recently, the addition of bitcoin ETF options. Yet financial advisors are hesitant, with only about 2.6% recommending crypto to their clients, an April survey from Cerulli Associates found. Roughly 12.1% said they would be willing to use it or discuss it based on the client's preference. Still, 58.9% of advisors said they do not expect to ever use cryptocurrency with clients. "The No. 1 reason why advisors aren't investing in cryptocurrency on behalf of their clients is they don't believe it's suitable for client portfolios," said Matt Apkarian, associate director in Cerulli's product development practice. Even for advisors who do expect they may use crypto at some point, it's "wait and see," particularly regarding how the regulatory environment plays out, Apkarian said. However, investors are showing interest in cryptocurrency, with 90% of advisors receiving questions on the subject, according to research from Christina Lynn, a certified financial planner and practice management consultant at Mariner Wealth Advisors. For those investors, exchange-traded funds are a good starting place, Lynn said, since there's less chance of falling victim to one of crypto's pitfalls such as scams or losing the keys, the unique alphanumeric codes attached to the investments. Because crypto can be more volatile, it's best not to invest any money you expect you'll need to pay for near-term goals, she said.

According to InvestingPro data, BIGZ currently boasts a substantial dividend yield of 13.0%, with the most recent ex-dividend date on November 15, 2024. This high yield could be a key factor in Saba Capital's decision to increase its stake, as it offers a significant income stream for shareholders.

Title: Bitcoin is Solidified Happiness

Happy Bitcoin! Audio Happiness is forever, if in a Bitcoin! — Do you want to be happy or happier, the best way to do it is to purchase accumulate and acquire bitcoin, like taking your economic happiness and energy, and putting it into an infallible bitcoin. So assuming that you’re living in Mexico City, Thailand, Vietnam Cambodia Laos, off the grid, and you love being off the grid, not being tied down by anything… Bitcoin is the ultimate freedom energy economic power property you can own. For example, I think one critical mistake a lot of millennials make is they want to buy some sort of like weird off-roading Mercedes sprinter van, and they essentially like a homeless people in RV parks? So for myself, I’ve always had a passion for nontraditional idea paths etc. To be contrarian means to just go against the herd. So for example, even though I’m a huge fan of Tesla and Elon Musk, am I the only successful millennial person individual, super rich who would actually prefer having a Toyota Prius or maybe now, the Lexus TX car? I think there’s a lot of press about you being able to camp and live in a cyber truck, and I think it’s a great idea, but, I find it actually much more practical to get like maybe a Lexus TX Plugin hybrid car, the ultimate luxury SUV minivan, and just sleep and live in the trunk of that? The side is once again, the plug-in hybrid concept is still the most best double leverage thing you can get; the side of gasoline, which power is like 90% of humanity, and also, electricity, the Hybrid engine, as well as the plug-in capability. Something that people don’t really talk about is that the upside of having a hybrid car is that when you idle, most often times it is silent. This is phenomenally fantastic if you’re taking a nap in the car with your kid! No solo gasoline car is worth it; either hybrid, plug-in hybrid or nothing. ￼ Once again, even today… We are still stuck in this slave like mentality of vehicle ownership. I suppose the good thing about having an old Prius is that it never feels like a liability. If somebody steals it, hit it I could care less. Also pro tip, if you have peeling paint or something on your car, just order some 3M matte black vinyl vehicle wrap online, cut it yourself and just stick it on like a sticker! Looks very cool. Another funny trend, everyone in LA wants to murder at their cars in all black, but, this is a positively bad idea because Los Angeles is essentially a desert with lots of dirt particles in the air, the ideal car color is either white or some sort of desert tan color; any color which does not show dirt. And also a lot of these fools don’t understand is that if you have a black vehicle, you’re going to get cooked alive in the summertime! The funny thing is actually… When I was a kid growing up, nobody wanted to own a black car. A sports car was universally red; everyone wanted the red Integra type R, with the gloss white rims. I could care less about your four bitcoin Ferrari, or your two bitcoin Lamborghini. Or your one bitcoin cyber truck. What is super interesting and fasting about bitcoin is that it is almost like wealth on wheels. And only that but it is like the ultimate type of wealth and property you could actually own. Why? It is like perpetually in your mind in your head and your soul; and it is not physical, yet it is real and exists. A lot of people don’t understand what this point is, they think that it is fake money. But no, bitcoin is digital cyber capital, which is 1 trillion times more profound as an idea. Why? If you could teleport a skyscraper into cyberspace, make it immortal, immutable, indefinitely divisible, with no property tax, no mayor trying to put regulations on you, no death in decay, no annoying tenants etc.… You essentially have perfected digital and cyber capital And property. ￼ Traditionally, in the past, you only purchased real estate not for the utility purposes, but rather, as a long-term store value and or maybe income generation? The difficult thing is at best, you have to skillfully manage your real estate and property, get good tenants, collect the rent, but still you might have to deal with Insurance, things breaking, changing zoning laws in your local city or area, etc. I think this is a hard thing for a lot of people to understand is that you cannot tax bitcoin, only if you sell it. But if you never intend to sell it, you will never actually incur a capital gains tax, and even greater… The amazing thing about bitcoin is that assuming that it is digital property, you don’t have to pay Property taxes for simply holding it and owning it. Let us say you buy a $2 million home in all cash, but still… Even with a nominal 1 to 1.25 or 1.5% property tax, you’re going to be paying like 2000, $2500, maybe even $3000 a month in property taxes, simply for owning the thing. And you’re going to have to pay that forever. ￼ This is kind of a scary thing… And it seems a little bit weird and unethical; if you own a piece of land, why do you need to pay taxes simply for the right of owning it? Like for example if I own a gold bar, in this gold bar is my property, I don’t have to pay 1% ￼tax on it, simply for owning it, forever? Even in some ways, maybe we consider inflation like an indirect tax on you. For example if you have like $1 million of cash just sitting in a checking account, the reason why this is bad is because it is draining economic energy like 15% a year. For example you’re $1 million worth of cash is going to degrade to like 750,000 the first year, $500,000 the next year, $250,000 the next year, down to $125k the next year etc. kind of a really bad situation. Volatility is energy power and vitality and vigor. Volatility is power! So for example, a nuclear reactor is very very volatile, but it is perhaps maybe one of the best blessings for humankind, because if managed in handled properly, it’s like free electricity and power for everyone forever. Bitcoin is like nuclear economic energy and power. Maybe people are afraid of bitcoin like they are afraid of nuclear power plants. Certainly we do not want a Fukushima,,, but still, certainly in the early adoption years of electricity, I’m sure that there are some people who accidentally electrified themselves to death. ￼ Also, I am also very certain in the early days of fire, there must have been some caveman who were burned to death. Or even the early water wheel, I’m sure there are some people who accidentally got crushed to death by it. But we do not ban these things simply because there were a handful of people who died from it. If you think about Satoshi like being Prometheus, who brought fire to the masses, isn’t this like the greatest blessing of all time? It seems that Michael Saylor and the like talk about Satoshi with some sort of extremely deep reverence. Even I was shocked. Also what becomes very interesting about bitcoin in general is that it definitely is starting to become like religious at this perspective. Like even beyond a cult. Religion. The immaculate conception of bitcoin, Satoshi, giving this gift to humanity, and essentially disappearing forever. Anybody who claims to be Satoshi, ignore them, they certainly are not. Why? Because 1, million bitcoins is essentially like worth what, $200 billion or something, essentially in the next upcoming months and years you’re going to see Satoshi becoming even richer than Elon Musk. And I’m very certain that within the next 5 to 10 years, you’re going to see Michael Saylor maybe being at least 2 to 3 times richer Than even Elon Musk. ￼ Anyways if you have that much energy power in wealth and bitcoins, you are not going to want to have anybody know who you are because realistically your life will probably be in peril. Very simple thing… He has literally almost like tripled my net worth in the matter of three months? There is no other human being on the planet who has ever directly or indirectly did this for me? And the reason why this is such a big deal is once again, now, as a consequence, the cost of living in LA becomes like a joke, really kind of not a big deal, I feel comfortable having 2, 3, 4 or even five kids. ￼￼ Another mistake that people make is that the point of becoming super rich is not to suddenly go out and buy a bunch of silly things. The purpose of the point is instead, to rather, live a more carefree life, less stress less anxieties less annoyance. Dropping $500 on beef ribs at Costco is just like a drop in the bucket. At this point the only money I spend on myself is my weightlifting equipment, my beef ribs, and maybe some new Vibram five fingers when my shoes fall apart. But besides this, I have like no use for money. And once again, the goal is to build in stack capital, we all live in capitalism, not “moneyism”. ERIC KIM CAPITAL a good ring to it. or ERIC KIM KAPITAL Ironically enough it is once again not really about consumerism, if you were a real capitalist, your joy is more in senior capital stack, not seeing it becoming depleted because you bought some sort of loser Ferrari or Porsche. I’m still shocked; 95% of water in America, we are simply being baited along by having some sort of allure of some sort of luxury vehicle but isn’t ideal to be like a digital nomad, traveling to Japan and Kyoto, visiting the Hot Springs, or living this luxurious Expat life in Cambodia Vietnam or Thailand? For example, my friend Todd Hata did it well, he sold his old house in the mountains in LA, and is essentially like on the road 90% of the year, jumping between Mexico City, Thailand, Greece etc. His passion has always been travel, and food and experiences, very wise. Even if you’re the average American, most people cannot afford to purchase physical property. And once again, if you do the math, after homeowners insurance, Tax, fire taxes, ￼ stuff breaking, having to change the roof, getting a new washer and dryer or dishwasher, upgrading your kitchen, you’re going to bleed yourself dry. And not only that but I think being a homeowner becomes a new consumerist things; spent too much time thinking about how to break down walls to extend your home, build an ADU, update the kitchen whatever. Or expanding your garden, changing the flooring etc. But don’t you realize that the best thing to do is just be in nature? Or just drive to the Huntington Gardens on the weekend, or just travel to Japan instead? In fact when you go on a flight, and you see all these little tiny homes From Birds Eye view, you realize how ridiculous the desire of homeownership is. I think real estate will be the next sector that bitcoin gobbles up. The average GenZ person doesn’t care for buying a house, they want to just play pickle ball, go hiking and camping, go on road trips, buy the newest iPhone etc. Pursue their hobbies and passions. Millennials, we are a funny basket case. We used to be like GenZ, wanting to travel to planet, become a digital nomad, etc.… But somewhere along the line, maybe because of Covid, we tried to settle down and buy single-family homes instead? Or condos? I’m starting to feel like this is the early the Internet, AOL, AOL 3.0, you got mail, dial up 56K modems etc. I also like bitcoin because it is just easier to mentally and mathematically remember things. Easier to remember how many bitcoins you have on the top of your head, rather than trying to tabulate all the ones and zeros of all your fake fiat based assets? Rather than thinking about your net worth, easier to just remember your net bitcoins; ￼ Whenever I find out that somebody else is into bitcoin, I have zero issues asking them how many bitcoins they own. Why? Because it is still a relatively new field, it is awkward to ask people how much US dollars they have in their savings account, or checking account, Easier to just ask the bitcoin question. And for me, even owning a single bitcoin is like for me, owning like a square block of digital Manhattan or Kyoto. You know these rich families that own huge plots of land in desirable locations? Yeah, that’s like bitcoin. A single-family home in Beverly Hills is what like at least 5 million, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million? 100,000,000? My personal projection is if you tag the price of a bitcoin to desirable real estate in the Brentwood Hills or something, just think about what the land is worth for the Getty museum. Or like owning a piece of land or property next to the PCH in Malibu. But actually if you think about it, the value of a single bitcoin is worth 1 trillion times more than even the best property in Malibu. Why? The dangers of owning physical property, landslides, Robberies, general maintenance. The fear that your housekeeper is stealing your stuff. For example, how comfortable are you leaving your $200,000 Rolex just sitting around? Probably not very comfortable. Bitcoin is the new family jewels. Take all of your scarce desirable assets like your Rolexes, your Leica, your Porsche and just buy bitcoin instead. Because once again , to have any sort of physical property in the physical realm is a liability not an asset. I’m starting to feel more bullish, increasing my target price of bitcoin to at least $55 million a coin. Probably higher. So if that’s the case, if you took a $10,000 Rolex, and sold it, assuming that bitcoin is around $95,000 of bitcoin right now, even lower at 89,000 of bitcoin or even $85,000 of bitcoin, whatever it may… Is massive upside. 611x The $6 million Rolex? Once again, so many of these things are just liabilities. I hate the fear of having to remember where I left it, and whether it is safe, whether it was stolen or not or whatever. Rather than putting your scarce desirable things into a physical vault, isn’t it far safer for it to be in a cyber Vault, on the Blockchain? What is the Blockchain,? It is like the cloud on steroids, with 1000 X more security power and cryptographic security. It took a long time for people to trust putting files on the cloud, or photos on the cloud, but now it seems like the obvious decision. I think the reason why I like Coinbase is that rather than having to memorize some keys in my head and have a hardware physical wallet, and knowing myself I am quite forgetful, you don’t want to lose like $1 billion worth of bitcoin because you forgot your password. I think this is also where this is a huge opportunity for Apple; if we have all of our bitcoin passwords and keys linked to our iCloud account, certainly we will never stop purchasing Apple devices. Even bigger, if Apple makes their own bitcoin ecosystem to custody your bitcoin in your Apple ID wallet, This could actually disrupt the whole Coinbase market. Let us consider that most of us have Apple Pay already enabled, how easy would it be to just buy bitcoin directly from your iPhone using Apple Pay? And it could be simple, you could just buy 10 bucks here, 20 bucks here, 50 bucks here, 100 bucks here etc. I don’t have an Apple credit card or bank account, but this seems like a good idea. I hate the weekends because the markets are closed. I would prefer a world in which my micro strategy stock could trade 24 7, 365, every day all day every day, on binance fidelity or something else. Apparently in 1933, the way that the traditional stock market was structured was actually to legitimately create a cartel. This is like the almost the exact opposite of American values of freedom, self sovereignty and freedom. Michael Saylor had a very interesting idea; why can you not own Apple stock directly on your Apple iPhone? There is nothing unethical about it. And technologically, we live in the year 2024 of course could be physically possible. Even the stock market is mostly driven by robots, you no longer have guys on the slips of paper. It ain’t like the Wolf of Wall Street. It’s like the wolf of cyber Wall Street.￼ Even here in Culver City, kind of like peak LA, there are so many businesses which are getting shut down like even me and Seneca’s beloved shake shack, and even more shockingly today, chipotle. If these trusted namebrand businesses are struggling in going out of business because we cannot afford to pay the rent or whatever… Isn’t this pretty bad? And also, physical entropy. Once again, if you want a physical house, shit will always break and you’re going to have to be liable for it. If you have an amazing landlord who always fixes everything super fast, even put in brand new appliances for you, leverage and milk that forever. Even we told our landlord that our washer washing machine had a little bit of rust in it, immediately sent in his team and installed a totally brand new Samsung washer and dryer , which might have caused like $5000 $6000? Even another thing that was interesting, there were some palm trees which were growing on top of the roof, and he just sent in a team to get it all cut down and fixed up? Even we had some issues with our electricity and water and water heater, once again he snapped his fingers and got it all resolved in a day or two, while me and Seneca having a fun adventure at the park. For myself, my core competency is within writing thinking blogging vlogging etc. ￼ from an economic perspective it kind of makes no sense for me to waste my time having to manage a home and fix things. I would rather manage thoughts ideas, big visions? When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Title: Bitcoin is Solidified Happiness
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2024/11/26/bitcoin-is-solidified-happiness-3/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T16:50:03Z
Full Content:
Do you want to be happy or happier, the best way to do it is to purchase accumulate and acquire bitcoin, like taking your economic happiness and energy, and putting it into an infallible bitcoin. So assuming that you’re living in Mexico City, Thailand, Vietnam Cambodia Laos, off the grid, and you love being off the grid, not being tied down by anything… Bitcoin is the ultimate freedom energy economic power property you can own. For example, I think one critical mistake a lot of millennials make is they want to buy some sort of like weird off-roading Mercedes sprinter van, and they essentially like a homeless people in RV parks? So for myself, I’ve always had a passion for nontraditional idea paths etc. To be contrarian means to just go against the herd. So for example, even though I’m a huge fan of Tesla and Elon Musk, am I the only successful millennial person individual, super rich who would actually prefer having a Toyota Prius or maybe now, the Lexus TX car? I think there’s a lot of press about you being able to camp and live in a cyber truck, and I think it’s a great idea, but, I find it actually much more practical to get like maybe a Lexus TX Plugin hybrid car, the ultimate luxury SUV minivan, and just sleep and live in the trunk of that? The side is once again, the plug-in hybrid concept is still the most best double leverage thing you can get; the side of gasoline, which power is like 90% of humanity, and also, electricity, the Hybrid engine, as well as the plug-in capability. Something that people don’t really talk about is that the upside of having a hybrid car is that when you idle, most often times it is silent. This is phenomenally fantastic if you’re taking a nap in the car with your kid! No solo gasoline car is worth it; either hybrid, plug-in hybrid or nothing. ￼ Once again, even today… We are still stuck in this slave like mentality of vehicle ownership. I suppose the good thing about having an old Prius is that it never feels like a liability. If somebody steals it, hit it I could care less. Also pro tip, if you have peeling paint or something on your car, just order some 3M matte black vinyl vehicle wrap online, cut it yourself and just stick it on like a sticker! Looks very cool. Another funny trend, everyone in LA wants to murder at their cars in all black, but, this is a positively bad idea because Los Angeles is essentially a desert with lots of dirt particles in the air, the ideal car color is either white or some sort of desert tan color; any color which does not show dirt. And also a lot of these fools don’t understand is that if you have a black vehicle, you’re going to get cooked alive in the summertime! The funny thing is actually… When I was a kid growing up, nobody wanted to own a black car. A sports car was universally red; everyone wanted the red Integra type R, with the gloss white rims. I could care less about your four bitcoin Ferrari, or your two bitcoin Lamborghini. Or your one bitcoin cyber truck. What is super interesting and fasting about bitcoin is that it is almost like wealth on wheels. And only that but it is like the ultimate type of wealth and property you could actually own. Why? It is like perpetually in your mind in your head and your soul; and it is not physical, yet it is real and exists. A lot of people don’t understand what this point is, they think that it is fake money. But no, bitcoin is digital cyber capital, which is 1 trillion times more profound as an idea. Why? If you could teleport a skyscraper into cyberspace, make it immortal, immutable, indefinitely divisible, with no property tax, no mayor trying to put regulations on you, no death in decay, no annoying tenants etc.… You essentially have perfected digital and cyber capital And property. ￼ Traditionally, in the past, you only purchased real estate not for the utility purposes, but rather, as a long-term store value and or maybe income generation? The difficult thing is at best, you have to skillfully manage your real estate and property, get good tenants, collect the rent, but still you might have to deal with Insurance, things breaking, changing zoning laws in your local city or area, etc. I think this is a hard thing for a lot of people to understand is that you cannot tax bitcoin, only if you sell it. But if you never intend to sell it, you will never actually incur a capital gains tax, and even greater… The amazing thing about bitcoin is that assuming that it is digital property, you don’t have to pay Property taxes for simply holding it and owning it. Let us say you buy a $2 million home in all cash, but still… Even with a nominal 1 to 1.25 or 1.5% property tax, you’re going to be paying like 2000, $2500, maybe even $3000 a month in property taxes, simply for owning the thing. And you’re going to have to pay that forever. ￼ This is kind of a scary thing… And it seems a little bit weird and unethical; if you own a piece of land, why do you need to pay taxes simply for the right of owning it? Like for example if I own a gold bar, in this gold bar is my property, I don’t have to pay 1% ￼tax on it, simply for owning it, forever? Even in some ways, maybe we consider inflation like an indirect tax on you. For example if you have like $1 million of cash just sitting in a checking account, the reason why this is bad is because it is draining economic energy like 15% a year. For example you’re $1 million worth of cash is going to degrade to like 750,000 the first year, $500,000 the next year, $250,000 the next year, down to $125k the next year etc. kind of a really bad situation. Volatility is energy power and vitality and vigor. Volatility is power! So for example, a nuclear reactor is very very volatile, but it is perhaps maybe one of the best blessings for humankind, because if managed in handled properly, it’s like free electricity and power for everyone forever. Bitcoin is like nuclear economic energy and power. Maybe people are afraid of bitcoin like they are afraid of nuclear power plants. Certainly we do not want a Fukushima,,, but still, certainly in the early adoption years of electricity, I’m sure that there are some people who accidentally electrified themselves to death. ￼ Also, I am also very certain in the early days of fire, there must have been some caveman who were burned to death. Or even the early water wheel, I’m sure there are some people who accidentally got crushed to death by it. But we do not ban these things simply because there were a handful of people who died from it. If you think about Satoshi like being Prometheus, who brought fire to the masses, isn’t this like the greatest blessing of all time? It seems that Michael Saylor and the like talk about Satoshi with some sort of extremely deep reverence. Even I was shocked. Also what becomes very interesting about bitcoin in general is that it definitely is starting to become like religious at this perspective. Like even beyond a cult. Religion. The immaculate conception of bitcoin, Satoshi, giving this gift to humanity, and essentially disappearing forever. Anybody who claims to be Satoshi, ignore them, they certainly are not. Why? Because 1, million bitcoins is essentially like worth what, $200 billion or something, essentially in the next upcoming months and years you’re going to see Satoshi becoming even richer than Elon Musk. And I’m very certain that within the next 5 to 10 years, you’re going to see Michael Saylor maybe being at least 2 to 3 times richer Than even Elon Musk. ￼ Anyways if you have that much energy power in wealth and bitcoins, you are not going to want to have anybody know who you are because realistically your life will probably be in peril. Very simple thing… He has literally almost like tripled my net worth in the matter of three months? There is no other human being on the planet who has ever directly or indirectly did this for me? And the reason why this is such a big deal is once again, now, as a consequence, the cost of living in LA becomes like a joke, really kind of not a big deal, I feel comfortable having 2, 3, 4 or even five kids. ￼￼ Another mistake that people make is that the point of becoming super rich is not to suddenly go out and buy a bunch of silly things. The purpose of the point is instead, to rather, live a more carefree life, less stress less anxieties less annoyance. Dropping $500 on beef ribs at Costco is just like a drop in the bucket. At this point the only money I spend on myself is my weightlifting equipment, my beef ribs, and maybe some new Vibram five fingers when my shoes fall apart. But besides this, I have like no use for money. And once again, the goal is to build in stack capital, we all live in capitalism, not “moneyism”. ERIC KIM CAPITAL a good ring to it. or ERIC KIM KAPITAL Ironically enough it is once again not really about consumerism, if you were a real capitalist, your joy is more in senior capital stack, not seeing it becoming depleted because you bought some sort of loser Ferrari or Porsche. I’m still shocked; 95% of water in America, we are simply being baited along by having some sort of allure of some sort of luxury vehicle but isn’t ideal to be like a digital nomad, traveling to Japan and Kyoto, visiting the Hot Springs, or living this luxurious Expat life in Cambodia Vietnam or Thailand? For example, my friend Todd Hata did it well, he sold his old house in the mountains in LA, and is essentially like on the road 90% of the year, jumping between Mexico City, Thailand, Greece etc. His passion has always been travel, and food and experiences, very wise. Even if you’re the average American, most people cannot afford to purchase physical property. And once again, if you do the math, after homeowners insurance, Tax, fire taxes, ￼ stuff breaking, having to change the roof, getting a new washer and dryer or dishwasher, upgrading your kitchen, you’re going to bleed yourself dry. And not only that but I think being a homeowner becomes a new consumerist things; spent too much time thinking about how to break down walls to extend your home, build an ADU, update the kitchen whatever. Or expanding your garden, changing the flooring etc. But don’t you realize that the best thing to do is just be in nature? Or just drive to the Huntington Gardens on the weekend, or just travel to Japan instead? In fact when you go on a flight, and you see all these little tiny homes From Birds Eye view, you realize how ridiculous the desire of homeownership is. I think real estate will be the next sector that bitcoin gobbles up. The average GenZ person doesn’t care for buying a house, they want to just play pickle ball, go hiking and camping, go on road trips, buy the newest iPhone etc. Pursue their hobbies and passions. Millennials, we are a funny basket case. We used to be like GenZ, wanting to travel to planet, become a digital nomad, etc.… But somewhere along the line, maybe because of Covid, we tried to settle down and buy single-family homes instead? Or condos? I’m starting to feel like this is the early the Internet, AOL, AOL 3.0, you got mail, dial up 56K modems etc. I also like bitcoin because it is just easier to mentally and mathematically remember things. Easier to remember how many bitcoins you have on the top of your head, rather than trying to tabulate all the ones and zeros of all your fake fiat based assets? Rather than thinking about your net worth, easier to just remember your net bitcoins; ￼ Whenever I find out that somebody else is into bitcoin, I have zero issues asking them how many bitcoins they own. Why? Because it is still a relatively new field, it is awkward to ask people how much US dollars they have in their savings account, or checking account, Easier to just ask the bitcoin question. And for me, even owning a single bitcoin is like for me, owning like a square block of digital Manhattan or Kyoto. You know these rich families that own huge plots of land in desirable locations? Yeah, that’s like bitcoin. A single-family home in Beverly Hills is what like at least 5 million, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million? 100,000,000? My personal projection is if you tag the price of a bitcoin to desirable real estate in the Brentwood Hills or something, just think about what the land is worth for the Getty museum. Or like owning a piece of land or property next to the PCH in Malibu. But actually if you think about it, the value of a single bitcoin is worth 1 trillion times more than even the best property in Malibu. Why? The dangers of owning physical property, landslides, Robberies, general maintenance. The fear that your housekeeper is stealing your stuff. For example, how comfortable are you leaving your $200,000 Rolex just sitting around? Probably not very comfortable. Bitcoin is the new family jewels. Take all of your scarce desirable assets like your Rolexes, your Leica, your Porsche and just buy bitcoin instead. Because once again , to have any sort of physical property in the physical realm is a liability not an asset. I’m starting to feel more bullish, increasing my target price of bitcoin to at least $55 million a coin. Probably higher. So if that’s the case, if you took a $10,000 Rolex, and sold it, assuming that bitcoin is around $95,000 of bitcoin right now, even lower at 89,000 of bitcoin or even $85,000 of bitcoin, whatever it may… Is massive upside. 611x The $6 million Rolex? Once again, so many of these things are just liabilities. I hate the fear of having to remember where I left it, and whether it is safe, whether it was stolen or not or whatever. Rather than putting your scarce desirable things into a physical vault, isn’t it far safer for it to be in a cyber Vault, on the Blockchain? What is the Blockchain,? It is like the cloud on steroids, with 1000 X more security power and cryptographic security. It took a long time for people to trust putting files on the cloud, or photos on the cloud, but now it seems like the obvious decision. I think the reason why I like Coinbase is that rather than having to memorize some keys in my head and have a hardware physical wallet, and knowing myself I am quite forgetful, you don’t want to lose like $1 billion worth of bitcoin because you forgot your password. I think this is also where this is a huge opportunity for Apple; if we have all of our bitcoin passwords and keys linked to our iCloud account, certainly we will never stop purchasing Apple devices. Even bigger, if Apple makes their own bitcoin ecosystem to custody your bitcoin in your Apple ID wallet, This could actually disrupt the whole Coinbase market. Let us consider that most of us have Apple Pay already enabled, how easy would it be to just buy bitcoin directly from your iPhone using Apple Pay? And it could be simple, you could just buy 10 bucks here, 20 bucks here, 50 bucks here, 100 bucks here etc. I don’t have an Apple credit card or bank account, but this seems like a good idea. I hate the weekends because the markets are closed. I would prefer a world in which my micro strategy stock could trade 24 7, 365, every day all day every day, on binance fidelity or something else. Apparently in 1933, the way that the traditional stock market was structured was actually to legitimately create a cartel. This is like the almost the exact opposite of American values of freedom, self sovereignty and freedom. Michael Saylor had a very interesting idea; why can you not own Apple stock directly on your Apple iPhone? There is nothing unethical about it. And technologically, we live in the year 2024 of course could be physically possible. Even the stock market is mostly driven by robots, you no longer have guys on the slips of paper. It ain’t like the Wolf of Wall Street. It’s like the wolf of cyber Wall Street.￼ When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Pantera Bitcoin Fund, one of the earliest Bitcoin-focused investment funds, has reached an extraordinary milestone with 1,000x returns, representing a lifetime gain of over 131,000%. In a blockchain letter shared on Pantera Capital’s website, Dan Morehead, Pantera Capital’s CEO, reflected on the fund’s success. He projected that Bitcoin could reach $740,000 by 2028, which would equate to a market cap of $15 trillion—an achievable figure within the context of $500 trillion in global financial assets. Morehead highlighted Bitcoin’s trajectory of achieving three orders of magnitude growth so far and suggested another order of magnitude is plausible. He also credited institutional involvement from major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity as pivotal drivers of the next wave of adoption. “Bitcoin is the first global currency since gold and the first borderless payment system ever,” he stated, highlighting its transformative potential. Founded in 2003 as a global macro hedge fund, Pantera Capital pivoted to digital assets in 2013 under Morehead’s leadership, launching the Pantera Bitcoin Fund. In its early years, the fund acquired 2% of the world’s Bitcoin supply, betting on its potential as a highly asymmetric trade. “The day we chose to launch Pantera Bitcoin Fund was literally the low print of the last eleven years,” Morehead reflected. In the blockchain letter, Morehead detailed the fund’s journey through emails and memos, offering insights into his evolving thoughts on Bitcoin at various stages of its growth. He compared early Bitcoin investments to buying gold in 1000 BC, underscoring its transformative role in global finance. Beyond its Bitcoin fund, Pantera Capital has driven blockchain innovation through strategic investments. It backed Coinbase, which reached an $85 billion valuation during its 2021 public listing, Alchemy, a leading blockchain development platform, and Bitso, a top Latin American cryptocurrency exchange.

Title: AI boom drives shares of sleepy Texas land firm up 200%
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/11/26/ai-boom-wild-west-landowner/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T16:12:48Z
Full Content:
The newest addition to the S&P 500 may be a relic of the Wild West, but its skyrocketing valuation is a byproduct of the AI boom. Founded in 1888, the Texas Pacific Land Corporation is a company that has just 100 employees but a market capitalization of more than $35 billion. For comparison, American Airlines, based in nearby Fort Worth, employs over 100,000 people and is worth roughly $10 billion. Texas Pacific Land Corporation, or TPL, began as a land trust but found itself sitting on “black gold” soon after oil was discovered in West Texas during the early 1900s. Recently, the company has begun exploring other ways to make money from its 873,000 acres, an area larger than Yosemite National Park. Betting that the region’s dirt-cheap natural gas will be a draw for America’s tech giants, TPL is luring renewable power projects, Bitcoin mines, and utility-scale battery production. Then there’s the possibility of data centers, which has helped TPL nearly triple its stock price in the past year. It remains to be seen whether the centers will become a fixture of the Permian Basin like oil pumps, but there’s no shortage of investor hype for companies that could capitalize on the energy boom needed to power the AI revolution. “TPL just has a lot of positive attributes for data centers, and nobody has more land than us in West Texas,” CEO Tyler Glover said on the company’s earnings call earlier this month. The company declined to provide further comment for a Bloomberg report on its data ambitions, but Glover said on the earnings call he believes TPL is well positioned to fill the need for land and water services as artificial intelligence opportunities unfold. “If we need to buy more land to accommodate a data center, then we’ve proven that’s not hard for us to do,” he said. “I think there’s also a lot of other parts of the country that are also attractive for data centers, so we’re working hard to make TPL as attractive as possible.” The bullish sentiment around TPL’s data ambitions is unsurprising given how Big Tech’s capital expenditures train doesn’t appear to be slowing anytime soon. According to data from Bloomberg Intelligence, Google parent company Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook parent Meta may spend more than a combined $200 billion next year amid the AI arms race. That means data center power demand in the U.S. could grow roughly 160% by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs, accounting for nearly a tenth of the country’s energy usage. “That kind of spike in power demand hasn’t been seen in the U.S. since the early years of this century,” the bank’s report said. This has prompted plenty of concerns about carbon emissions, and investors have joined the tech giants in trying to think ahead. With Big Tech beginning to ink deals for nuclear power, the top 10 performers in the S&P 500 this year include providers like Vistra (first), GE Vernova (fourth), and Constellation Energy (ninth), per Slickcharts. Demand for natural gas, often dubbed the world’s “cleanest fossil fuel,” also seems set to surge. It’s cheapest in West Texas, where a supply glut has caused prices to turn negative at the Waha Hub near the Permian Basin dozens of times this year. Managing overproduction is not an issue for TPL, which collected almost $100 million in oil and gas royalties last quarter from the likes of Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips while not paying anything to operate the actual wells. It’s no wonder investors have also flocked to fellow West Texas landowner Landbridge, which has seen its shares surge more than threefold since going public in June. Landbridge’s footprint in the Permian Basin is less than a third of TPL’s, however. The latter’s stock jumped 14% on Friday after the announcement that TPL would replace Marathon Oil, which has been acquired by ConocoPhillips, in the S&P 500. (TPL’s shares have shed much of that gain early this week, with the stock falling over 10% to trade around the $1,550 mark.) On a broader level, TPL’s newfound data ambitions punctuate the company’s remarkable evolution from a land-sale vehicle created to repay bondholders following the bankruptcy of Texas and Pacific Railway Co., which unsuccessfully tried to connect East Texas and San Diego. In time, the company would trade on the New York Stock Exchange in 1927 and, thanks to its lean operations and stock repurchases, would become a favorite of a young Warren Buffett. Today, unlike the value-first thesis of the Oracle of Omaha, many of TPL’s shareholders are seeking massive growth. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: How ‘Shogun’ Helped FX Find Its Footing as a Streaming Empire
URL: https://variety.com/2024/tv/features/how-shogun-helped-fx-networks-emmys-disney-1236223215/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
Six days before the debut of “Shōgun” last February, John Landgraf was worried about the “Endless Scroll.” Sitting with his feet propped up on a low table in his office on the Fox lot in Los Angeles, the longtime head of FX explained what he meant with his signature soft-spoken, brainy intensity. The “endless scroll” is not a talisman from “Shōgun” or an artifact of the Middle Ages but rather a symptom of our times. It refers to the never-ending stream of content that so many of us now have at our fingertips. When asked if he was worried viewers wouldn’t turn out for the most expensive production in the 30-year history of FX, Landgraf paused to think. Any butterflies he had about the show’s launch, he said finally, were wrapped up in his larger concern about the “endless scroll” effect that may be training us to have shorter and shorter attention spans. “You get 10, 15, maybe 25 seconds of somebody’s attention before they make a decision whether this is for them or not for them,” Landgraf said. “That’s the thing that I worry about most.” Related Stories VIP+ Packed Holiday Box Office Speaks to Misguided Scheduling Strategies Ludivine Sagnier to Serve on European Shooting Stars Jury, Alongside Director Radu Muntean, Producer Amel Soudani Following that thread, Landgraf fretted about the prospect that humans will gradually lose interest in the stuff that is his absolute jam: dense, novelistic, narrative storytelling as delivered via movies and TV series — like a lavish sword-and-kimono costume drama set among warring factions in 16th-century Japan. “The technologies enabled by computers and the internet are orders of magnitude bigger than almost any disruption we’ve ever seen, because they’re not just economic — they’re cognitive. They’re cultural,” Landgraf said. “They’re fundamentally transforming the way we live and the way we think and the way we learn.” This response is far removed from the typical hype and bombast that is the natural language of Hollywood executives. But Landgraf, 62, is far removed from a typical executive. “The culture that John has created at FX is very special,” says Justin Marks, who is showrunner and executive producer of “Shōgun” alongside his wife, Rachel Kondo. “You never feel like you’re working with people who are afraid of losing their jobs over one bad decision, which is incredibly rare these days.” At a time when traditional cable channels are trying to avoid extinction, Landgraf and the organization he has steered for 20 years is enjoying a resurgence that has been five years in the making. Led by the critical and commercial success of “Shōgun,” FX packed a wallop this year with a busy slate of originals including “The Bear,” “What We Do in the Shadows,” “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” “Reservation Dogs” and the latest iterations of “American Horror Story,” “Fargo” and “Feud.” Moreover, FX’s rebound started just when its parent company, Disney, needed some good news. “Shōgun” not only paid off on Disney’s considerable investment — estimated to be around $200 million for the production of Season 1 alone — but the show’s impact in the U.S. and key overseas territories helped quiet CEO Bob Iger’s critics as Disney’s stock price slumped. FX’s banner year was the proof Iger needed to counter the argument that he’d overpaid when he bought 21st Century Fox — which included the FX cable channel — for $71 billion in 2019. “Year after year, they’ve demonstrated that they not only have a keen eye for great creativity, but they have guts,” Iger says of Landgraf and his team. “You have to be fearless and willing to take big risks.” Iger had to back up his words of praise for the FX operation with Disney dollars shortly after the Disney-Fox deal closed in March 2019. “Shōgun” had been percolating in development at FX for years. Landgraf and FX Entertainment presidents Gina Balian and Nick Grad felt the project was finally ready and that FX could make a statement with a big, ambitious production. “A guy comes into your office and says, ‘I’d like to make a limited series set hundreds of years ago, and it will be virtually all in Japanese with a Japanese cast,’” Iger recalls with a chuckle. “How do you make that bet? You end up making that bet because you bet on John and his team.” RELATED CONTENT: ‘Shōgun’ — How a Decade of False Starts, Endless Debates and a Star-Turned-Producer Made a Classic Story Relevant Again “Shōgun” was the very first project that Balian commissioned for development after joining FX from HBO in 2012. Fortuitously, the series hit the airwaves right around the time that Iger was being publicly targeted in an activist investor campaign waged by Trian Partners’ Nelson Peltz — for the second time in two years. That was not a good look for Disney, a pillar of corporate America. If “Shōgun” had fizzled, it would have put even more pressure on Disney. “It was equal parts relief and exhilaration that it worked, because we’d bet the farm on it,” Landgraf says. The creative achievement of “Shōgun” was recognized with 18 Emmy Awards in September, which propelled FX past HBO and Netflix to lead the industry in total Emmy wins for the first time. It was a crowning moment for Landgraf and his tight-knit team. “What makes FX is John’s taste, his intelligence, his profound love for artists and creators, his storytelling sense and his almost encyclopedic knowledge of TV and film,” says Dana Walden, Disney Entertainment co-chairman who oversees FX and the rest of Disney’s TV operations (other than ESPN) including global streaming. “And onto that foundation you layer in a number of excellent executives who have been together for a very long time. That’s unique in the industry right now.” Walden has been a close colleague of Landgraf ’s for 25 years. Beyond award-season bragging rights, the success of “Shogun” helped reinforce FX’s role as a content engine driving Disney’s adult streaming strategy for Hulu and Disney+. “We proved to ourselves that we can do it,” Balian says. “With all the marketing and the publicity planning and a real worldwide launch – our teams figured out how to navigate this huge system that has so much to offer in terms of support. We learned a lot about how to market and launch a show like that.” And somehow, it seems fitting that it took a series that looks back 500 years in history to help FX find its way forward. “You couldn’t make ‘Shōgun’ for anything other than a global streaming platform. You need a global audience to amortize the cost,” Landgraf says. “We proved that Disney should be making this kind of programming. But we didn’t do it without them. We made it with them, and we distributed it with them. And it worked.” For Team FX, the path to figuring out how it would settle into the Disney universe was complicated by the internal drama that seized the media giant during Bob Chapek’s short tenure as CEO from 2020 through November 2022. (Iger had stepped down as CEO in February 2020.) The post-merger integration process that began under Iger in 2019 had already been humbling for FX. The company had been accustomed to having a lot of autonomy under the Fox regime. “We went from being an actual business that we managed to essentially a cost center inside Disney’s larger organization,” Landgraf said. The radical restructuring of Disney’s network and studio operations that Chapek subsequently implemented also created a lot of internal agita and speed bumps. Iger restructured the restructuring the moment he returned to power in November of 2022. The Chapek plan “was done in good faith, but it was very challenging because it functionally separated business and creative,” Landgraf observes. “Decoupling those two things sort of pitted those disciplines a little bit against each other more than creating a cooperative environment. The reconstitution of Disney Entertainment brought us all back together again.” Amid all of the shuffling, the elevation of Dana Walden in 2022 to be the top executive running all TV might have been a catalyst for a leader of Landgraf’s stature to seek a job somewhere else. He’s been courted by many companies many times — and by his own account he’s never engaged because he’s never had a more tempting offer. He routinely expresses his gratitude for Iger’s leadership as well as for Walden and Peter Rice, the Fox veteran who held the top TV job immediately after the Disney deal but was pushed out in 2022 by Chapek. “If Dana, Peter and I hadn’t come over together, I don’t think we would have made it through all that. Obviously, at a certain point, Peter didn’t make it through. I don’t think I’d still be here without Dana,” Landgraf says. “None of this would exist without Bob [Iger]. I don’t think I’d be here without Bob – term one and term two.” Walden notes that she and Landgraf first worked closely together even before he joined FX, during the 1999-2004 period when Landgraf ran Danny DeVito’s Jersey Television banner. Jersey Television had a studio production pact with 20th Century Fox Television as Walden was climbing the ranks at that studio. “There’s an enormous amount of trust between the two of us. We’ve been there for each other for a very long time,” Walden says. “From the moment I got this job, John said, ‘I’m thrilled.’ These jobs can get a little lonely at the top. I think he feels a little less lonely in his role because he has me as a partner.” From Landgraf and Walden on down, the well established working relationships among the core executive team is a big advantage for the company, industry insiders say. Balian considers herself a newbie at the company, and she’s heading into her 13th year as a senior production and programming executive. Grad is at 22 years and counting. Marketing chief Stephanie Gibbons passed her 20-year milestone earlier this year. Communications chief John Solberg is approaching 25 years. Eric Schrier spent 22 years as a key architect of FX before moving two years ago to a senior role under Walden as president of Disney Television Studios and business operations. Continuity of management breeds strong company culture, and the culture at FX is as strong as the chrome on the motorcycles seen in “Sons of Anarchy.” “There’s just a scrappiness to the place,” says Balian during a sit-down interview with Grad and Landgraf in late October. FX signed on the air in 1994 amid a boom cycle for cable channel launches. Thanks to its humble beginnings as a ragtag cousin of the Fox broadcast network, FX had a steeper climb to becoming a contender in prestige TV contests than HBO after “The Sopranos” hit the creative communities on both coasts like a meteor. “You never counted on being given anything. You always felt you had to work for it, right?” Balian asks Grad and Landgraf. They nod. “I go back to the same analysis I’ve been doing for 22 years,” Grad says, “which is, make really original, cool shit, and the rest will sort itself out.” Iger made a visit to FX’s office on the West L.A. Fox lot days after the Disney-Fox acquisition agreement was reached in December 2017. He was already a fan of the work the company did, but he didn’t know Landgraf or anyone else there, with the exception of Grad. (Grad’s late father, MTM Television and 20th Century Fox executive Peter Grad, had been Iger’s business associate in the 1980s and ’90s.) “I walked in and said, ‘Tell me about yourselves,’” Iger recalls. “To a person, they understood the brand’s mission and what they stood for.” Iger assured the nervous staffers that he had no intention of disrupting the FX ecosystem or imposing an overly Disney-fied work environment on them. Iger has learned the importance of preserving an acquired company’s unique culture and characteristics the hard way — by enduring difficult post-merger transitions. “The culture of a company is extremely valuable and part of the value proposition in a deal,” Iger says. “You don’t create a Pixar unless you have a great culture, unless you have people who don’t stop trying to make something the best it can be. People who don’t accept mediocrity.” FX’s strength flies in the face of trends that are reshaping the industry. Americans are bailing out of linear cable TV subscriptions in favor of less expensive streamers, a steady decline that spells doom for even the most established cable channels. FX still has tentpole franchises that draw viewers to the linear channel. That’s allowed it to experiment with slightly different programming strategies for the cable channel and the FX branded show portfolio that’s showcased on Hulu in the U.S. and Disney+ in major territories outside the U.S. Walden points to the FX drama “Snowfall” as an example. During the show’s six-season run, the average age of viewers who tuned in was in the 60s. On Hulu, the average age was in the mid-30s. That’s clear evidence that making the show available on different platforms means that it reaches different viewers. Almost all of FX’s series eventually wind up airing on both linear and streaming. “We view it more as a windowing strategy versus an either/or,” Walden says. FX leaders also still eagerly embrace the concept of producing a pilot episode before making a series greenlight decision. That seems antiquated by comparison to the number of outlets that make the yea-or-nay call after reading a few sample scripts. (HBO is a notable exception.) Grad cites the FX comedy series “Atlanta” as an example of how starting out with only a pilot helped a series become what it was meant to be. As Donald Glover was crafting the show a decade ago, the star insisted that its first installment be directed by Hiro Murai, his collaborator on music videos released by Glover’s hip-hop alter ego, Childish Gambino. It was easier for FX execs to gamble on an untested TV director when the network was only paying for a pilot than to commit full-throttle to an eight- or 10-episode TV series. Pilots used to be the norm for all TV networks and studios, but that has also changed amid the rise of streaming. “If we weren’t making pilots, I don’t know if we’d make that decision on Hiro, who turned out to be one of the most talented narrative directors in the entire industry,” Grad observes. “Cutting our risk into small [financial] milestones along the way definitely allows us to be much ballsier with our choices.” Like other traditional outlets, FX has struggled to adapt to new norms for TV series production and the resulting impact on how creative talent is compensated. FX has some flexibility in dealmaking when it also serves as the studio, as it did on “Shōgun.” But the larger industry shift toward subscription business models and away from after-market sales of movies and TV shows has changed the stakes for creatives. It’s a factor behind the anger that fueled last year’s writers and actors strikes. And it’s by no means settled, the FX trio acknowledge. “Psychologically, I like to live in a world where there’s home runs,” Grad says. “I think people like to know that even if the odds are stacked against them, there’s always the chance they could make life-changing money. And the fact that’s kind of off the table now is less our problem than it is a collective industry problem.” Most of all, FX leaders pride themselves on working hand in hand with writers, producers and other creatives to find the essence of what the artist is trying to say with their work. FX doesn’t have the budget to write big checks to land starry packages. What it can offer creatives is a white-glove approach to honing the material, in an environment where the platform is handling 15 to 20 shows a year, not 150 to 200. It’s a strong selling point for a certain breed of writer, director, producer and star. “We’re like relentless editors, but we’re not relentless editors who are trying to impose our own taste or our own aesthetic on something. We’re relentless editors who say, ‘OK, let us descend into the world that you’re in. Let us help you do the thing you want to do,” Landgraf explains. “We think about what are the best possible questions we can pose to you to challenge you, to make sure that you have thought [the story] through. We want to help artists make the very, very best version of the show that they can possibly make.” Kondo, creator and executive producer of “Shōgun,” confirms that a note-taking session at FX is like none other, thanks to the skills leadership trio as well as key executives such as exec VP Kate Lambert and VP Lindsay Donohue. But it starts at the top. “It’s amazing how deeply [Landgraf] listens to you and the degree of thought that goes into everything he says. He brings in philosophy, history, literature, the Bible – you name it, he brings it all to the table,” Kondo says. “I come to every meeting with my notebook cleared. I know I’m going to get something incredibly valuable, not only to what we’re working on but, like, for my life in general and how I think about my writing.” John Landgraf knows something about human behavior. He was an anthropology major at Pitzer College. He’s been a television programming executive for most of his adult life. He’s studied the intersection of social movements and artistic and pop-culture trends. He’s fascinated by how communities are formed and how they splinter at a time when communication tools (aka the new iPhone in your pocket) are advancing at lightning speed. One indisputable result of the quickening pace of innovation is the increasing amount of global economic activity that revolves around engaging consumers in some form of media — whether a TV show or a TikTok feed or a live virtual concert staged within a Fortnite video game. Will the soft power of media eventually become the most valuable commodity of all? The global economy seems to think so. And that also really worries Landgraf, as the largest of what he calls the “trillion-dollar companies” move deeper into the business he knows best. “There’s something really strange in an economy where there are 500 companies in the S&P and seven of them account for 70% of the growth in the U.S. economy. That’s different,” he says, referring to the group of companies dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” by Wall Street: Apple, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla. “I’m not making any value judgment on what they do or what they don’t do. But I can tell you, they’re not long-form storytelling companies,” he says. “And long-form storytelling has been very deeply at the center of American culture and American enterprise and American soft power and a whole lot of other things. And demoting it in the scheme of the communications hierarchy can have profound effects that really worry me.” The Walt Disney Co. is no mom-and-pop operation; as of Nov. 21, its market cap stood at $209 billion. But in the scheme of companies with trillion-dollar balance sheets, Disney could become a takeover target down the road. For now, however, Landgraf is glad that FX found a place in the Magic Kingdom. “Disney made a really bold choice to pivot a century-old company into streaming and the direct-to-consumer business,” he says. “And they decided that they wanted to be as excellent in general entertainment as they are in family entertainment and sports.” FX will take another swing at a big-budget event series with the reimagining of “Alien” with “Fargo” showrunner Noah Hawley. It’s slated to debut in the summer. So the pressure to deliver on a global scale begins anew. Also on the to-do list for next year is moving into new offices on the Disney studio lot in Burbank. That will be the symbolic final step in the Disney merger integration for FX’s nearly 300 staffers, who have continued to work out of leased offices on the Fox lot. There are myriad other challenges ahead. Some of them are utterly unpredictable, like the forward march of AI and technological developments that might further upend the pay-TV ecosystem. Others are as old as the Hollywood Hills. “I’ll give you an analogy,” Landgraf says. “Somebody hands you a giant bucket full of acorns, and only one of them is going to be an oak tree. And they say, ‘Pick the acorn out of this bucket that’s going to be an oak tree.’” He smiles. “You do have the ability to plant it, fertilize it, water it. But some acorns just are not going to grow into oak trees, no matter what you do with them, so you’ve got to pick the ones that have the ability to do that.” Balian and Grad take in the oak-tree analogy as Landgraf argues that the real “magic” of the entertainment business is found in the hunt for the right acorn to nurture. That heady assertion hangs in the air for a few seconds, and then each executive heads back to their office to plant some more trees. The Business of Entertainment

Are you interested in owning – maybe some Bitcoin or Ethereum or some other crypto coins? How should ordinary investors interested in the cryptocurrency space get exposure to that asset? I’m Barry Ritholtz, and on today’s edition of At the Money, we’re going to discuss how retail investors can responsibly invest in crypto. To help us unpack all of this and what it means for your portfolio, let’s bring in Matt Hogan. He is the chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, the firm manages over 10 billion in client assets in crypto. Let’s start with just the basics, Matt. For the longest time, it’s been challenging and difficult to own crypto. There were wallets and coins and crazy passwords, lots of hacks and other problems. Tell us about what’s going on in the world of actually owning cryptocurrencies. Matt Hougan: It’s great to be here, Barry. It’s getting a lot easier to own crypto, you know, in the past, this was a new disruptive market. It was challenging. You had to write down your secret password and not lose it. There are all these terrible stories about people losing passwords that are now, you know, would have gotten them a hundred million dollars or whatever. But this is just like any other technology you and I remember when the internet. was hard to use. I remember looking up websites in a book, which I now sounds absolutely insane, but technology has advanced. It’s now easy to get high quality access and secure access to crypto if you use the right tools. Barry Ritholtz: Really interesting. So it sounds like the wild west of crypto has been tamed a little bit. There certainly has been a push by well-known financial institutions into the space. You can own crypto coins and ETFs. You can own them in closed-end funds. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of the various ways and methodologies of owning this? Matt Hougan: I have to say I’m a huge fan of the ETFs. Uh, you know, obviously, we offer them, so I’m talking my book, but broadly speaking, the ETFs came out in January of this year, and they let you own crypto at such low cost and with such institutional quality, custody, and trading. Retail investors today can get the same sort of setup that the largest institutions in the world were getting in crypto a year or two ago. So, these ETFs make it easy to buy exposure to Bitcoin in a brokerage account and know that the crypto or the Bitcoin is being held by an institutional regulated custodian with insurance in place with all the bells and whistles, but they don’t have to worry about it. Five years ago, you had to worry about that personally. The ETFs have sort of taken that complexity away and made it cheap and safe to own. Barry Ritholtz: And you’re really a fascinating person to talk to about this because you come from the ETF side of the industry. You spent how many years, 20 years working on ETFs? Tell us a little bit about your background and what led you into the crypto side to come up with ways to put coins in ETFs. Matt Hougan: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. 20 years in the ETF industry, the CEO of ETF.com. There are actually so many parallels between ETFs and crypto. I know ETFs today are the apple pie of investing. They’re Everyone’s favorite tool. But 20 years ago, they were considered risky and disruptive and hard to access. The Financial Times called them weapons of mass destruction. There were congressional hearings, Barry, about ETFs destroying the American dream, if you can believe it. But ETFs had this core advantage, which were they were lower cost, they were more tax efficient, they were easier to use. And over time, the world woke up to the reality. The same thing’s happening in crypto. You can see it before your eyes. A few years ago, Larry Fink called Bitcoin an index of money laundering. Today, he’s talking about it transforming the world of currency and he holds more Bitcoin than almost anyone else. So it’s going in that direction, and absolutely you’re seeing these two worlds come together, where this new financial innovation of crypto is now being packaged in this beautiful package of an ETF and making it easy for every investor to access. It’s a beautiful thing. Barry Ritholtz: And I want to talk a little bit about the, the safety aspect and the institutionalization. None of the coins are regulated. It very much has been the Wild-West. You’re not a crypto exchange. You’re a fund manager. You’re a financial manager. Who is the regulatory authority that supervises bitwise? Matt Hougan: Yeah. All of them. We have all the letters, all the letters, Barry. Um, you know, we’re regulated by the sec because even though the crypto assets aren’t the funds that we offer, the ETFs that we offer. We are regulated and passed through the SEC. Of course, also the CFTC for products that hold futures contracts; FINRA which is another regulator has oversight over broker-dealers. And so our distribution team sits under that. All our materials are reviewed by FINRA, the NFA. It’s an alphabet soup of regulators, but it’s a good thing for investors because one thing that is true about crypto is in the early wild, wild, west days, when you had offshore exchanges doing shady things, people lost money. A great thing that has happened is that has moved. into these regulated formats like ETFs. So you do have some protections from the SEC, the CFTC, FINRA, the NFA and others. And of course, Bitwise sits within those protections as an RIA. Barry Ritholtz: That’s really interesting. So, so you’re a regulated entity, where do the ETFs and various funds get custodied? How are they held? Who does the administrative reporting? I think of these as complex questions for a coin, but really they’re kind of run of the mill questions for an SEC regulated Entity like Bitwise Matt Hougan: It looks exactly like or very similar to any other etf manager So the crypto assets are held in a regulated qualified custodian in the case of our bitcoin ETF It’s coinbase custody, which is the largest crypto custodian in the world. The funds are audited by big four auditors in our case it’s KPMG They’re administered by firms like Bank of New York. If you looked at the sort of stack of participants, it would look just like, you know, a traditional equity ATM. And that’s what it should do, right? These are trusted rails that have been proven over years, and we’ve just applied them to crypto to give similar protections to crypto investors. Barry Ritholtz: So the one thing that I find kind of amusing and ironic. Is the whole DeFi nonsense, the decentralized finance turns out to have been a narrative that kind of faded away because crypto for all the talk about “outside of the financial system” has been dragged kicking and screaming right into the heart of the financial system. Matt Hougan: I admit that there is an irony there, but I actually think It’s more of a continuum. Sort of the core idea of DeFi is that the existing financial system is too slow, too intermediated, too costly. And all of that is true. DeFi offers the potential to improve that, But of course the two systems have to come together. And you’re seeing it. So you’re seeing, from the crypto side, the launch of ETFs. Moving into the traditional financial system. But you also have firms like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton issuing money market funds on public blockchains like Ethereum. So you are seeing this coming together. I wouldn’t write off DeFi 1.0, Barry. I think there’ll be a DeFi 2.0 that is much more significant. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk about individuals who want to own crypto. What sort of strategies do they deploy? Is it Bitcoin or bust, or should they own Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a bunch of other coins? Give us some investment strategies. Matt Hougan: Without telling anyone exactly what to do, I’m an index investor at heart, right? This is a disruptive early market. My family owned a Betamax, I remember using a BlackBerry, it’s hard to know exactly how this market will turn out in the future. So. I think taking a diversified approach to this market is probably a sensible approach for many investors. There’s certainly people who are Bitcoin only, who only care about the monetary aspects of crypto, but in any disruptive technology, my history, you know, having grown up through the tech bubble, you tells me that a diversified approach may be a good idea for many investors. Barry Ritholtz: Makes a lot of sense. Whenever I talk about stocks to an investor, I always warn them, “Hey, listen, you know, you get a 10 to 20% pullback two out of every three years, and a 20% comes along just about every third year. With crypto. I love the expression crypto winter. And we’ve had a number of them when for a year or two crypto currencies can be down, you know, 50 percent or worse. We’ve probably had three of them over the past, you know, 10 or so years. So how should investors prepare themselves for what seems to be an inevitable drawdown? Matt Hougan: It’s a really important question. People ask me all the time what the biggest risk in crypto. Is it regulatory? Is it technical? Is it quantum computing? It’s none of those things. The biggest risk is behavioral risk by investors who either chase prices when they go up, or sell when prices go down, this is an asset that has huge volatility. You’re going to get 30, 40, 50% drawdowns in the future. I feel confident about that. As you mentioned, we’ve seen those in the past and there’s no reason to expect that will change. For investors, what that means is two things. One, you need a long-term discipline. If you’re buying Bitcoin for the next week, I have no idea where it’s going. I’m optimistic over the next handful of years. And the second, is you need to size your portfolio appropriately. Don’t put in so much that if it pulls back 50%, you’re going to panic and sell because that is the worst-case scenario. You’re better just sitting on the sidelines, put in a small amount if you’re going to invest so you can handle that up and down and it won’t overly impact what you’re doing. Barry Ritholtz: So you mentioned price – Bitcoin goes way up. It goes way down – is there a way of looking at these from a fundamental perspective? How do we value coins other than whatever their last trade was? Matt Hougan: Unfortunately a little bit complex. Bitcoin’s valuation technique is different from other crypto assets like Ethereum. When you think about Bitcoin, what I think Bitcoin is trying to become is a digital version of gold; a way to store money outside of central banks in a digital format. And we have digital versions of everything. We have digital versions of newspapers. We have digital versions of ads. I think the world and younger generations want a digital version of gold. The reason I raised that is you can look at Bitcoin today. It’s a little under $2 trillion. You can look at gold. It’s a little under 20 trillion. Do you think it’ll get half that market? Well, then you think Bitcoin will 5x from here. Do you think it’ll get, that full market you’re more optimistic, or do you think it’ll be less successful? That’s actually the best way to value Bitcoin. These other crypto assets like Ethereum are different. They actually have cashflow-like characteristics. So they behave a little bit more like stocks. They’re more sort of fundamentally valued then Bitcoin, which is this monetary asset. So you have to think of the two different sets of assets a little differently. Barry Ritholtz: So you and I are both index guys. That’s, that’s our background. If I’m an investor and I want to put 2 or 3% of my portfolio into coins, what do I do? Do I tell us about some of the options that you guys have? Should I be go 2X-levered Bitcoin or am I better off with, Hey, here are the five biggest coins or 10 biggest coins and own them all. Matt Hougan: I wouldn’t go 2X-levered Bitcoin. Uh, you know, Bitcoin is volatile enough. Um, I think investors can make a choice within the ETF space. The only coins that we have access to are Bitcoin and Ethereum. And the good news is those are the two largest assets. They’re the leaders in their spaces. So you can do worse than go two parts Bitcoin and one part ETH. And have at least broad-based exposure. If you want to be more diversified and take an index-based approach, you know, we have bitwise have the largest crypto index fund it’s available in a wrapper, but that wrapper is more like a closed-end fund. So it can trade at premiums. And discounts, and you have to be aware that you have that extra layer of volatility. Either approach can make sense for the right investor, as long as you understand what you’re getting into. Barry Ritholtz: So I want to not get too lost in the weeds on the technical issues, but I keep hearing about the having that’s coming up and what does that mean? What should lay people understand about this? Matt Hougan:. If you think about Bitcoin, when it was created way back in 2008-09, there were no Bitcoin in existence. And we all know, or many of us know that eventually there’ll be 21 million Bitcoin. The way we get from zero to 21 million is every day, a little bit more Bitcoin is issued. What the halving refers to, Barry, is that every four years. The amount of Bitcoin that’s issued falls in half. And the last halving was earlier this year, right? It dropped in half. What that means is there’s less new supply coming into the market. In the end, Bitcoin’s price is set by supply and demand. You have all these people buying Bitcoin through the ETF and other means. And then you have supply – and supply is either this newly developed Bitcoin or existing people selling it. So what the halving does is it reduces the amount of supply in the market. If I told you that the amount of oil coming out of the ground would fall in half tomorrow, you might be bullish on oil. The same sort of narrative is true in Bitcoin. The amount of Bitcoin coming out of the ground, if you will, falls in half every four years, and we’re just sort of starting to feel the impact of the most recent halving now. Barry Ritholtz: All of these challenges, whether it’s the limited amount of supply, that halving should be fairly well known by investors. None of these are surprise. It’s not like an earning surprise. Hey, everybody who’s a Bitcoin investor understands these. So the question becomes what are going to be the future drivers of Bitcoin return? Should we be thinking about Bitcoin like a commodity, like a currency? You know, you mentioned, just under $2 trillion in market cap for Bitcoin that puts it somewhere between Meta and Alphabet, Facebook and Google – do we think about this like a large tech company? How should we contextualize the coins themselves? Matt Hougan: I think of Bitcoin specifically as a commodity. It’s a commodity with scarce supply and its price is set by supply and demand. One of the reasons I’m so optimistic about Bitcoin right now is we have major new sources of demand. Institutional investors are just now buying Bitcoin. There’s talk of the U. S. government acquiring one million Bitcoin. Corporations are acquiring Bitcoin. None of that was true in a major way a year ago or two years ago. And so you have all this new demand. But unlike other commodities, Unlike gold, unlike oil, unlike copper, you can have all the demand in the world. You don’t get any more supply. The supply is literally fixed. It’s pre-programmed. So when you think about: Are you optimistic or pessimistic on Bitcoin? I like to think about that supply/demand dynamic. And from what I see, there’s a lot more demand coming online and limited new supply coming online. That makes me optimistic. It’s not a guarantee. We can see some of those things not materialize. We can see investors scared off, but I like the long term framing of it from that simple supply demand perspective. Barry Ritholtz: Investors who are crypto-curious can buy various coins today much more easily than you used to be able to. If you wanted to own any sort of coin, you could buy it in a or even easier in an ETF. Be very aware that you have to position size appropriately. Hey, if you want to own a percent or three in your portfolio (of your liquid net worth) the responsible way to do this is not through a leveraged product, not anything that’s reflective of the old Wild West ethos of crypto, but a traditional ETF. You have a small position as you would for any particular company and be aware of your own behavior when it comes to managing yourself around the volatility of Bitcoin. I’m Barry Ritholtz.

Title: The Next Hot Cybersecurity Skill for Your Resume? Empathy
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/security/27087/the-next-hot-cybersecurity-skill-for-your-resume-empathy
Time Published: 2024-11-26T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
As layoffs ravaged the tech industry throughout 2024, two sectors kept hiring: AI and cybersecurity. Generative AI isn't a surprise; it's the hot new thing, after all. Cybersecurity, on the other hand, contains many subcategories that require either technical know-how or a historical understanding of computing and crime. I recently spoke with someone who's done a lot of cybersecurity hiring in recent years, Maarten Van Horenbeeck, the chief security officer at Adobe. He told me that creating empathy through skill diversity is his goal when hiring for Adobe's cybersecurity teams. We also talked about how his teams find and train new hires from not-so-technical backgrounds to provide a much-needed balance between the business and technical sides of the company. Cybersecurity subcategories such as cloud security, digital forensics, identity management, incident response, and network security may sound similar, but they all require different kinds of expertise. In recent years, experts have told me that it's hard to hire a person with 10 years of experience in the nebulous field that is cybersecurity. It's the reason why there's an oft-discussed cybersecurity talent gap that's leaving key roles unfilled at major companies. Van Horenbeeck said that many people want to get into cybersecurity, but they usually don’t get many chances to develop expertise while working their day jobs in unrelated fields like developers or corporate communications. He suggested that one way managers can find new hires is to consider applicants with diverse skill sets who can apply their past experiences to current security issues. Van Horenbeeck used his career path as an example. When he began working as a security consultant in the early 2000s, he dabbled in a bit of everything. From cryptography to forensics to incident response and even penetration testing, it all gave him a wide scope of the cybercrime landscape and how it fits into a wider corporate ecosystem. Today’s highly technical, hyperspecialized cybersecurity community lends itself to experts focusing on just one niche, which makes it harder to hire people with a broad understanding of a company’s security needs. “That's an area where I think companies like us have a responsibility to identify candidates that have potential even if they don't have that very broad expertise in the security domain," he said. “Give them opportunities to grow to find the area that they really feel best about and allow them to grow in that specific domain.” Building teams with people who only have security backgrounds has its drawbacks. “They don't always understand how a software developer works from beginning to end, and that lack of empathy can make things harder,” said Van Horenbeeck. Instead, his company hires developers or people with similar skills who are interested in cybersecurity. They then train them for a specific security niche. This practice is designed to create teams with empathy at the core of their cybersecurity strategies. Adobe’s CyberPeace Builders program also seeks to develop empathetic cybersecurity teams by working with nonprofit organizations. The program provides volunteer security support for nonprofits in need. “For me, empathy is the number one skill that we need in individuals that enter the field,” said Van Horenbeeck. “By having our engineers work with organizations that are so different from technology companies, I think they really get to learn about how their advice is taken in real life.” People who have worked in other careers or at other jobs will bring new perspectives to the team, helping the group solve problems that go beyond IT or software development. It’s wise in any career to have empathy and patience for people who do not have your expertise or skillset. Not every organization has Adobe’s resources. Still, if you manage a cybersecurity team, it may be possible to create your own experts with a commitment to in-house education. It starts with facilitating company-wide conversations about cybersecurity. “As a CSO, I am most successful when there are many different conversations ongoing in the company related to security,” said Van Hoorenbeck. At Adobe, the cybersecurity team offers opportunities for employees to collaborate with people from other teams through presentations, brown bag information sessions, and soliciting performance feedback from other employee groups. If your company is only looking for new employees on job boards or at job fairs, you’re missing out. Van Horenbeeck said it’s especially important to identify talented entry-level employees who are interested in cybersecurity. That means going to where those people are talking: Cyber conferences, mailing lists, or online communities like BlackGirlsHack. Another option is sponsoring internships with higher education institutions. “We look with these universities for people that may be a really good fit to join Adobe as an intern and then ideally migrate into full-time roles within the company," explained Van Horenbeeck. Adobe partnered with Bowie State University for an internship program in 2023, and other major tech companies, such as Amazon and Microsoft, have similar partnerships with schools around the United States. The best way to find talented cybersecurity employees or to become a security professional is to relax your expertise expectations and approach the career with empathy at the forefront. “Don't purely focus on cyber security,” Van Horenbeeck advised. “I would say look at technology as a wide field, and look at security as a specialization in it. That creates opportunities for you to move into those types of roles.” I review privacy tools like hardware security keys, password managers, private messaging apps and ad-blocking software. I also report on online scams and offer advice to families and individuals about staying safe on the internet. Before joining PCMag, I wrote about tech and video games for CNN, Fanbyte, Mashable, The New York Times, and TechRadar. I also worked at CNN International, where I did field producing and reporting on sports that are popular with worldwide audiences. PCMag is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

Title: Wall Street’s Uber Bull Tom Lee Makes Next Bold Bet in ETF Era

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) — Wall Street prognosticators tend to huddle around the consensus, afraid to stand out for fear of being wrong. Then there’s Tom Lee. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge The chief investment officer at Fundstrat Capital has made his name with bold calls (the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at 15,000; Bitcoin (BTC-USD) to $10 million). His unabashedly bullish takes, for which he makes no apologies, have drawn legions of online followers in this anything-goes era of market speculation — fueled by do-it-yourself retail investors. Now, the former JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist is looking to cash in on his renown with a new exchange-traded fund, the Granny Shots US Large Cap ETF (ticker GRNY), which launched earlier this month and has already raked in more than $400 million. It’s the first of what he hopes will be many to follow. The fund’s name, like the list of equity recommendations Lee has provided clients since 2019, is derived from an unconventional basketball free-throw style he likens to his systematic, theme-based stock-picking process. It may not look the coolest, Lee says, but it has the highest chance of success. “Our clients and their loyalty and the fact that we’re still growing really rapidly as a research firm is not just because we’re bulls,” Lee said in an interview, adding the firm has a dedicated institutional following as well. “It’s because we’ve given them many reasons to understand why markets should do what they’re doing.” The ETF is off to a strong start. GRNY is up 2.2% since its early November launch, compared to a 0.2% advance for the S&P 500 over the same span. Its $412 million of inflows puts it in the top 10% of fund debuts this year based on speed of asset accumulation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Still, GRNY is launching amid a difficult run for stock pickers. Roughly two-thirds of large cap managers have underperformed the S&P 500 this year through the end of October, data from Strategas Research show. In fact, more than half of active managers have trailed the benchmark in 14 of the last 15 years. Thematic ETFs have also fallen out of favor recently, with outflows in nine out of 10 months this year through October, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. For more, subscribe to the ETF IQ weekly newsletter That won’t deter Lee. GRNY is based on four longer-term themes, including easing financial conditions and global labor suppliers, and three shorter-term ones like seasonality and style tilt. Stocks that aligned with two or more of the themes are included in the fund. Meta Platforms Inc. falls into five themes, for example, while Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Garmin Ltd. fit into four. “It’s not a black box process,” said Lee, who added that he and his team have received positive feedback for their transparency. “Granny Shots is giving people a really good understanding of why they’re owning this.” Top holdings include police and military equipment producer Axon Enterprise Inc., Tesla Inc. and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. The fund, which consists of some 35 stocks, will be rebalanced quarterly. The themes, too, are dynamic. Being perennially bullish doesn’t always pay off, of course. Both 2018 and 2022 were difficult years for risk assets and, in turn, Lee’s optimistic outlook. Yet last year his S&P 500 forecast was the most accurate among more than 20 Wall Street strategists tracked by Bloomberg as the gauge advanced 24%. This year is likely to be a similar story as the benchmark’s 26% advance has exceeded even the most bullish estimates. He recently told Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast that the S&P 500 could hit 15,000 by 2030. When it comes to Bitcoin, he’s been predicting the digital token would hit $100,000 since at least 2018. In February, he forecast the virtual currency would reach $150,000 by year-end, mainly because of a supply-demand imbalance due to a planned reduction in the rewards miners receive, and incoming president Donald Trump’s pledge to set up a national Bitcoin stockpile. Lee, who co-manages the fund with Ken Xuan, is the latest in a growing list of prominent economists and investors to launch ETFs, joining the likes of Nouriel Roubini, Research Affiliates’ Rob Arnott and others. Still, it takes more than just a recognizable name to launch a successful fund, he said. “I don’t think just because someone has a name that suddenly they can put out an ETF and it attracts assets,” Lee said. Ultimately, the plan is for GRNY to be the first of numerous ETFs based on Lee’s investment philosophy. “We’re already planning a full phase of what follows this one,” he said. —With assistance from Lu Wang.

Title: How the Trump tariffs on Taiwan chips could hurt the AI trade — and the likes of Nvidia

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/26/2024 4:05:54 AM PST by RoosterRedux President-elect Donald Trump made raising tariffs on imported goods a tenet of his reelection campaign. And while that could raise prices on everything from jeans to children’s toys for everyday Americans, Trump has also floated the idea of another tariff that could impact Wall Street’s current favorite trade: AI. During an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast ahead of the election, Trump lambasted the idea of the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation Biden signed in 2022 designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. He called it “so bad.” Instead of using legislation and billions in subsidies to bring chip-building facilities to the US, Trump said tariffs would have the same effect. In Trump’s estimation, putting tariffs on semiconductors from Taiwan would force chip builders, like TSMC, to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay the added tax. But there’s no guarantee chip builders wouldn’t simply move the added cost down the line to their customers and forego spending cash on expensive US facilities. Such a move could also end up cutting into profit margins for companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which rely on chips built in Taiwan, unless they similarly pass those costs down to their own customers. And that could have ripple effects across the tech industry. “If the argument is that this is the way to force it to move here, TSMC is already moving here,” explained William Reinsch, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They're already building a fab plant in Arizona. That's all already underway and the tariffs aren't going to make that move any faster. If anything, they might complicate the effort.” (Excerpt) Read more at finance.yahoo.com ...

Providing defense for Taiwan costs money. If the US military wasn’t funded, the PRC flag would be flying over where the silicon foundries are. Hitting the Russian bear in Ukraine to deter the PRC from invading Taiwan is expensive. Many of the chips never make it to the USA, they go to the EU, Japan, elsewhere in Taiwan, Canada, etc. 7 posted on 11/26/2024 4:30:31 AM PST by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: RoosterRedux Joe Biden launched a program to build chips in the USA years ago and spent billions of US taxpayer money. We wouldn’t want to undermine his legacy. Having chip companies repay in tariffs the money Joe spent to build chip plants seems fair. 8 posted on 11/26/2024 4:35:04 AM PST by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: dennisw Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is in the process of building three advanced semiconductor fabrication plants in Arizona, with the first expected to come online in 2025. I believe that if Trump takes office again, he will likely encourage TSMC to expedite the construction of additional facilities, although this is complicated by the current shortage of a highly trained labor force in the U.S. Additionally, I anticipate that Trump will collaborate with Nvidia and other chip manufacturers to facilitate a smooth transition to U.S.-based production. Regarding the potential for a Chinese attack on Taiwan, such an event would severely cripple or even destroy TSMC’s operations. This would have a cascading effect on China's economy, which is heavily reliant on chips sourced from TSMC. Consequently, it would significantly hinder China's ambitions to develop its own semiconductor industry. 9 posted on 11/26/2024 4:36:27 AM PST by RoosterRedux (Emerson (paraphrased): "If you strike at the king, don't fail."

I believe that if Trump takes office again, he will likely encourage TSMC to expedite the construction of additional facilities, although this is complicated by the current shortage of a highly trained labor force in the U.S. Additionally, I anticipate that Trump will collaborate with Nvidia and other chip manufacturers to facilitate a smooth transition to U.S.-based production. Regarding the potential for a Chinese attack on Taiwan, such an event would severely cripple or even destroy TSMC’s operations. This would have a cascading effect on China's economy, which is heavily reliant on chips sourced from TSMC. Consequently, it would significantly hinder China's ambitions to develop its own semiconductor industry. 9 posted on 11/26/2024 4:36:27 AM PST by RoosterRedux (Emerson (paraphrased): "If you strike at the king, don't fail."

In Trump’s estimation, putting tariffs on semiconductors from Taiwan would force chip builders, like TSMC, to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay the added tax. But there’s no guarantee chip builders wouldn’t simply move the added cost down the line to their customers and forego spending cash on expensive US facilities. Such a move could also end up cutting into profit margins for companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which rely on chips built in Taiwan, unless they similarly pass those costs down to their own customers. And that could have ripple effects across the tech industry. “If the argument is that this is the way to force it to move here, TSMC is already moving here,” explained William Reinsch, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They're already building a fab plant in Arizona.

Title: Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $93,000: Top 3 Reasons
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-crashes-below-93000-top-3-reasons/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T12:00:22Z
Full Content:
The crypto market faced a significant setback today as the Bitcoin price dropped below the $93,000 threshold. After reaching an all-time high of $99,588 on Binance last Friday, the leading cryptocurrency has fallen over 6%, hitting a low of $92,326. In the past 24 hours alone, the Bitcoin price has decreased by 3.6%. Analysts attribute this decline to three main factors: As Bitcoin neared the critical $100,000 resistance level, many long-term holders began taking profits, leading to increased selling pressure. James “Checkmate” Check, former chief on-chain analyst at Glassnode, noted that long-term holders have distributed $60 billion worth of Bitcoin supply in the last 30 days. “Bitcoin Long-Term Holders have distributed $60B worth of supply in the last 30-days. Out of all the LTH supply moved since the FTX bottom, 21% of it has happened in November. This is the heaviest profit taking we have seen so far this cycle,” Check writes via X. He also points out that selling pressure is not coming from “OG’s” but holders who bought at the previous peak of $68,000 have sold 198,000 BTC in November alone. This suggests that investors who endured the last major correction are now capitalizing on the recent price surge as Bitcoin approached uncharted price territory. The futures market has seen substantial liquidations, amplifying the Bitcoin price crash. Data from Coinglass indicates that in the past 24 hours, total liquidations amounted to $577.39 million, with long positions accounting for $468.98 million. Singapore-based QCP Capital commented on the situation: “Bitcoin has slipped below $93k since our last commentary, with over $430 million in long liquidations.” They observed that this decline coincided with spot ETFs ending their five-day streak of net inflows, recording a $438 million outflow on Monday, while MicroStrategy’s stock dropped another 4.4%. QCP Capital also mentions that “the pullback follows MicroStrategy’s record $5.4 billion BTC purchase last week.” With US holidays approaching and no immediate catalysts to drive prices higher, they noted that Bitcoin’s path to the symbolic $100,000 level has stalled. The firm also notes a shift in market sentiment: “ETH implied volatility has shifted sharply toward puts over calls, reflecting similar sentiment in BTC as the market takes a breather. Growing concerns about downside risks may intensify, particularly with tonight’s FOMC minutes and Wednesday’s PCE data on the horizon.” Despite the downturn, they provide a balanced perspective: “To put things into perspective, this isn’t an excessive pullback. Bitcoin is merely retracing to levels seen early last week. The market had become extremely overbought since the election with excessive leverage, making a pause inevitable.” The Coinbase premium gap, a key indicator of US institutional demand, has vanished. During Bitcoin’s ascent toward $100,000, the premium gap on Coinbase was notably high, reaching +$224 on November 22. This was driven by strong inflows into US Bitcoin ETFs and significant purchases by MicroStrategy, which acquired 55,500 BTC for $5.4 billion over the weekend. However, this scenario shifted dramatically yesterday. On-chain analyst Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) points out today: “MicroStrategy Single-handedly Held Up the Market. The Coinbase Premium Gap, which was driven by Saylor’s buying spree, vanished, and the market started to tank.” Charles Edwards, CEO of Capriole Investment, highlights the immense sell wall around the $100,000 level. He remarked that despite MicroStrategy’s massive $5.5 billion purchase, they “only dented the world’s biggest ask wall by ~25%.” This underscores the significant selling interest at the $100,000 level, which has proven to be a formidable barrier. The diminishing premium on Coinbase also reflects reduced buying pressure from US markets, a factor also evident in the outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs. Yesterday, spot ETF flows were negative by $435.3 million. While BlackRock saw inflows of $267.8 million, other major ETFs experienced significant outflows: Bitwise lost $280.7 million, Grayscale BTC Trust (GBTC) saw $158.2 million in outflows, Fidelity faced redemptions of $134.7 million, and ARK Invest shed $110.9 million. At press time, BTC traded $92,422. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Educating a New Generation of Workers

There is a crisis in technical education. The golden road to a career has always been through a college education. However, this âgolden roadâ has developed deep cracks and is badly in need of maintenance. Postsecondary education is rapidly becoming unaffordable, even at public colleges and universities. Tuition has risen at a rate 50% greater than inflation. But thereâs a deeper issue. Beyond the out-of-control cost, there is evidence that degrees do not map to the skills needed in today’s job market, and thereâs an increasing disconnectâparticularly in computer scienceâbetween the skills employers want and the skills colleges teach. Employers are struggling with a related problem: keeping the people who are already on their staff up-to-date with the skills they need. Itâs common for experts who spend their waking hours working at the cutting edge of the technology industry to feel like theyâre falling behind. The trend has only increased in the era of generative AI. A graduate degree is an option for employees who can afford it, but it doesnât help employers. After spending a year getting a masterâs degree, an employee is unlikely to return to the same employer, let alone the same job. Join the O'Reilly online learning platform. Get a free trial today and find answers on the fly, or master something new and useful. Why, and more important how, are colleges and universities failing? And what can companies that need to hire junior staff and upskill their current staff do about it? Colleges and universities are rarely agile. They donât respond to changes quickly, and that leaves them particularly vulnerable when providing training for industries where change is rapid. The traditional CS major may be where colleges and universities are at their weakest. The pace of change is very rapid, particularly when compared to the career of tenured faculty, and the resistance to change can be especially strong when change is rapid. CS departments have adapted well to AI, partly because AI originated in academia. But many jobs require skills that frequently arenât taught in traditional CS departments, such as cloud development, Kubernetes, and microservices. Why arenât these institutions able to adapt to changes in technology? Professors spend much of their time doing researchâwell, in reality, they spend most of their time serving on committees. Thereâs little time left over to find out what industry is doing, let alone develop courses to teach it. Staying current in the tech industry is a bit like being a professional athlete: You have to train daily to maintain your physical conditioning. Entirely new paradigms rise quickly: cloud computing, data engineering, machine learning engineering, mobile development, and large language models. To further complicate things, topics like cloud computing, software operations, and even AI donât fit nicely within a university IT department. They require going outside to commercial cloud vendors, which requires expense accounts and budget commitments that arenât covered by research grants. No university has the computing resources comparable to Google, or even to a well-funded startup. Nor do they have experience building and operating highly distributed systems. Topics like microservices and cloud native computing present an additional problem: salary commitments. Can an administrator justify the salary of a senior faculty member who specializes in a topic that might be forgotten five or ten years in the future, even if thatâs what industry wants right now? Can the administration commit to paying a tenured faculty salary for 30 or so years if that professorâs specialty may be irrelevant long before they retire? Itâs less risky to hire adjunct professors with industry experience to fill teaching roles that have a vocational focus: mobile development, data engineering, and cloud computing. Using adjuncts to teach the skills that industry wants creates its own problem: an underclass within the university teaching staff. Itâs no wonder that I have heard professors say âCloud computing is a fad and not worth teaching.â Itâs no wonder that many faculty members see these topics as âvocational educationâ while theyâre trying to teach long-term verities: these âvocationalâ topics fulfill the needs of industry rather than the research community and are taught by faculty with short-term contracts who come and go each year. Itâs understandable that professors are reluctant to teach a subject that is based almost entirely on proprietary technology that can change with minimal notice. However, if thatâs the kind of expertise companies want, students who need that training will find it elsewhereâand if universities canât provide the training students need, they will lurch toward irrelevance. In a recent Wall Street Journal article, âWhy Americans Have Lost Faith in the Value of College,â Douglas Belkin highlights another issue: critical thinking. As Belkin explains, The misalignment between universities and the labor market is compounded by the failure of many schools to teach students to think critically. Professors compete for tenure on the basis of the quality of their research and publishing track record. Teaching is mostly an afterthought. Professors who earn tenure negotiate lighter teaching loads. To fill the gap, schools hire less expensive adjuncts with little job security. These precariously employed adjuncts depend on strong student performance reviews for job security, a system that incentivizes them to make few demands in exchange for high ratings. Any metric can be gamed (often called Goodhartâs law)âand grades are no exception, gamed both by faculty who need good ratings from students and by students who want good grades from faculty. Grades are part of the critical thinking problem, as is a dismissal of writing, reading, and non-STEM skills. Itâs not as if critical thinking isnât taught in universities. The humanities are nothing without critical thinking, whether or not theyâre taught by overwhelmed and underpaid adjunctsâbut humanities departments are the ones most threatened by budget cuts and, at some schools, outright elimination. Vocational skills are a necessity, whether or not CS departments want to teach them. Assessment is a necessity, and itâs something corporations take very seriously, at least for in-house training programs. But making vocational skills and assessment priorities risks letting grades become a motivating factor, and that is counterproductive. Is anything more conformist than aspiring to do what your teacher says to get an A? Or to build your academic career around getting a job at a prestigious, high-profile company? Students need to learn how to make mistakes. They need to learn how to push their ideas as far as they can and then a little farther. In my classes I encourage students to fail early and often. A failure is a desired outcome: It means they tried something hard and unique or that they learned a big lesson. Teaching students to consider problems from many perspectives, including those that are uncomfortable, is a necessity. Too many students graduate thinking that science is a set of facts rather than understanding that itâs a process of skeptical inquiry driven by experiment. Too many students think that engineering is about getting the answer in the back of the book, not about making the trade-offs that are necessary in the real world. And too many companies fail because they canât question their own assumptions. This is all critical thinkingâand anything less shortchanges both students and the companies that eventually hire them. Soâcolleges and universities are failing industry. They arenât providing graduates who are trained in the skills companies need; they arenât nurturing critical thinkers; and they are pricing themselves out of the range of all but the ultrawealthy. What can companies do to acquire and retain the talent they need? Understanding industry needs isnât a static project. In 2020, the World Economic Forum estimated that automation will displace 85 million jobs by 2025 but will also create 97 million new jobs. Another publication estimated that there were 13 million unfilled technology jobs. In the 21st century, churn is ever present. Whatever your job is now, it will be different in five to ten years: Your skills will be obsolete, and youâll need to learn new ones. Thatâs a problem for both new graduates and experienced staff, to say nothing of the companies that employ them. And as weâve seen, itâs an even bigger problem for colleges and universities. To start, weâll look at what companies actually need, using data from OâReillyâs learning platform. There are two factors: course enrollments, which show what students are studying, and course completion, which may reveal skills in high demand. The median course completion percentage on the OâReilly platform is similar for B2B users and B2C users, and roughly matches industry standards. A higher completion rate could indicate that the course teaches an emerging skill that is required in industry. Examples of these skills are artificial intelligence (prompt engineering, GPT, and PyTorch), cloud (Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and Microsoftâs Azure AZ-900 certification), Rust, and MLOps. Itâs important to note that CISSP (the Certified Information Systems Security Professional) certification is on the list; although security skills are hardly a new requirement, corporate attitudes toward security have changed drastically in the past few years. Executives donât like seeing their companies in the news for a security breach. Some other topics with high completion rates are ggplot (for data-driven graphics in R), GitHub, and Selenium (a software testing framework). SolidWorks is an outlier; SolidWorks courses have relatively few users, but almost all the users complete them. What are people studying? The previous graph includes all users of the OâReilly learning platform. What can we see if we look at B2B and B2C users separately? Thereâs a high correlation between completion rates for both types of users on the platform. The Pearson correlation is 0.8, meaning B2B and B2C users move together 80% of the time, but there are some important differences: Individual users (B2C) are learning about technologiesâperhaps to help in getting a new job or to acquire skills they need in their current job, perhaps to help with their personal projects. Users who are coming from corporate accounts (B2B) behave differently. Theyâre learning skills that are important in a business environment: communications, teamwork, project management. Also, keep in mind there may be outliers here like SolidWorks, which could be a course an employer requires an employee to complete. Linkedinâs research on mapping skills to jobs led the company to develop a skills genome. Hereâs how itâs described: For any entity (occupation or job, country, sector, etc.), the skills genome is an ordered list (a vector) of the 50 âmost characteristic skillsâ of that entity. These most characteristic skills are identified using the TF-IDF algorithm to identify the most representative skills of the target entity while down-ranking ubiquitous skills that add little information about that specific entity (e.g., Microsoft Word). Essentially, this approach shows that you can rank skills by how often they show up in job postings. Skipping the math, hereâs an intuitive description of TF-IDF: Term Frequency (TF): Measures how frequently a word (or skill, in this case) appears within a document or job posting. A higher frequency might indicate relevance.Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Measures how common or rare a word is across a larger collection of documents (or job postings). Common words like “the” or “and” receive a lower IDF score, de-emphasizing their importance. We can accomplish something similar by doing topic modeling on OâReillyâs data. First, we find the top words associated with each topic. Then we use zero-shot classification to map the topics to jobs. That process yields results like these: Cybersecurity professional:– Matched Topic 1: [‘kubernetes’, ‘ckad’, ‘developer’, ‘application’, ‘certified’] | Score: 0.976– Matched Topic 2: [‘security’, ‘professional’, ‘certified’, ‘systems’, ‘information’] | Score: 0.918 Technology consultant: – Matched Topic 1: [‘kubernetes’, ‘ckad’, ‘developer’, ‘application’, ‘certified’] | Score: 0.579– Matched Topic 2: [‘azure’, ‘microsoft’, ‘az’, ‘fundamentals’, ‘900’] | Score: 0.868– Matched Topic 3: [‘linux’, ‘gpt’, ‘artificial’, ‘intelligence’, ‘go’] | Score: 0.623– Matched Topic 4: [‘learning’, ‘machine’, ‘deep’, ‘design’, ‘driven’] | Score: 0.527 The job âcybersecurity professionalâ requires skills in Kubernetes (including CKAD certification), along with security skills. A job as a technology consultant requires a broader group of skills: cloud development, linux, AI, and more. âTechnology consultantâ doesnât match to topics as sharply as does âcybersecurity professional,â but it still gives us a good starting point. After a bit of data cleansing, we can invert this mapping to find out what jobs are associated with any given topic. For example, take the titles of courses, then map them to topics, then take the topics and map them to job titles. For example in Topic 1, the skills âAWSâ and âcloudâ map to the job titles cloud engineer, AWS solutions architect, and technology consultant. This result is exactly what we should expect, showing that this approach to discovering the labels of skills mapping to jobs has merit.Topic 1 (AWS, cloud): Topic 1 (AWS, cloud): Topic 2 (Python, AI design): Topic 3 (Software architecture): Topic 4 (Kubernetes, developers): Topic 5 (Java development): Topic 6 (Microservices): Topic 7 (Security systems): Topic 8 (Microsoft Azure): Topic 9 (Linux, AI): Topic 10 (Deep learning): Topic modeling can play an important role in identifying job skills based on the topics learners consume. This could certainly be used by educational institutions to give them a competitive advantage. It certainly is used by companies like OâReilly, which provide training services to individual and corporate customers. But more importantly, it provides valuable information to HR departments about the skills they need to hire for. For institutions that can make use of this data, it serves as a competitive advantage. It tells them what roles the topics they teach are preparing the students for, and can help them plan curricula that are more relevant to the needs of industry. A university could use this analysis to look at external trends along with internal course popularity. Students may have unique intuitions about what skills they need based on job interviews and internships. Analyzing alumni data could show what job titles their alumni have had, which could be compared with the courses those alumni took while enrolled. What does industry need? The course completion data shows that students from our corporate clients are looking for soft skills like management, communications, and product management in addition to technical skills. While this might reflect studentsâ desires to âget aheadâ rather than corporate needs, companies are aware that good communications and management skills are essential and not taught in degree programs. And, letâs face it, everyone wants product managers. Topic modeling shows that corporations are looking for cloud skills, software architecture (a more senior skill to aspire to), AI skills, Kubernetes, Java, Python, microservices, security, and Linux. Except for AI, Java, and Python, itâs difficult or impossible to find courses on these topics in college or university CS departments. We wonât name names, but we challenge you to do your own research. Most of the schools we looked at offered one or two courses on cloud computing (though nothing on specific cloud vendors); we were unable to find any university that offered courses on microservices or Kubernetes, though no doubt some exist. If you take up our challenge, we suggest that you look at the course offerings in your stateâs flagship university, one of its second-tier universities, a community college, and two private institutions (one prestigious, one not). The less prestigious schools are more likely to provide training in specific job-related skills. If colleges and universities donât provide training on skills that are important to industry, who will? Responsibility would seem to fall squarely on the shoulders of industry. If you canât hire people with the skills you need, hire good people and train them. But is training available on the job? Too often, the answer is no. Why is that? An increasing number of companies are waking up to the need for corporate training programs, but in doing so, theyâre going against the last few decades of corporate thinking. For years, the incentives have been wrong. Stockholders want to see the price of the stock increase and pressure executives to use buybacks and layoffs to maximize their stockâs near-term value, often at the expense of long-term thinking. In The Man Who Broke Capitalism, David Gelles notes, Before [Jack] Welch, corporate profits were largely reinvested in the company or paid out to workers rather than sent back to stock owners. In 1980, American companies spent less than $50 billion on buybacks and dividends. By the time of Welchâs retirement, a much greater share of corporate profits was going to investors and management, with American companies spending $350 billion on buybacks and dividends in 2000. Training is an investment in the companyâand itâs a kind of investment that has gone out of style. However, forward-thinking companies realize that an investment in upskilling their employees is a critical part of long-term strategic thinking. Running a company as lean as possible to maximize short-term profit has dire effects on training: If expenses are cut to the bone, companies canât help their staff keep up with changes in technology, nor can they prepare recent college graduates to make the transition to the âreal world.â In turn, a workforce that lags behind current technologies leads to poor long-term outcomes. A staff that falls behind the curve or never makes it to the curve to begin with will have trouble developing successful products for the future. Shortchanging training only leads to a company that underperforms in the long term. Historical evidence supports the value of skilled apprenticeship. Internships can be small âtiger teamsâ that allow students to focus on specific problems with a mentor. Although we donât hear much about apprenticeships in the 21st century, internships (and even PhD programs) share many aspects of apprenticeship. Apprenticeships are an ideal way to bring recent college graduates up to speed on skills they need. They are less applicable for more senior employees who need to sharpen their skills or learn new ones as the industry evolves. Itâs important to remember what senior employees gain from mentoring junior employees. When done well, mentoring exposes the seniors to new ideas from their students. It requires them to think through everything they already know; talking and explaining solidifies their own knowledge. Many companies provide in-house training programs through products such as the OâReilly learning platform. Products like these can be integrated with the companyâs own learning management system (LMS) to create custom curricula depending on their staffâs needs and track progress through the learning program. This kind of solution works well for both senior and junior employees: A senior developer may only need to get up to speed on a few topics of interest, like AI, while a new hire might need to fill in basic knowledge they didnât get in school. Critical thinking presents different issues. Companies in which everyone is indoctrinated with the marketing literature and the annual report eventually fail; theyâre blindsided by new developments because they canât think outside of their boxes. Critical thinking isnât tied to any specific topic or skill, like microservices, but it can be learned in any context. Recently, our learning platform has begun to introduce options for interactivity, including interactive quizzes, coding sandboxes and labs where you can try out ideas, and challenge exercises that test new skills. All of these learning tools help teach critical thinking. Critical thinking skills can also be developed by reading books, writing about what you learned, and participating in study groups. Another key to critical thinking will be valuing teaching as suchâthe kind of patient teaching or mentoring that doesnât revolve around grades or student evaluations but that understands that all teaching is a process of exploration. To build critical thinking skills, companies need to go beyond providing courseware. They need to build a culture where all ideas are respected, a culture that encourages discussion, exploration, and failure. The need to train, upskill, and reskill job seekers isnât being fulfilled. Universities alone arenât enough to meet the demands of a changing workforce. There are no shortcuts. Learning requires doing; it can be messy, stressful, awkward, and difficult. But without the struggle to learn, there is no future: not for individual job seekers and not for the rest of us who rely on their productivity. For most students, learning is a matter of filling the gap between academic study and pragmatic skills. Platforms like OâReilly bridge the gap in bringing cutting-edge skills, certifications, and knowledge to students. Tracking need-to-know trends at the intersection of business and technology.

Title: For Microsoft, will Trump’s antitrust and environmental views help or harm?
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3610613/for-microsoft-will-trumps-anti-trust-and-environmental-views-help-or-harm.html
Time Published: 2024-11-26T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
I recently wrote about how President-elect Donald J. Trump’s actions on AI might affect Microsoft. This week, I’m focused on what his antitrust regulation and environmental plans — and the biggest wildcard of all, his personal vendettas — could do to the company. Trump believes that the less regulation on big business, the better. So you would expect him to put an end to antitrust suits against the tech industry. But that’s not necessarily the case. There’s no doubt that Lina Khan, the head of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) who has aggressively pursued antitrust prosecutions against tech, will be let go after Trump’s election. And many of Trump’s advisers, notably venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, would like to see tech antitrust prosecutions to stop. However, some advisers close to Trump, including Vice President-elect JD Vance, want the administration to take on Big Tech — mainly because they want to stop Meta and other social media companies from policing against misinformation, white supremacism, public-health health deceptions and election lies. Microsoft has largely been spared Khan’s prosecutions, even as the Biden administration has targeted Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon, and Apple. The one recent federal antitrust action against Microsoft by the FTC, for buying the gaming giant Activision, didn’t go well for the feds. A judge let the purchase go through, although the FTC has since appealed the case. That might make you think that Microsoft is in the clear under Trump. But The Washington Post reports the FTC will be investigating Microsoft’s cloud business for anticompetitive practices. In addition, the FTC appeal of the Activision case still stands, so that case could be revived. Trump could demand that whomever he appoints to head the FTC drop those actions. Odds are, he won’t, thanks to his main tech adviser, entrepreneur Elon Musk. His AI startup, xAI, competes directly with Microsoft, and is now valued at $50 billion after investments this spring from Andreesen and others. Musk also recently amended an antitrust suit he filed against OpenAI, adding Microsoft as a defendant. Don’t be surprised if the FTC under Trump not only follows through on Khan’s investigations of Microsoft, but also files an AI suit against the company, thanks to Musk’s influence. Trump believes climate change is a hoax. He’s vowed to tear up environmental regulations and attack green energy. His campaign slogan, “Drill, Baby, Drill,” and his close friendship with the oil industry make clear that he’ll do everything he can to increase reliance on fossil fuels and kill clean sources of electricity. He was also a booster of nuclear power during his first administration, though he wasn’t quite as enthusiastic about it on the campaign trail. Even so, the stock market price of nuclear-power-related companies jumped the day after his election, and most people expect him to be a nuclear backer. What does this have to do with Microsoft? Plenty. Microsoft has vowed to make itself carbon-negative by 2030, and Trump’s attack on green energy will make it more difficult for the company to find clean energy sources. Exacerbating Microsoft’s climate-change challenges is the fact that data centers that power AI require a tremendous amount of electricity. As I’ve noted before, Microsoft might be abandoning its promises to fight climate change because of that. And the company could also pour billions into reviving nuclear energy with a proposed deal to reopen Three Mile Island, the site of the worst nuclear power disaster in US history. Given Trump’s views about climate change and his support for AI, he’ll most likely do everything he can to give Microsoft and other AI companies all the electricity they want no matter the effect on the environment. And he’ll also likely let them go full speed ahead with nuclear power. In fact, Microsoft President Brad Smith recently said he expects Trump to cut environmental regulations to provide Microsoft with all the electricity it wants for its AI data centers. Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies — he worked on AI at issues the Department of Defense during the Trump and Biden presidencies — agrees. On a call hosted by The Information, he said Trump “can invoke emergency powers and waive a lot of environmental regulations to allow people to build new nuclear and other electrical generation capacity in order to power the big data centers that folks want for these advanced AI models.” He added that he expects that to happen “pretty early in the Trump Administration.” The president-elect is driven by vendettas and grievances more than he is by policy. And when it comes to tech, he has plenty of them. In the 2020 election, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife started a foundation “to ensure that everyone can vote and every vote can be counted.” Since then, Trump threatened to investigate him and send him to jail if re-elected, saying, “We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time, he will spend the rest of his life in prison.” Zuckerberg got the message, offering accolades, saying after last summer’s assassination attempt, “Seeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life…. On some level as an American, it’s like hard to not get kind of emotional about that spirit and that fight, and I think that that’s why a lot of people like the guy.” Then there’s Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos. When Trump was president, he frequently took aim at Amazon and Bezos because the Post published articles that angered Trump. He didn’t just criticize and threaten him; Trump also yanked a multi-billion-dollar cloud contract with the Defense Department from Amazon. This time around, Bezos is doing Trump’s bidding. He canceled the Post’s planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris even though the newspaper has endorsed candidates for president for decades. After Trump was elected, Bezos praised him, writing on X, “Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.” Those are just two of tech titans who have praised Trump even though he had targeted them. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has so far managed to avoid getting on Trump’s bad side. He hasn’t gone out of his way to praise the president-elect, either, offering Trump only a pro forma congratulation after the election. But with Musk as a Trump adviser, and what will likely be a big focus on AI in the new administration, it’s not clear whether Nadella will be able to stay out of Trump’s crosshairs. What’s also not clear is how Nadella will react if Trump threatens him — and how that might affect Microsoft’s financial future and its sense of itself as a moral company.

Title: Virtual Life Is Making Us Lonely and Unhappy. Can We Break the Cycle?
URL: https://slate.com/business/2024/11/remote-work-life-loneliness-isolation-human-doom-loop-zoom-virtual.html
Time Published: 2024-11-26T10:40:00Z
Full Content:
For a decade, my therapy appointments required a 30-minute train ride to a mid-rise medical office building in suburban Philadelphia, where I reclined on a black leather couch, grabbing the occasional Kleenex. But since 2020, I’ve simply closed my web browser (article drafts, credit card bills, LinkedIn feed), angled a 1080p camera so my therapist can’t see baskets of laundry and my kids’ stuffies, and spilled my guts. I sometimes wish I could still visit my therapist in person and even miss those train rides where I’d take stock of my week, but I have no choice but to log on: My therapist, like so many other professionals, has given up going into the office. Remote therapy has increased by a staggering 2,300 percent since 2020 and now accounts for the majority of sessions. It’s one of a number of in-person activities, such as watching a movie, taking an exercise class, or shopping for groceries, that were replaced during the COVID pandemic by their equivalents at home, in front of a screen. Five years later, the convenience, price, and time savings of remote activities have made them fixtures of postpandemic life. When I left full-time work earlier this year to go freelance, I finally landed that totally flexible schedule with no annoying bosses or co-workers. I didn’t expect that working from home would initially mean a 5-pound weight gain, and that I’d take my kids to school not just to make sure they made it to class—but to chat with other parents. It turns out that the simple obligation of going to a workplace, shop, or school every day brought positive externalities that are vanishing from our lives. There was the health benefit: Pushing a shopping cart at the grocery store or walking to and from the office parking lot meant getting in your steps. Since the pandemic, the number of trips made on foot has fallen by 20 percent. There was the social benefit: Being around others made us happier, but by virtue of spending more time at home, we now have fewer opportunities to socialize. Workplaces provided easy ways to form friendships or at least gab by the water cooler—a particularly important resource in a country where 15 percent of Americans have one close friend, if any. The advent of remote work and life has accelerated a worrisome 21st-century trend: We now spend 90 fewer minutes a week socializing face-to-face than we did in 2003. In a report released last year, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy labeled this an “epidemic of loneliness and isolation.” If Americans in the late 20th century had begun “bowling alone,” the title of Robert Putnam’s 2000 book about social decline, a quarter century later they were barely bowling at all. Given these reductions in social connection and physical activity, it’s no surprise that since the pandemic, Americans are less likely to say they feel active, productive, attractive, or in good health. “A lot of these key metrics that we track have sharply worsened,” Dan Witters, the research director of Gallup’s National Health and Well-Being Index, recently told the Boston Globe. “Americans have just not bounced back post-COVID.” Since 2020, many companies, such as DoorDash and Hulu, have capitalized on people’s tendency to spend more and more time at home. “There’s a real sort of push by these companies to ask: How do you keep people on the platform as long as you can? And how do you keep people going back?” says Steve Downs, a veteran of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation who co-founded the health nonprofit Building H. “Having all these products and services that make us less social, make us sleep worse, make us eat worse, we’re not heading in a good direction.” According to Building H’s biannual index of the health influence of consumer-facing companies, the ones that rank highly are those that encourage in-person activities, such as Specialized, which manufactures bicycles, and Culdesac, a real estate company developing car-free communities. Netflix scores even lower than fast-food chains. Throughout the pandemic, the media focused on the idea of the “urban doom loop,” in which remote work would kill downtowns, triggering a downward spiral of reduced services that would cause people to leave cities. What went overlooked has turned out to be the bigger and even more consequential story: the human doom loop, a cycle in which people stop connecting in real life, reducing the quality of in-person activities and the physical realm itself, further discouraging IRL activities, and so on. Nearly five years after the pandemic, it’s not the real estate we need to worry about. It’s us. When a Whole Foods opened in my neighborhood in 2016, it featured a ground-floor café where patrons could look out toward Philly’s famed Benjamin Franklin Parkway through double-height windows. Open an hour earlier than the supermarket, the café featured elaborate pour-overs and an afternoon menu featuring wine and beer in addition to food. Although Amazon bought Whole Foods in 2017, it wasn’t until the pandemic that the new owner ripped out this so-called third space. Now the ground floor resembles an Amazon shipping facility: The windows are frosted and lined with refrigerator cases full of groceries bagged for delivery, while patrons queue in a busy gauntlet, cellphones with QR codes at the ready, to pick up and return Amazon packages. It’s an example of a place where the pandemic tipped the balance between the digital and in-person worlds. In the past, the digital world serviced the physical one; now it feels like the other way around. I don’t spend much time lingering at the Whole Foods these days, and how could I? There’s a bidirectional relationship underway here; the growth of online goods and services is both the symptom and cause of a disappointing physical world. Consider the cab: Over the past two decades Uber and Lyft have all but entirely replaced free-flowing taxis in most cities. Taxis were imperfect, but now the option to reserve one without a phone has been nearly eliminated—and with it the option to move through the physical world without digital mediation. We are seeing this “Uber effect” play out in almost every realm. As more people shop online, everyday retailers like hardware stores and pharmacies are disappearing, leaving many consumers with no choice. Urban density once enabled niches, such as theaters showing independent films, bookstores carrying foreign magazines, or music stores keyed into the local sound. But now that online algorithms can match people with their interests, cities are losing that function too, and turning into mere showrooms for online brands. In Philadelphia, our prime Rittenhouse Square shopping area is these days home to digital-native brands, including Brooklinen, Vuori, Alo, Warby Parker, M.M. LaFleur, Framebridge, Interior Define, and LoveSac. These stores play a role similar to Amazon drop spots: They serve the necessary human element of an online purchase and little else. As cheap online entertainment grows ever more abundant, fewer go out to a theater production or to see an exhibit in person, and more cultural institutions cut back or close. Audiences for in-person culture are dying off: Just 10.3 percent of American adults attended a musical last year, and 4.5 percent attended a play—the lowest levels ever. The country has lost 4,800 movie screens since 2020. Angie Schmitt, the author of Right of Way: Race, Class, and the Silent Epidemic of Pedestrian Deaths in America, notes that at the same time people have fewer reasons to walk around and experience their communities, they’ve also been frustrated by the rise of homelessness, drug use, and other kinds of disorder in downtowns and on public transit. “That contributes to a lack of social trust,” she says. “And if people go out and have bad experiences, they don’t want to do it again.” Even as crime rates have plummeted from their pandemic-era highs, crossing the street has gotten much more dangerous: The number of pedestrians killed by cars is 14 percent higher than it was in 2019. The pattern is clear: The more we go online, the less we show up in person. And the less we show up, the less likely our physical realm will offer experiences that can compete. The truth is that we’ve vastly underinvested in our cities for decades, and tech companies have exploited this weakness. No wonder so many people feel safer and more engaged by what’s on a screen. “We have the world’s biggest companies, smartest engineers, most innovative content creators, working overtime to figure out how to keep us on our screens,” observed the New York University sociologist Eric Klinenberg, who wrote a 2018 book about the virtues of libraries, Palaces for the People. “And they’re really good at it. They have the best algorithms. They have the best graphic design. They know how to grab our attention and how to keep it. … In the face of that, it seems to me like our ability to convene people in the real world requires making a much more significant investment in physical places.” Of course, there are numerous neighborhoods in the country that offer an appealing physical realm—nearby schools with lively playgrounds for kids, curated boutiques, restaurants, modern offices, cultural venues, and health care resources. They provide lots of ways to stay physically active and to socialize in person. But neighborhoods characterized by their density of amenities, such as parts of Brooklyn, New York, or Cambridge, Massachusetts, have median home prices that routinely exceed $1 million, putting them out of reach for the vast majority of Americans. Ironically, then, the housing crisis is another thing keeping us at home. Because we’ve failed to build housing in our most amenity-rich neighborhoods and let them become too expensive, people have to live in less desirable neighborhoods without the same strong public and private investment in physical spaces. Farther from everything, residents have even less impetus to go shopping in person, attend a cultural event, or trek into work. If they have the choice, that is. In a cruel twist, the people in the most disinvested neighborhoods are the ones most likely to spend their workweeks at the jobs we once called “essential”—as security guards, health care workers, municipal employees, construction workers, and day laborers. They are the ones who rely on being able to run errands or pick up groceries and shop for necessities on their way to and from work. And as our physical infrastructure increasingly breaks down—with late, crowded buses because high-wage professionals are working remotely and reducing the farebox revenue for transit authorities, with shortened business hours for stores as brick-and-mortar retail becomes less viable, with more dangerous streets—these workers pay the price. There was a moment in 2022 when it hit Courtney Klein that something was not right. She was on a Zoom call while waiting in an Austin parking lot to pick up her daughter from gymnastics class. To keep her son from disrupting the call, she gave him a tablet to use in the back seat. Rather than sit in a car on their screens, she wished there were a casual, social place where her son could enjoy some playtime while she quickly hopped on a call (and maybe drank a latte too). Out of this desire, she created All One Thing, which she describes as “a new town square and a new third space.” For now, All One Thing is creating pop-up programming—community dinners, live music, classes for kids, and co-working for adults—in co-working spaces from Los Angeles to Asheville. Klein thinks moms can solve both the human doom loop and the urban doom loop at the same time: “There’s a billion square feet of empty office space. Moms will reimagine those spaces,” she says. It is one of a number of similar efforts. The surgeon general’s loneliness report has inspired Project Gather, a movement for Americans to cook and eat dinner together. Other initiatives were the subject of Join or Die, a 2023 documentary inspired by Robert Putnam’s work. To address the need for better social infrastructure, some cities are investing heavily in public spaces. New York has created the position of chief public realm officer to transform the streetscape, supervising permanent “streeteries,” pedestrianized plazas, and more family-friendly spaces to encourage residents to socialize, shop, eat, and exercise in person. In Paris, a public-private partnership, SEM Paris Commerces, relocates small businesses to empty storefronts, cultivating commercial strips that are far more interesting for strolling than scrolling. In Philadelphia, there’s talk of turning closed schools into multipurpose community hubs that will offer health clinics, food co-ops, even housing for teachers. Our youngest adults, Gen Z, have glorified staying at home, but that may be starting to change as that demographic enters the prime mating years of their 20s. Dating apps are now hosting in-person events, such as ice cream socials and line dancing. Run clubs have become nearly synonymous with looking for hookups. Members-only clubs have also increased in popularity. Maybe this generation, which has grown up online, has learned the hard way that you can shop, learn, exercise, stream, game, worship, and work on a screen, but you still need to connect in person to find love. Even so, these efforts are small when compared with the scale of investment coming from tech companies. Just one, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, has been willing to lose nearly $60 billion over five years investing in the virtual-reality business. We are rushing into a future of widespread A.I., autonomous vehicles, virtual-reality headsets, and mixed-reality apps. For all the talk of moving past the pandemic, the future actually looks a lot like 2020, when so many of us were stuck inside our houses and glued to our screens. We are at the beginning of a shift from a physical, public, and social world to a more digital and private one, accompanied by the instability that attends all technological revolutions. But it’s not too late to do something about it. Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

Title: 5 investing trends for 2025—and 15 stocks to help you bet on them
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/11/26/investing-stocks-gold-ai-etf/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T10:00:00Z

Picking stocks is about predicting the future. As investors can tell you, being early to spot a trend and betting on a company poised to ride it can translate to a handsome return. Those who bought Amazon in 1998, for example, or Tesla in 2012, or Nvidia in 2020 correctly foresaw the respective explosions of online shopping, EVs, and the AI revolution—and made out like bandits. Of course, this isn’t easy to do. One issue is timing. A thesis about the future of a sector might be correct, but it may still be years away. Betting on the right sector but the wrong horse can also be painful, as investors in bankrupt EV maker Fisker or fallen chip giant Intel can attest. In the past, a relatively safe way to invest in macro trends has been to buy so-called cyclical stocks (think travel or entertainment) when the economy is on an upswing, and defensive ones (think consumer staples) when times are bad. Today, though, broader forces like tech transformation and geopolitical upheaval have made this model less reliable. In recent years, for example, utility stocks—a classic defensive play—have been on a tear, while the dominance of the tech-heavy group of stocks known as the Magnificent Seven has been a bigger story than any discrepancy between cyclical and defensive stocks. The investment landscape may grow more unpredictable still as Donald Trump prepares his return to the White House. Nonetheless, Fortune’s finance team put our heads together to come up with stock ideas for the coming year. We began by identifying five trends, and then picking three companies set to ride each of those waves in 2025. In some cases, our picks reflect the ongoing march of technology. Other trends such as geopolitical risk—named by CEOs in a recent Deloitte-Fortune survey as having the biggest potential to create disruption—and health and wellness reflect broader political and social shifts. Finally, markets are unpredictable, so treat the stock picks noted here not as advice, but as a departure point for your own research into which companies might shine in the coming year. —Jeff John Roberts In recent years, the world has become more dangerous as war has broken out in the Middle East and on Europe’s doorstep in Ukraine, while tensions remain high in the Taiwan Strait. According to the think tank Institute for Economics & Peace, there are currently 56 armed conflicts around the globe, the highest number since World War II. Meanwhile, numerous reports show a year-over-year double-digit increase in cyberattacks, as bandits and national armies seek to steal data and wreak havoc. These trends are worrisome but also present an opportunity for investors. The conflicts around the globe have produced a shortage of weapons, particularly missiles and missile defense, making companies that cater to militaries a good bet for 2025. Ron Epstein, a senior analyst at Bank of America, says the U.S. is expected to spend around $1 trillion on defense next year, and that he has buy ratings on all the major companies in the sector. But he singled out RTX (ticker RTX) as occupying a particularly strong position thanks to its Raytheon division’s “fantastic missile franchise” and because its military business is complemented by a successful commercial aircraft unit. Those with qualms about investing in weapons may prefer to put their money into the cybersecurity sector instead. There are a host of publicly traded companies that tout their ability to protect networks and thwart cyberattacks, including the growing number of attacks generated by AI. But performance across the sector has been uneven, as underscored by CrowdStrike, which issued a faulty update in July that grounded Delta’s fleet of planes and cost the airline and other clients billions of dollars One cyber company on an upswing is Fortinet (FTNT), based in Sunnyvale, Calif., with well over $5 billion in annual revenue. Like others in the sector, it does not issue dividends and has a fairly high P/E ratio. At the same time, Fortinet’s share price has handily outperformed the broader market and most of its peers. Founded in 2000, the company is a trusted name in the industry and offers a wide variety of services, catering to a range of sectors such as finance, health care, education, and government. Some investors who foresee global turmoil roiling markets may prefer to avoid individual company stocks altogether, and bet instead on volatility and uncertainty itself. While there are ETFs that loosely track the so-called VIX fear gauge, such plays are for sophisticated, active investor and don’t belong in a buy-and-hold portfolio. A better option for those betting on ongoing turmoil is old-fashioned gold—specifically, through an ETF like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) that permits you to hold the yellow metal at a reasonable cost. While GLD prices sank in November after the election of Donald Trump, many expect the ETF to continue its recent strong run. Goldman Sachs predicts gold will reach more than $3,000 an ounce in 2025, as conflict and trouble keep the world on edge. —J.J.R. This year has not been kind to the luxury sector. The share prices of upscale companies like Burberry Group, Kering, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Movado are all down year to date. This is the result of Americans tightening their purse strings, but also because Chinese consumers—one of the luxury sector’s most important pillars—are feeling pinched by the country’s real estate crisis. But all this offers an opportunity for the discerning investor, says Jelena Sokolova, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar. For the past 30 years, data shows that a luxury down cycle hasn’t lasted more than one to three years—pointing to how high-end consumers can’t stay away from the finer things in life for long. Typically, the industry bounces back quite strongly after those downturns,” says Sokolova. “For a long term perspective, I think there is still potential there.” For the best bets in the luxury space, long-term brand preservation is everything, says Deiya Pernas, cofounder of Pernas Research. Whether the brand “stays true to its heritage” is a key differentiator in this sector, he says, as is its ability to expand its offerings into new categories. According to Sokolova, one brand well poised for a luxury market rebound is Prada (PRDSY), thanks in part to Miu Miu, its stylish sister brand and an up-and-coming industry power player. Its popularity among younger consumers—including those likely to benefit from an upcoming massive intergenerational wealth transfer—has helped the Italian fashion house defy the larger luxury downturn, as Miu Miu notched an eye-popping 105% year-over-year increase in retail sales in the third quarter, to around $347 million. Meanwhile, revenues for the larger Prada fashion group were up in nine months to $4.1 billion, an 18% jump. Another standout in the sector is ultra-luxury brand Hermès (HESAY), whose clientele consists of the 1% of the 1%, and which has been largely insulated from the slump that has seen the share price of rival LVMH fall over 10% year to date. The French-listed Hermès, in contrast, has reported double-digit sales growth every quarter this year. While other luxury brands have been disproportionately affected by slipping sales from their aspirational client segments, Hermès has more customers than it can materially accommodate: The wait lists for its most-sought-after products, the $10,000-plus Birkin and Kelly handbags, continue to grow, as the world’s wealthiest clamor for something they can’t simply walk in and buy off the shelf. Meanwhile, shares of Hermès competitor Kering (KER.PA) are down over 40% year-to-date but analysts expect a bounceback, making this luxury brand a potential bargain. —Alicia Adamczyk The world is consuming more energy than ever—and the trend is going in only one direction. Consider that a single Google search consumes 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, according to the International Energy Agency, but a similar query on OpenAI takes 2.9 wh. And then there are electric cars and our growing collection of always-on gadgets, which contributed to a global record for energy consumption last year, according to the Energy Institute. Powering all this is an increasingly diverse set of energy sources—all of which offer opportunities for investors in 2025. In a sign of the times, the AI boom is poised to resurrect Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. The plant’s owner, Constellation Energy (CEG), will spend $1.6 billion over the next four years to restart its undamaged Unit 1 reactor, betting that nuclear has the potential to deliver a massive revenue boost. The bet looks promising, as the company has already signed a deal with Microsoft to supply the software giant’s data centers with nuclear power for at least the next 20 years. The share price of Constellation, America’s largest owner of nuclear plants, has more than doubled this year. Wall Street expects the company to post yearly earnings growth of 30% for 2024, while Visible Alpha predicts free cash flows could reach $1.5 billion. Building new plants is a regulatory nightmare, notes CFRA Research’s Daniel Reuven Rich, which gives existing operators an advantage. “They’re the only game in town,” he says, and it’s become a lucrative one. A thousand miles south, and 250 miles off the coast of New Orleans, the oil and gas company TechnipFMC (FTI) is building an elaborate network of manifolds and umbilical cords for between $250 million and $500 million to help oil giant BP extract 80,000 barrels of oil a day. Last quarter alone, the U.K.-incorporated company doing business from Houston secured $2.5 billion in subsea orders, adding to a backlog of $14.7 billion. Shareholders received $394 million in dividends and share buybacks in the first nine months of 2024 alone. But ATB Capital Markets analyst Waqar Syed says that’s only the beginning. Even as the company is projected to pull in around $9 billion in annual revenue, Syed says the backlog means not all the cash has been counted. “Orders are coming in at a much higher rate than the revenues are,” he says. “At some point their revenue is going to catch up.” Syed predicts FTI’s future cash flows will increase 76% in 2025 to $859.2 million, and the company has committed to return at least 60% of its future cash flow to shareholders. Looking abroad, it may be a good time to consider Spanish energy giant Iberdrola (IBDRY). Through its public U.S. subsidiary, Avangrid, it has doubled down on its renewable investments in the U.S., particularly with offshore wind. The company has pumped a combined $13.28 billion into projects in America and the U.K. over the past year, helping drive a 50% boost in net income through the first nine months of 2024. —Michael del Castillo and Greg Mckenna Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the explosive demand for artificial intelligence has driven a broader stock market boom. Public companies directly tied to the field have seen their market caps skyrocket, while industries even tangentially related to AI—such as the once-unloved utility sector—have enjoyed a bump. Given all the hype, skeptical investors may fear the sector has crossed the line from boom to bubble, but many analysts say AI stocks still have room to run. Starting with pure plays, it’s hard to bet against the company at the heart of the AI boom: Nvidia (NVDA). There is a ravenous appetite for its flagship GPU chips from a wide variety of companies scrambling to keep pace in the AI era. One analyst closely following the company, CFRA Research’s Angelo Zino, said that Nvidia’s total addressable market is only set to expand. Its sales totaled $30 billion last quarter, up 122% from a year ago, and Zino expects the figure to surge upwards of $50 billion in two years’ time. He expects quarterly free cash flow to soon exceed that of every firm but Apple. It also stands to reason that Nvidia’s most deep-pocketed customers are the best positioned to make the necessary capital expenditures. “The big are only going to get bigger,” says Baird’s Ted Mortonson. “The monopolies are going to get more monopolistic.” Even among the giants of Big Tech, Microsoft (MSFT) is the leading high roller, with Bloomberg Intelligence projecting the company’s capital outlay could hit $53 billion this year. That capex is already generating sales, according to CEO Satya Nadella, who says Microsoft’s AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion. Microsoft has invested $14 billion alone in OpenAI since 2019—the main reason Mortonson believes the Seattle-based cloud titan is the best pick among the traditional tech outfits. Shares recently had their worst day in two years after the company forecast cloud growth to slow next quarter, presenting a potential opportunity to “buy the dip.” That may also be the case in application software, a sector yet to realize the benefits of AI. Salesforce (CRM) has been far from a Wall Street darling recently, with the stock trailing the S&P 500 and posting revenue growth in the single digits. Zino, however, believes the company is well positioned to deliver on so-called agentic AI—think autonomous digital assistants that put generative AI into action. “We think by the end of 2025 there are going to be a lot of investors that really kind of warm up to the Salesforce story,” Zino said. Not everyone agrees. Mortonson, for example, prefers cloud computing platform ServiceNow, which benefits from a close partnership with Nvidia. For those who believe in Salesforce’s long-term AI prospects, however, buying now could prove a bargain. —Leo Schwartz and G.M. According to a report by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association, the number of people getting active has increased every year for a decade. The report adds that threefourths of the U.S. population, or 242 million people, participated in at least one sports or fitness activity in 2023, a 2.2% bump from 2022. For investors looking to capitalize on this trend, the sporting-goods sector is a solid bet. According to David Swartz, a Morningstar senior equity analyst, the field includes names like Adidas, Lululemon, Under Armour, and Puma. But he says one company stands out above the others. “Nike (NKE) has a closer relationship with global and American sports than any other company,” Swartz tells Fortune. Nike’s stock has been pummeled this year over strategic missteps, including a failure to develop new products and a disastrous decision to favor direct-to-consumer distribution. But Morningstar believes it is now undervalued compared with its long-term fair value estimate of $117 per share. Morningstar forecasts compound average sales growth of 5% over the next 10 years, and expects Nike will achieve compound annual revenue growth of 2% in North America. Nike’s stock hit an all-time high of $177.51 in November 2021, but has since dropped by almost 50%. Swartz believes the company is poised for a comeback now that longtime Nike exec Elliott Hill is at the helm—he returned in October—and that Nike “will benefit from the growth of sports, both in the U.S. and globally.” Alongside the trend in increased physical activity is a new focus on self-care. This includes technology that identifies health risks for women, including breast cancer detection. A leading player in the field is Hologic (HOLX), a health care company with around $4 billion in annual revenue that provides 3D mammography technology. It has an 80%-plus share of the U.S. mammography imaging market and 30% internationally, according to Andrew Brackmann, a William Blair equity research analyst. Hologic, which has about 7,000 employees, also offers a range of tests for sexually transmitted infections as well as COVID-19. Since 2021, Hologic has scooped up seven companies and grown earnings at a roughly 10% compound annual growth rate over the past decade, Brackmann tells Fortune. Hologic’s stock is up about 16% this year. The growing field of prenatal diagnosis also offers an opportunity for investors, especially as preterm births in the U.S. have jumped by more than 10% in the past decade. In this field, Brackmann recommends a small firm called Sera Prognostics (SERA), which has created a blood test, called PreTRM, that helps identify which women may deliver prematurely. “There is a massive market need,” he says. Sera, which employs around 63 people, went public in 2021 but has never traded at or near its $16 IPO price. In August, Sera said it plans to publish the results of its PRIME study for the PreTRM test in the spring of 2025. Sera hasn’t gotten much traction with doctors, who have asked for more data, Brackmann says. “When the publication comes out it will generate a lot of buzz,” he notes. He expects Sera, which currently has negligible revenue, to bring in more than $100 million over the next three to five years. —Sheryl Estrada and Luisa Beltran At a time when the country was reeling from soaring prices, Fortune set about to pick 13 “inflation-proof” stocks. How did we do? In the 12 months since we published in November 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 delivered a 34% total return. Our portfolio: 51%. That’s not to say all our picks were winners. Two were blockbusters: chip darling Nvidia (total return, 193%) and big data company Palantir (179%). Other outperformers included e-commerce giant Mercado Libre and hefty dividend payers Kinder Morgan (pipelines) and Boston Properties (real estate). The other eight trailed the S&P, though none delivered negative returns. (Procter & Gamble, the worst performer, still gained 6%.) But overall, the home runs far outweighed the strikeouts. —Matt Heimer This article appears in the December 2024/January 2025 edition of Fortune with the headline “5 trends for 2025 and how to invest in them.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: 5 investing trends for 2025—and 15 stocks to help you bet on them

Picking stocks is about predicting the future. As investors can tell you, being early to spot a trend and betting on a company poised to ride it can translate to a handsome return. Those who bought Amazon in 1998, for example, or Tesla in 2012, or Nvidia in 2020 correctly foresaw the respective explosions of online shopping, EVs, and the AI revolution—and made out like bandits. Of course, this isn’t easy to do. One issue is timing. A thesis about the future of a sector might be correct, but it may still be years away. Betting on the right sector but the wrong horse can also be painful, as investors in bankrupt EV maker Fisker or fallen chip giant Intel can attest. In the past, a relatively safe way to invest in macro trends has been to buy so-called cyclical stocks (think travel or entertainment) when the economy is on an upswing, and defensive ones (think consumer staples) when times are bad. Today, though, broader forces like tech transformation and geopolitical upheaval have made this model less reliable. In recent years, for example, utility stocks—a classic defensive play—have been on a tear, while the dominance of the tech-heavy group of stocks known as the Magnificent Seven has been a bigger story than any discrepancy between cyclical and defensive stocks. The investment landscape may grow more unpredictable still as Donald Trump prepares his return to the White House. Nonetheless, Fortune’s finance team put our heads together to come up with stock ideas for the coming year. We began by identifying five trends, and then picking three companies set to ride each of those waves in 2025. In some cases, our picks reflect the ongoing march of technology. Other trends such as geopolitical risk—named by CEOs in a recent Deloitte-Fortune survey as having the biggest potential to create disruption—and health and wellness reflect broader political and social shifts. Finally, markets are unpredictable, so treat the stock picks noted here not as advice, but as a departure point for your own research into which companies might shine in the coming year. —Jeff John Roberts In recent years, the world has become more dangerous as war has broken out in the Middle East and on Europe’s doorstep in Ukraine, while tensions remain high in the Taiwan Strait. According to the think tank Institute for Economics & Peace, there are currently 56 armed conflicts around the globe, the highest number since World War II. Meanwhile, numerous reports show a year-over-year double-digit increase in cyberattacks, as bandits and national armies seek to steal data and wreak havoc. These trends are worrisome but also present an opportunity for investors. The conflicts around the globe have produced a shortage of weapons, particularly missiles and missile defense, making companies that cater to militaries a good bet for 2025. Ron Epstein, a senior analyst at Bank of America, says the U.S. is expected to spend around $1 trillion on defense next year, and that he has buy ratings on all the major companies in the sector. But he singled out RTX (ticker RTX) as occupying a particularly strong position thanks to its Raytheon division’s “fantastic missile franchise” and because its military business is complemented by a successful commercial aircraft unit. Those with qualms about investing in weapons may prefer to put their money into the cybersecurity sector instead. There are a host of publicly traded companies that tout their ability to protect networks and thwart cyberattacks, including the growing number of attacks generated by AI. But performance across the sector has been uneven, as underscored by CrowdStrike, which issued a faulty update in July that grounded Delta’s fleet of planes and cost the airline and other clients billions of dollars One cyber company on an upswing is Fortinet (FTNT), based in Sunnyvale, Calif., with well over $5 billion in annual revenue. Like others in the sector, it does not issue dividends and has a fairly high P/E ratio. At the same time, Fortinet’s share price has handily outperformed the broader market and most of its peers. Founded in 2000, the company is a trusted name in the industry and offers a wide variety of services, catering to a range of sectors such as finance, health care, education, and government. Some investors who foresee global turmoil roiling markets may prefer to avoid individual company stocks altogether, and bet instead on volatility and uncertainty itself. While there are ETFs that loosely track the so-called VIX fear gauge, such plays are for sophisticated, active investor and don’t belong in a buy-and-hold portfolio. A better option for those betting on ongoing turmoil is old-fashioned gold—specifically, through an ETF like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) that permits you to hold the yellow metal at a reasonable cost. While GLD prices sank in November after the election of Donald Trump, many expect the ETF to continue its recent strong run. Goldman Sachs predicts gold will reach more than $3,000 an ounce in 2025, as conflict and trouble keep the world on edge. —J.J.R. This year has not been kind to the luxury sector. The share prices of upscale companies like Burberry Group, Kering, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Movado are all down year to date. This is the result of Americans tightening their purse strings, but also because Chinese consumers—one of the luxury sector’s most important pillars—are feeling pinched by the country’s real estate crisis.

SolarZero, which said in August it had about 15,000 customers, has been placed into liquidation. Photo / File Kiwi-founded solar and battery firm SolarZero has been placed into liquidation. In August it reported it had around 15,000 customers, representing about a 40% market share. The company’s directors advised its more than 160 employees that due to “unsustainable operating losses and liquidity constraints”, the business was unable to continue trading in its current form. LATEST: SolarZero insider’s shock: ‘No holiday pay, signs of trouble’ and expert’s doubts about firm’s model “As a result, the company has ceased operations from 4pm today [Tuesday],” the company said in a statement on Tuesday evening. Customers posting on SolarZero’s Facebook page were concerned about their contracts being honoured. One wrote: “Our contracts still stand and we still get the second battery free after 10 years, correct?” Another asked: “Can we please have a heavily discounted liquidator sale buyback scheme? Feels like a liability on the roof now.” The Herald has put questions to the liquidators - Russell Moore and Stephen Keen of Grant Thornton. SolarZero said its directors had requested its senior leaders “take enforcement action” and appoint the standby servicer, Verofi, as the replacement servicer and that its shareholder appoint a liquidator. The company said its customers will not be affected by Tuesday’s announcement. In August, the Herald reported SolarZero, which was sold to US private equity giant BlackRock, said it had “pioneered a new financing model” to expand its debt funding to $195 million. Its chief financial officer James Allard said French bank Societe Generale provided $130m of the $195m, and Crown-backed NZ Green Investment Fund (NZGIF), a ‘green investment bank’ that lends money to environmentally-friendly firms, provided the balance under its Solar Finance programme. The NZGIF told the Herald it had been informed of the voluntary liquidation on Tuesday. “NZGIF provided lending to enable the installation of solar panels and battery systems by SolarZero,” a spokesperson said. “NZGIF is working with other lenders and the liquidator to understand the situation as it unfolds. “NZGIF acknowledges the hard work and dedication of the SolarZero team, having worked with it for several years as a lender. NZGIF does not have any further comment to make at this stage.” Customers of SolarZero could buy solar panels and a battery set-up outright, which often runs to $20,000-plus or, as most did, pay nothing up-front. The company continued to own all the hardware and the customer paid a set fee per month for “energy as a service”. Rates varied depending on the set-up, especially the number of solar panels installed. SolarZero’s statement said it emerged as New Zealand’s leading solar company, revolutionising renewable energy solutions for Kiwis after it was founded in the 1970s. “The company pioneered New Zealand’s first solar subscription service, making clean energy more accessible and affordable for households nationwide. “The company developed and operated Australasia’s largest virtual power plant, a critical innovation in advancing the region’s journey toward net-zero emissions.” “This difficult decision follows work to explore a range of options to restructure the company. “Regretfully, SolarZero and its key stakeholders were unable to find a viable solution to sustain the business,” the directors of SolarZero said. “This is a tough day for SolarZero teams, who have worked hard to build a more sustainable New Zealand. Today’s decision is not a reflection on their work or commitment. SolarZero would not provide further comment since liquidators have now been appointed. The company had key office sites in Auckland, Christchurch and Wānaka. -Additional reporting by RNZ.

Title: Trump expected to choose Kelly Loeffler as his agriculture secretary even though she was caught INSIDER TRADING during COVID

The latest expected pick is Kelly Loeffler, who Trump is reportedly about to pick for secretary of agriculture. Loeffler, a Republican senator from Georgia, reportedly sold $20 million in stock just days before the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) "pandemic" was declared. Back then, Loeffler was appointed to her seat "against President Trump's wishes," NPR reported. Now, Trump apparently wants Loeffler to occupy a top position in his cabinet. Trump and his allies pushed for Rep. Doug Collins to take what would have been a vacant seat, but that seat was ultimately filled by Gov. Brian Kemp with Loeffler. "She dumped millions in stock in companies to be affected by Covid after a classified briefing on the virus before a pandemic was declared," tweeted Whitney Webb (@_whitneywebb) about Loeffler's insider trading scandal during COVID. (Related: Did you know that just one day before Thomas Matthew Crooks reportedly tried to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump back in the summer a private equity firm out of Austin called Austin Private Wealth reported massive short bets on $DJT and $RUM stocks, which is similar to what happened right before 9/11?) Loeffler's husband co-owns crypto platform that Trump media wants to buy Loeffler's husband Jeffrey Sprecher is also part of a newfound effort to privatize natural resources like air and water through so-called "natural asset corporations." Sprecher, who chairs the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), joined the Rockefeller-backed IEG to implement natural asset corporations that are designed to securitize nature, "particularly parts of the natural world that have up to this point been considered part of the 'global commons' including clean air and water," Webb notes. "It can be used for predatory land grabs, especially troubling for a prospective head of the USDA." Webb further warns that Sprecher partially owns Bakkt, a cryptocurrency firm that Trump's media company just so happens to want to purchase. Once Trump is in office and Loeffler is head of the USDA, it appears as though the next step is for Trump to grease a deal with Sprecher that will benefit the two's private endeavors. A former board member of Trump's media company, by the way, is right now working to turn the precious Amazon rainforest into the world's first "internet of forests." The goal will be to monetize collected data while surveilling and ultimately ending the sovereignty of locals who live there. The same former Trump media company board member wants to tokenize each hectare of the Amazon rainforest with the help of a former top executive at BlackRock "who essentially invented ETFs," according to Webb. "Wall Street is trying to turn all of nature into tradable financial products and it seems like the next admin is down for that (esp. incoming head of Commerce Howard Lutnick!)," Webb warns. Natural asset companies, in case you did not know, are the epitome of climate change nonsense. They involve things like carbon credits, carbon capture, net zero, and more. "Most of the people around Trump's circle are Wall Street investors and they will get even richer in the next four years," warned someone on X / Twitter about the Trump grift. "They give the impression they will cut waste but will instead cut programs which will hurt working Americans." "I feel nauseous," wrote another who feels duped by Trump. "Humanity is not on a good trajectory and the fix (if there is one) seems beyond politics." The latest Trump-related news can be found at Trump.news.

Title: Even a dodgy Firework couldn’t mar day to remember for Gus McCarthy

As debuts go, not least for a 21-year-old hooker, it wasn’t too bad. A try, three try assists, playing the full 80 minutes, the last six of them in the back row, and Ireland winning 52-17 at home in front of extended family and friends. Not even in his wildest dreams could Gus McCarthy have concocted all of that. In a highly impressive, mobile and skilful display made, they are memories that McCarthy admitted he’ll cherish for the rest of his life. There are other too, not least hearing and singing the anthems. As that dream became a reality, as he thought of the route to this point, and those who helped him along the way, the tears streamed down his face. “I was pretty emotional, just because it’s always been a dream of mine growing up. I’ve always come to the games and sang the anthems. It was just a really, really proud moment, not only for myself, but more thinking of my family and the journey to get to there.” It’s funny how McCarthy and Sam Prendergast, the two 21-year-olds, took such contrasting routes to last Saturday’s landmark day for them both. McCarthy was captain, and Prendergast the undoubted star turn, in the Ireland under-20s side that won a Grand Slam and reached the Under-20 World Cup two seasons ago. Prendergast was fast-tracked into Leinster’s first team squad, making his first two starts later that season in South Africa, and his 16 appearances last season, amounting to 473 minutes, led to him being included in Ireland’s squad for the two-Test series in South Africa. By contrast, McCarthy played only 25 minutes for Leinster that season, in their April trek to South Africa, but all changed when Dan Sheehan suffered his ACL injury in the first Test before Rónan Kelleher, Lee Barron and John McKee were all struck down this season. In addition to four starts for Leinster and two for Emerging Ireland, McCarthy was hauled back from that tour to play the second half of the marquee Croke Park fixture. “I probably still haven’t taken in how lucky I have been to get some chances but I’m sure over the next few months I will reflect on that.” McCarthy reckons he played about half a dozen AIL 1A games with UCD last season, and while agreeing that it is a huge jump to Test rugby, he stressed: “But, no, I wouldn’t talk down AIL. There are some physical men. I’m trying to think of my last one. It potentially could have been Ballynahinch away or something like that, which is not a glamour fixture. We actually got pumped.” McCarthy started this season in the Leinster academy and so was, effectively, their fifth-choice hooker. “As well as Dan and Rónan there’s two other great hookers in John McKee and Lee Barron at Leinster, so I’m still competing with a lot. With the five of us it’s very competitive, anyone can step up and perform, as we’ve seen with the lads in the last few years. “So, I’ve just said to myself or when I’m speaking to my parents, and my dad especially, any opportunity I get I have to try to take it. I can’t wait around, especially in training. I just have to try to put my best foot forward and impress the coaches when I get a chance.” In the long term, it’s difficult to see how they can all remain with the province, but that’s another day’s discussion. Even after his unexpected flurry of game time with Leinster, McCarthy was only named as one of five “training panellists” in addition to the 35-man squad for this Series, behind three other hookers, so when he was named to start against Fiji he was as surprised as anybody. “When Faz [Andy Farrell] named the team on Monday I was incredibly surprised. I only got the call on Sunday evening at around 7pm that I was coming back in on Monday. I thought I was going to be back in Leinster this week. So then when I got the call that I was coming in to camp I thought I’d maybe get the chance to be 24th man and experience the match day. Then when I saw Faz put up the team and I was starting I was full of emotions. I was incredibly excited but also nervous.” His week had featured other highs, not least being presented with his jersey by a fellow former Blackrock College player and captain. “Caelan [Doris] actually gave me the jersey in the Shelbourne on Thursday night, which was very special: a fellow Blackrock man and to have the captain of your country present you with your jersey is very special.” To complete his day, after the game McCarthy saw his parents, Robert and Australian-born mum Tara, sisters Naoise and Millie and brother Hubie, as well as cousins and uncles. There was only one blemish. McCarthy was speaking to a small group of journalists in a passageway near the dressingrooms after Saturday’s game, where he was about to return and ready himself for something more daunting than starting his first Test match. That was to be his debut song in front of the squad. He revealed: “I’ll give a terrible rendition of Firework by Katie Perry.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Nvidia nearly doubles AMD's R&D budget – Intel's spending dwarfs both, but struggles to compete

The big picture: The competitive strength of hardware makers is often gauged by their research and development expenditure. However, an analysis of recent financial reports from various tech giants reveals that higher R&D spending does not always guarantee success. Intel's recent struggles and Nvidia's astronomical growth driven by the AI boom have broken conventional assumptions. Recent insights from Tech Fund reveal a widening disparity in R&D budgets between competing hardware makers AMD and Nvidia, a key factor in Nvidia's increasing market dominance. In that same mix we could look at Intel, which currently appears much weaker than both despite dwarfing their R&D spending. According to Tech Fund's analysis of Nvidia's and AMD's R&D expenditures over the past decade, Nvidia now spends twice as much as AMD. In 2013, their R&D budgets were roughly equal, but Nvidia's has since surged to approximately $12 billion, while AMD's has grown to ~$6 billion. $NVDA is widening the R&D gap with its closest competitor. Annualizing last quarter's R&D spend, NVDA is investing now almost at twice the level of $AMD. And the latter will have to split R&D between GPUs, CPUs and FPGAs, whereas NVDA can fully focus on building out the AI stack. pic.twitter.com/nL4BpTPNeU This disparity is further accentuated by the allocation of spending. Nvidia focuses nearly all its R&D efforts on AI, while AMD's smaller budget is spread across GPUs, CPUs, AI, and FPGA chips. Although AMD has made impressive gains in the CPU market – recent generations of its CPUs have soundly defeated Intel – it continues to struggle against Nvidia in the GPU sector. Intel currently faces seemingly endless trouble in CPUs, GPUs, and other areas despite outspending Nvidia's and AMD's R&D by a wide margin. Source: Tom's Hardware (click to enlarge) According to Tom's Hardware, Intel allocated $16 billion to R&D in 2023 – double the combined budgets of Nvidia and AMD. For 2024, the company projects R&D, market growth, and acquisition costs will range between $17 billion and $20 billion. These funds are spread across diverse ventures, including CPUs, GPUs, quantum computing, and foundries, with significant hopes pinned on its forthcoming 18A process node. Source: App Economy Insights Despite this hefty investment, Intel's market capitalization hovers at around $107 billion, ranking 160th globally. In contrast, AMD ranks 45th with a valuation of $229 billion or more than twice of Chipzilla's. Nvidia, with its near-total devotion to AI, has entered the $3 trillion club and is vying with Apple for the title of the world's most valuable company. Nvidia's meteoric rise is particularly striking when compared to Apple's R&D spending. The Cupertino giant spent $27 billion on R&D in 2023 and $31 billion between September 2023 and September 2024. While some predict the eventual collapse of the AI bubble, which could bring Nvidia back down to Earth, there are no immediate signs of such a downturn.

Title: Asia’s Largest Digital Bank Launches Retail Crypto Trading In Hong Kong—Details

Time Published: 2024-11-26T02:30:17Z

Hong Kong’s largest digital bank, ZA Bank, has announced the launch of a retail cryptocurrency trading service. According to the press release, the service enables users to trade cryptocurrencies directly through the ZA Bank app, “simplifying” the trading process by eliminating the need for third-party platforms. This move makes ZA Bank the first bank in Asia to offer such services to retail customers, reflecting the region’s growing interest in digital asset adoption. The trading platform is designed to support transactions in Hong Kong dollars (HKD) and US dollars (USD), allowing users to trade leading cryptocurrencies. To deliver this functionality, ZA Bank has partnered with HashKey Exchange, one of the three licensed digital currency exchanges in Hong Kong. The release revealed that HashKey’s institutional-grade platform, HashKey Pro, provides API trading, block trade services, and “enhanced” account management features, ensuring “secure and efficient trading” for users. Calvin Ng, Alternate Chief Executive of ZA Bank, noted: The rise of cryptocurrency presents investors with more diverse asset allocation opportunities. As a bank, we prioritise security and compliance, which is why we’ve partnered with HashKey, a global-leading licensed virtual asset exchange, to meet regulatory standards and deliver bank-grade security in virtual assets trading – our key competitive advantage in the Asian market. HashKey Exchange plays a crucial role in ZA Bank’s foray into the crypto sector. ZA Bank revealed in the press release that the collaboration leverages HashKey Pro’s infrastructure to “seamlessly” integrate digital currency trading into the ZA Bank app. HashKey Exchange CEO Livio Weng emphasized the broader implications of this partnership, stating that the initiative aims to drive the growth of the Web3 ecosystem in Hong Kong. We are privileged to partner with ZA Bank in advancing innovation in digital banking services across Asia. As Hong Kong’s largest licensed virtual asset exchange, HashKey Exchange is dedicated to providing users with fully compliant and secure digital asset trading solutions. ZA Bank, as the first bank in Asia to offer such service, has demonstrated its strong leadership and a pioneering spirit in fintech integration. Weng noted that as one of the three licensed exchanges in the region, alongside OSL and HKVAX, HashKey is positioned to support the digital asset industry’s compliance with regulatory standards. Overall, it is worth noting that this collaboration highlights Hong Kong’s efforts to establish itself as a leading hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation. In addition, collaboration and adoption have come when the cryptocurrency market has consistently seen recognition from major institutions and even countries. Recently, BlackRock launched options trading on its crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) product.

Title: ‘Any opportunity I get, I have to try and take it’ – Gus McCarthy knows what he must do with Ireland pecking order

Ireland's Gus McCarthy during the Autumn Nations Series match against Fiji. Photo: Brendan Moran/Sportsfile It’s hard to remember a better debut or a faster rise than Gus McCarthy’s. At the start of this season, the 21-year-old hooker had made a solitary bench appearance for Leinster on their tour of South Africa, and were it not for injury, he’d have likely lined out for their ‘A’ side against Munster on Friday night. Instead, he has propelled himself into Andy Farrell’s Ireland thoughts after making the most of others’ misfortune. That, in essence, is the game. He came into this season as Leinster’s fifth-choice hooker, but injuries to the other four opened the door in pre-season. He impressed and earned the No 2 jersey for the season opener, making such an impact that he was called up to the Emerging Ireland tour and then called home early to start at Croke Park against Munster. Still in the Academy, he earned a spot in Ireland’s squad as a ‘training panellist’ and was ready to go back to Leinster last Sunday, until he got a tap on the shoulder. He teared up when singing the anthem and his first lineout went astray, but when the whistle blew he was the picture of calm. He threw his first assist for Caelan Doris’s opening try, followed it up with a pre-assist a few minutes later and then offloaded out of the tackle for Craig Casey’s score. After half-time, he got over for a try of his own and set up Bundee Aki for his score. Aki got man of the match, but the hooker was hard done by. He may have been nervous, but the 2023 Ireland U-20s captain delivered an excellent performance – one that is rooted in his days playing minis rugby at Old Belvedere and his school days at Blackrock College. “Growing up, I’ve always played with the rugby ball in hand, always messing around with mates, whether it be at school or in the garden or at home,” he reflected. “I’d just see where the space is, and kind of scan up. “That is something I have to keep working on. Faz (Andy Farrell) is massive on scanning early, so that is something I have to keep working on. I was kind of happy. There’s a few chances that I saw an opportunity to give it early.” McCarthy wasn’t expecting to make the step up so soon. “When Faz named the team on Monday, I was incredibly surprised,” he said. “I only got the call on Sunday evening at around 7pm that I was coming back in on Monday. I thought I was going to be back in Leinster this week. “I thought I’d maybe get the chance to be 24th man and experience the match-day experience. “Then when I saw Faz put up the team and I was starting, I was full of emotions. I was incredibly excited but also nervous. “I was pretty emotional [during the anthems] just because it’s always been a dream of mine growing up. “I’ve always come to the games and sang the anthems. It was just a really, really proud moment, not only for myself but more thinking of my family and the journey to get there. It was just a proud moment for me and my family.” Already, there is a rush to get McCarthy out of Leinster where Dan Sheehan and Rónan Kelleher are established options. Kelleher is likely to start against Australia and Sheehan is back after Christmas, while Lee Barron and John McKee will have a chance to impress in McCarthy’s absence against Ulster this week. He knows he’s in a battle for game-time, but you sense he’ll back himself to get into that match-day 23. “As well as Dan and Ronan, there are two other great hookers in John McKee and Lee Barron at Leinster, so I’m still competing with a lot,” he said. “With the five of us, it’s very competitive, anyone can step up and perform, as we’ve seen with the lads. “So, I’ve just said to myself, or when I’m speaking to my parents, and my dad especially, that any opportunity I get, I have to try and take it. I can’t wait around, especially in training. I just have to try and put my best foot forward and impress the coaches when I get a chance.”

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “”The important thing is not to stop questioning; curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when contemplating the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of the mystery every day. The important thing is not to stop questioning; never lose a holy curiosity.” – Albert Einstein (from statement to William Miller, as quoted in LIFE magazine (May 2, 1955)) Number of the Week: 14 Drilling Records THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This Week begins with Richard Lindzen’s discussion on recent political movements that falsely claim to be based on science. Vijay Jayaraj discusses a conference of important nations that the legacy media missed, or misrepresented. Delancyplace.com discusses a few issues in Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Roy Spencer and John Christy discuss corrections needed to the measurements by satellites when the satellites drift too far from the planned orbit. Owen Klinsky alerts the US to the Winter Reliability Assessment by North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). Roger Caiazza continues to express concern over New York’s future reliance on Dispatchable Emissions-Free Resources (DEFR), that appears imaginary. A brief discussion on a Bomb Cyclone concludes this Week. ************* Rumors State: Some of the most misleading arguments for drastic action to “combat climate change” include phrases such as “The Science says.” Science says nothing; in physical science it is the physical evidence that reveals the validity of a claim. Writing in the American Mind, MIT Professor emeritus of Atmospheric Science Richard Lindzen reveals “How a political movement invented its own scientific basis.” He begins with: “Modern political movements have frequently laid claim to being based in science, from immigration restriction and eugenics (in the U.S. after WWI), to antisemitism and race ideology (in Hitler’s Germany), to Communism and Lysenkoism (under Stalin). Each of these falsely invoked a scientific consensus that convinced highly educated citizens, who were nonetheless ignorant of science, to set aside the anxieties associated with their ignorance. Since all scientists supposedly agreed, there was no need for them to understand the science. Of course, this version of “the science” is the opposite of science itself. Science is a mode of inquiry rather than a source of authority. However, the success that science achieves has earned it a measure of authority in the public’s mind. This is what politicians frequently envy and exploit. The climate panic fits into this same pattern and, as in all the preceding cases, science is in fact irrelevant. At best, it is a distraction which has led many of us to focus on the numerous misrepresentations of science entailed in what was purely a political movement.” Lindzen traces how the political movement began to demonize carbon dioxide, essential for photosynthesis, which creates the food required for all complex life, then asserts: “Excited politicians, confronted by this resistance, have frantically changed their story. Rather than emphasizing small changes in their temperature metric (which, itself, is a false measure of climate), they now point to weather extremes which occur almost daily some place on earth, as proof not only of climate change but of climate change due to increasing CO2 (and now also to even more negligible contributors to the greenhouse effect like methane and nitrous oxide). Such extremes show no significant correlation with the emissions. From the political point of view, however, extremes provide convenient visuals that have more emotional impact than small temperature changes. Birth of a Consensus The desperation of political figures often drives them as far as to claim that climate change is an existential threat (associated with alleged “tipping points”). This despite a complete absence of theoretical or observational support, and despite the fact that official documents produced to support climate concerns (for example, the Working Group 1 reports of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC) never come close to substantiating these worst-case projections. There was one exception to the obsession with warming, and that was the ozone depletion issue. However, even this issue served a purpose. When Richard Benedick, the American negotiator of the Montreal Convention which banned Freon, passed through MIT on his way back from Montreal, he gloated over his success. But he assured us that we hadn’t seen anything yet: we should wait to see what they would do with CO2. In brief, the ozone issue constituted a dry run for global warming. To be sure, the EPA’s activities still include conventional pollution control, but energy dominates. Of course, the attraction of power is not the only thing motivating politicians. The ability to award trillions of dollars to reorient our energy sector means that there are recipients of these trillions of dollars. These recipients must share just a few percentage points of these trillions of dollars to support the campaigns of these politicians for many election cycles and guarantee the support of these politicians for the policies associated with the reorientation.” The essay is a severe indictment of the IPCC and its collaborators who ignore the physical evidence in favor of politicized reports as found in the IPCC Summaries for Policymakers. Now in the 29th annual meeting (COP-29), the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are demanding trillions of dollars in payment for the imagined harm that carbon dioxide emissions from the use of fossil fuels are claimed to cause. Yet the use of fossil fuels (hydrocarbons) helped take the bulk of humanity out of dire poverty. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and After Paris! ************* Ignoring the Other World: In the sound and fury created by COP-29, the legacy media ignored or misrepresented another international conference that may become more important than the UN conferences – the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, now including other nations) conference held October 22 to October 24. Vijay Jayaraj of the CO2 Coalition writes: “Attendees of the 16th annual BRICS summit represented more than 45% of the global population and 35% of global gross domestic product and included representatives of Saudi Arabia, China, India, Brazil, and the United Arab Emirates. At the heart of the declaration lies a fundamental truth that the Western climate industrial complex often refuses to recognize: Access to affordable and reliable energy and economic development cannot be sacrificed at the altar of ‘decarbonization’ if people are to thrive. The BRICS leaders emphasize that their immediate goals — poverty eradication, infrastructure development, and economic expansion — require a secure and stable energy supply.” In BRICS-16’s Kazan Declaration, the attendees recognize that the path to prosperity is not from demanding payments from others for alleged harms from carbon dioxide, but by promoting affordable and reliable energy, as it has been since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The environmental ills created by industrialization can be and are cleaned up and are minor compared to the ills of extreme poverty. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ************* Randomness: The daily blog, Delancyplace.com, was founded by Richard Vague and financed by the Governor’s Woods Foundation. It has no particular theme but produces interesting tidbits. On November 20, it covered Randomness and Reality. The piece began with: “Today’s selection–from Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Randomness comes to Wall Street: “’Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette. First, it delivers the fatal bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands, of chambers instead of six. After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security. The point is dubbed in this book the black swan problem, which we cover in Chapter 7, as it is linked to the problem of induction, a problem that has kept a few thinkers awake at night. It is also related to a problem called denigration of history, as gamblers, investors, and decision-makers feel that the sorts of things that happen to others would not necessarily happen to them. “’Second, unlike a well-defined, precise game like Russian roulette, where the risks are visible to anyone capable of multiplying and dividing by six, one does not observe the barrel of reality. Very rarely is the generator visible to the naked eye. One is thus capable of unwittingly playing Russian roulette—and calling it by some alternative ‘low risk’ name. We see the wealth being generated, never the processor, a matter that makes people lose sight of their risks, and never consider the losers. The game seems terribly easy, and we play along carelessly. Even scientists with all their sophistication in calculating probabilities cannot deliver any meaningful answer about the odds, since knowledge of these depends on our witnessing the barrel of reality—of which we generally know nothing.’” Randomness occurs, such as an asteroid striking Earth and wiping out a whole class of life on Earth. These cannot be predicted or the causes known until after they occur. In climate history there appear to be random events that have not been explained such as the Younger Dryas, a period about 12,900 to 11,700 years ago beginning with sudden cooling and ending with sudden warming. Most life survived the Younger Dryas, a fact that is ignored by those who claim that the current slow warming will eliminate many species. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Changing Seas. ************* Imperfect Instruments: On November 2, Roy Spencer posted the October 2024 estimates of temperature trends which contains an explanation of a shift in calculations and why it was necessary. TWTW waited until the full Global Temperature Report for October by John Christy and Spencer was available before discussing this change. The full report is available now. Earlier Spencer wrote: [Boldface in Original] “Key Points Background Monitoring of global atmospheric deep-layer temperatures with satellite microwave radiometers (systems originally designed for daily global weather monitoring) has always required corrections and adjustments to the calibrated data to enable long-term trend detection. The most important of these corrections/adjustments are: The second of these adjustments (diurnal drift) is the subject of the change made going from UAH v6.0 to v6.1. The following chart shows the equator crossing times (local solar time) for the various satellites making up the satellite temperature record. The drift of the satellites (except the non-drifting Aqua and MetOp satellites, which have fuel onboard to allow orbit maintenance) produces cooling for the afternoon satellites’ LT measurements as the afternoon observation transitions from early afternoon to evening. Drift of the morning satellites makes their LT temperatures warm as their evening observations transition to the late afternoon.” Spencer graphically shows the drift in satellites used since 1979 with various truncations including the one for NOAA-19 and explains: “Note that the NOAA-19 satellite has drifted further in local observation time than any of the previous afternoon satellites. The NOAA-19 local observation times have been running outside our training dataset which includes the assumption of a linear diurnal temperature drift with time. So, we have decided it is now necessary to truncate the data from NOAA-19 starting in 2021, which we are now doing as of the October 2024 update. Thus, begins Version 6.1 of our dataset, a name change meant to reduce confusion and indicate a significant change in our processing. As seen in the above figure [not shown here], 2020 as the last year of NOAA-19 data inclusion is roughly consistent with the v6.0 cutoff times from the NOAA-18 and NOAA-14 (afternoon) satellites. This type of change in our processing is analogous to changes we have made in previous years, after a few years of data being collected to firmly establish a problem exists. The time lag is necessary because we have previously found that two operating satellites in different orbits can diverge in their processed temperatures, only to converge again later. As will be shown below, we now have sufficient reason to truncate the NOAA-19 data record starting in 2021. Why Do We Even Include a Satellite if it is Drifting in Local Observation Time? The reasons why a diurnally drifting satellite is included in processing (with imperfect adjustments) are three-fold: (1) most satellites in the 1979-2024 period of record drifted, and so their inclusion was necessary to make a complete, intercalibrated satellite record of temperatures; (2) two operational satellites (usually one drifting much more than the other) provide more complete sampling during the month for our gridded dataset, which has 2.5 deg. lat/lon resolution; (3) having two (or sometimes 3) satellites allows monitoring of potential drifts, i.e., the time series of the difference between 2 satellite measurements should remain relatively stable over time. Version 6.1 Brings the UAH Data closer to RSS and NOAA in the Last Few Years Several people have noted that our temperature anomalies have been running warmer than those from the RSS or NOAA satellite products. It now appears this was due to the orbital drift of NOAA-19 beyond the useful range of our drift correction. The following plot (preliminary, provided to me by John Christy) [plot in original and not shown here] shows that truncation of the NOAA-19 record now brings the UAH anomalies more in line with the RSS and NOAA products.” [Boldface added here] Spencer stated that the full explanation by Christy and him may take a few days “due to the changes resulting from going from v6.0 to v6.1 of the dataset.” On this issue the post on the “Global Temperature Report: October 2024 with Version 6.1” state: “In the last two months we’ve suggested some reasons for the continued exceptional warmth of the global atmosphere even as the El Niño was fading away. One of the causes mentioned was the possibility that the correction for the drift of the aging NOAA-19 satellite was unable to keep up with its continued movement and produced spurious warmth over the last few years. By comparing the two current satellites, and especially since Europe’s MetOP-B does not drift due to on-board propulsion, we’ve concluded that the adjustment for NOAA-19’s drift was inadequate, generating temperatures that were too warm as time went on. This same situation has occurred in the past where we initially utilized old satellites beyond their normal lifespan (e.g., NOAA-14, -15, -18 and AQUA) and retroactively removed the latest portion of their records when errors progressively became large enough to affect the anomalies of the last few years. We have now decided to terminate the inclusion of NOAA-19 from 2021 onward. With this adjustment we will identify the product as v6.1. At some point in the near future, we intend to include MetOp-C in the record, so this may introduce some minor changes at that time. This adjustment produces cooler temperatures after 2021 but does not change the facts that (a) 2023 was the warmest calendar year (and 2024 will be warmer still), (b) April 2024 produced the warmest single monthly anomaly, and (c) every month from October 2023 to September 2024 set monthly temperature records. The overall global trend was reduced slightly from +0.16 to +0.15 °C/decade by this adjustment.” [Boldface added] Instruments fail, and when they cannot be replaced, adjustments must be made for the failure. Unlike the adjustments to the historic US surface dataset made by NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI), Asheville, the adjustments made by Spencer and Christy are public, carefully identified and justified, and recorded. Their actions demonstrate integrity in science, a characteristic which NCEI, Asheville lost. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ************* Beware of Cold: Owen Klinsky of the Daily Caller alerts the US public of the limited resources much of the US has if this winter is cold based on the 2024–2025 Winter Reliability Assessment by North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). Klinsky writes: “Grid operators have requested the EPA nix the power plant rule in order to protect long-term energy dependability, with four major regional operators filing an amicus brief in support of red states’ legal challenge against the rule, stating it would jeopardize the grid’s ability to reliably meet American energy needs.” The Winter Reliability Assessment of NERC covers the three-month (December-February) winter period and evaluates the generation resource and transmission system adequacy necessary to meet projected winter peak demands and operating reserves. The assessment identifies potential reliability issues of interest and regional risks. It states: “Natural gas fuel to generators is threatened this winter by ongoing concerns with natural gas production and delivery in extreme conditions and a potential regional pipeline capacity issue in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Natural gas is an essential fuel for electricity generation in winter. While the natural gas industry is making progress on commercial practices and voluntary commitments to improve winter preparedness, supplies to electric generators remain vulnerable in extreme cold temperatures in many parts of North America, placing electric reliability at risk. As winter approaches, NERC encourages all entities across the gas-electric value chain—from production to the burner tip and the busbar—to take all necessary actions to prepare for extreme cold, keep natural gas flowing, and keep the lights and furnaces on. At the time of this WRA, the operator of a major interstate natural gas pipeline expansion project serving the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Northeast is facing legal challenges to the continued operation of the expanded pipeline. According to a recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) filing, a halting of the expanded pipeline operations would affect “firm transportation capacity in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.” These states correspond to the PJM, NPCC-New York, SERC-East, and SERC-Southeast assessment areas. During recent extreme winter weather events, each of these areas has experienced or come dangerously close to a shortfall in electricity supply for which fuel availability was a significant factor. Because foreseeable extreme cold temperatures have the potential to push the existing natural gas supply infrastructure to maximum capacity again this winter, a shutdown of in-service regional natural gas facilities would endanger grid reliability.” The failure of natural gas power plants in Texas during the last Blue Norther severe cold was due to the failure to have adequate supplies of natural gas on hand. This was a failure of the “just in time” policies of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). If this winter is cold, we will see whether this EPA and litigating environmental groups care about electrical reliability for the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast states.

Caiazza summarizes his previous work and presents another analysis by Tim Knauss, based on the work of Cornell’s Anderson Lab headed by Lindsay Anderson. Knauss writes: “To back up the massive quantities of solar and wind power that will provide most of our future electricity, the state power grid will need some new, mystery resource equal in size to the entire generating fleet of today. That level of detail sets their work apart. Many of the studies that look at phasing in renewable energy pretend that the electric grid is a single pool of electrons that flow from point to point without constraint. It is known as the ‘copper plate’ assumption. In reality, the New York electric grid is a complex, lopsided network that has been stitched together piece by piece over a century. There are limits on how much electric current can move from one area to another. Based on Anderson’s work, Knauss writes: “At Cornell University, Professor Lindsay Anderson and fellow researchers have been studying this problem. Given the specific layout of New York’s electric grid, they asked, how much of this new power source would be needed in addition to all the solar and wind? A staggering amount, it turns out. Just 15 years from now, the electric grid will need about 40 gigawatts of new generating capacity that can be activated regardless of wind speeds, cloud cover or other weather conditions, according to Anderson’s research. How much is that? It’s roughly equal to the total capacity of all of New York’s current power plants – nuclear, natural gas, hydro, wind, all of it.” The enormous needs for back-up to wind and solar have been noted elsewhere, and completely ignored by those promoting Net Zero. See links under Energy Issues – US. ************* Bomb Cyclone: A rapid intensification of a cyclone is often referred to by colorful weather commentators as a bomb cyclone. The implication is that it is not predictable. In WUWT, Caribbean sailor Kip Hansen showed a video of a cyclone off the Northwest Coast of the US, and he considered it to be a bomb cyclone. Meteorologist Cliff Mass, in the Northwest, has a daily series on his blog showing that the cyclone was well predicted over five days. See links under Changing Weather. ************* Number of the Week: 14 Drilling Records. The paper authored by Thomas Westerhold and 23 others “An astronomically dated record of Earth’s climate and its predictability over the last 66 million years” in AAAS Science on Sep 11, 2020, was based on 14 drilling records compiled in the International Ocean Discovery Program and its predecessor programs. As discussed in the July 15, 2023, TWTW, when Willis Eschenbach unraveled the data, it revealed that contrary to the assertion that Earth’s temperatures changed with changing CO2; Earth’s temperatures remained roughly constant with significant changes in CO2. See https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba6853 for the paper and https://www.sepp.org/twtwfiles/2023/TWTW%207-15-23.pdf for the TWTW. Censorship “Misinformation” Means “Shut Up” By Ron Clutz, His Blog, Nov 21, 2024 Link to: Misinformation Is a Word We Use to Shut You Up By Daniel Klein, Brownstone Institute, May 31, 2023 From Klein: What is being labeled and attacked as “misinformation” is not a matter of true or false information, but of true or false knowledge—meaning that disagreement more commonly arises over interpretations and judgments as to which interpretations to take stock in or believe. We make judgments, “good” and “bad,” “wise” and “foolish,” about interpretations, “true” and “false.” One day to make submissions about the Under-16 social media ban (excuse to force Digital ID on us!)

It calculates radiation reactions and radiation transport processes in all possible gases and gas mixtures according to the latest scientific and technical standards. Changes in atmospheric composition and density as well as their evolution with increasing altitude can be taken into account. HITRAN is used by scientists as well as satellite operators, meteorologists and the military due to the quality of its results. [SEPP Comment: HITRAN is the best database publicly available, but the precise number CO2 causing a warming of only 0.24°C is not clear.] Challenging the Orthodoxy Global Temperature Report: October 2024 with Version 6.1 By John Christy, Roy Spencer, Nov 4, 20224 Click to access GTR_202410OCT_v1.pdf Link to: UAH v6.1 Global Temperature Update for October 2024: +0.73 deg.

[SEPP Comment: Additional false claims of probabilities are exposed by Clark.] Tidbits By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 20, 2024 Politicians start with a dream, and when it goes sour, they too often refuse to admit it and instead prop it up. But the cost to the rest of us, including the poor to whom this money does not go directly from their fellows in charity or via the state, and the middle class whose power bills keep skyrocketing because politicians don’t know what “cheap” even means, is enormous. And how much are politicians’ delusions really worth anyway? We’re all Doomed. Yawn By Michael Kile, WUWT, Nov 21, 2024 Such a view arguably becomes more credible on discovering that WWA’s main benefactor is The Grantham Institute. It sits “at the heart of Imperial College London’s work on climate change and the environment, with the mission: “to lead on world-class research, policy, training and innovation that supports effective action on climate change.” [Italics by Kile] Grantham is right. Climate change has become a global “business”, presumably very profitable for “carbon” cowboys or green investors like GMO, at least unless the RE music stops for some reason, such as a decline in public gullibility about the “climate crisis”. Climate Debate on Social Media: Are the ‘Skeptics’ Winning? By Robert Bradley Jr., Master Resource, Nov 22, 2024 After Paris! Green Activists Are Coming for Your Money By Paul Mueller, The Daily Economy, Nov 18, 2024 Cheap energy means a future of greater freedom and prosperity for everyone. Because eliminating all emissions is next to impossible, companies are being encouraged (or required) to buy offsets from other companies or countries that purport to pull a certain amount of carbon out of the air.

The proposal would require these plants to cut their emissions of pollutants known as nitrogen oxides, which can lead to smog formation and contribute to asthma in people with long-term exposure. From ATSDR sheet: HIGHLIGHTS: Everybody is exposed to small amounts of nitrogen oxides in ambient air. Higher exposure may occur by burning wood or kerosene or near gas stoves or if you smoke. Exposure to high levels of nitrogen oxides can damage the respiratory airways. Contact with the skin or eyes can cause burns. Nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide have been found in at least 9 and 6 of the 1,585 National Priorities List sites identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), respectively. What are nitrogen oxides? Nitrogen oxides are a mixture of gases that are composed of nitrogen and oxygen. Two of the most toxicologically significant nitrogen oxides are nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide; both are nonflammable and colorless to brown at room temperature. Nitric oxide is a sharp sweet-smelling gas at room temperature, whereas nitrogen dioxide has a strong, harsh odor and is a liquid at room temperature, becoming a reddish-brown gas above 70 °F. Nitrogen oxides do not build up in the food chain. [Boldface added] How can nitrogen oxides affect my health? Low levels of nitrogen oxides in the air can irritate your eyes, nose, throat, and lungs, possibly causing you to cough and experience shortness of breath, tiredness, and nausea.

The End Of Polar Bears By Tony Heller, His Blog, Nov 20, 2024 ARTICLES 1. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy: The DOGE Plan to Reform Government Following the Supreme Court’s guidance, we’ll reverse a decadeslong executive power grab. By Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, WSJ, Nov 20, 2024 TWTW Summary: the authors begin with: “Our nation was founded on the basic idea that the people we elect run the government. That isn’t how America functions today. Most legal edicts aren’t laws enacted by Congress, but ‘rules and regulations’ promulgated by unelected bureaucrats—tens of thousands of them each year. Most government enforcement decisions and discretionary expenditures aren’t made by the democratically elected president or even his political appointees but by millions of unelected, unappointed civil servants within government agencies who view themselves as immune from firing thanks to civil-service protections. This is antidemocratic and antithetical to the Founders’ vision. It imposes massive direct and indirect costs on taxpayers. Thankfully, we have a historic opportunity to solve the problem. On Nov. 5, voters decisively elected Donald Trump with a mandate for sweeping change, and they deserve to get it. President Trump has asked the two of us to lead a newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut the federal government down to size. The entrenched and ever-growing bureaucracy represents an existential threat to our republic, and politicians have abetted it for too long. That’s why we’re doing things differently. We are entrepreneurs, not politicians. We will serve as outside volunteers, not federal officials or employees. Unlike government commissions or advisory committees, we won’t just write reports or cut ribbons. We’ll cut costs. We are assisting the Trump transition team to identify and hire a lean team of small-government crusaders, including some of the sharpest technical and legal minds in America. This team will work in the new administration closely with the White House Office of Management and Budget. The two of us will advise DOGE at every step to pursue three major kinds of reform: regulatory rescissions, administrative reductions and cost savings. We will focus particularly on driving change through executive action based on existing legislation rather than by passing new laws. Our North Star for reform will be the U.S. Constitution, with a focus on two critical Supreme Court rulings issued during President Biden’s tenure. In West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency (2022), the justices held that agencies can’t impose regulations dealing with major economic or policy questions unless Congress specifically authorizes them to do so. In Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024), the court overturned the Chevron doctrine and held that federal courts should no longer defer to federal agencies’ interpretations of the law or their own rulemaking authority. Together, these cases suggest that a plethora of current federal regulations exceed the authority Congress has granted under the law. DOGE will work with legal experts embedded in government agencies, aided by advanced technology, to apply these rulings to federal regulations enacted by such agencies. DOGE will present this list of regulations to President Trump, who can, by executive action, immediately pause the enforcement of those regulations and initiate the process for review and rescission. This would liberate individuals and businesses from illicit regulations never passed by Congress and stimulate the U.S. economy. When the president nullifies thousands of such regulations, critics will allege executive overreach. In fact, it will be correcting the executive overreach of thousands of regulations promulgated by administrative fiat that were never authorized by Congress. The president owes lawmaking deference to Congress, not to bureaucrats deep within federal agencies. The use of executive orders to substitute for lawmaking by adding burdensome new rules is a constitutional affront, but the use of executive orders to roll back regulations that wrongly bypassed Congress is legitimate and necessary to comply with the Supreme Court’s recent mandates. And after those regulations are fully rescinded, a future president couldn’t simply flip the switch and revive them but would instead have to ask Congress to do so. A drastic reduction in federal regulations provides sound industrial logic for mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy. DOGE intends to work with embedded appointees in agencies to identify the minimum number of employees required at an agency for it to perform its constitutionally permissible and statutorily mandated functions. The number of federal employees to cut should be at least proportionate to the number of federal regulations that are nullified: Not only are fewer employees required to enforce fewer regulations, but the agency would produce fewer regulations once its scope of authority is properly limited. Employees whose positions are eliminated deserve to be treated with respect, and DOGE’s goal is to help support their transition into the private sector. The president can use existing laws to give them incentives for early retirement and to make voluntary severance payments to facilitate a graceful exit. Conventional wisdom holds that statutory civil-service protections stop the president or even his political appointees from firing federal workers. The purpose of these protections is to protect employees from political retaliation. But the statute allows for ‘reductions in force’ that don’t target specific employees. The statute further empowers the president to ‘prescribe rules governing the competitive service.’ That power is broad. Previous presidents have used it to amend the civil service rules by executive order, and the Supreme Court has held—in Franklin v. Massachusetts (1992) and Collins v. Yellen (2021) that they weren’t constrained by the Administrative Procedures Act when they did so. With this authority, Mr. Trump can implement any number of ‘rules governing the competitive service’ that would curtail administrative overgrowth, from large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area. Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome: If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home. Finally, we are focused on delivering cost savings for taxpayers. Skeptics question how much federal spending DOGE can tame through executive action alone. They point to the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, which stops the president from ceasing expenditures authorized by Congress. Mr. Trump has previously suggested this statute is unconstitutional, and we believe the current Supreme Court would likely side with him on this question. But even without relying on that view, DOGE will help end federal overspending by taking aim at the $500 billion plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended, from $535 million a year to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and $1.5 billion for grants to international organizations to nearly $300 million to progressive groups like Planned Parenthood. TWTW Comment: A promising start to a difficult task. Contrary to those who claim that in ending the Chevron Deference, judges will replace bureaucrats for expert judgement; it will be the lawmakers who will need to do so. That is where the Constitution places the authority and the requirement for such expertise. Congress will not be able to pass the buck on difficult decisions by deferring to bureaucrats. I hope that Microsoft’s nuclear power doesn’t crash or freeze like its software sometimes does. CTRL + ALT + DEL solves EVERYTHING. Not everything. Somedays it is the off/on button that works best.

Title: No Fianna Fáil 2011-type disaster for Sinn Féin but repeat of their 2020 success looks unlikely

Full Content:
During the local and European elections earlier this year, Sinn Féin canvassers in some of its heartlands area in Dublin were confronted with hostility on doorsteps. The flashpoint was immigration. Tents erected by asylum seekers were lined along the canal. Around the State, there were stand-offs with local residents over proposed accommodation centres. In Dublin, Sinn Féin was facing headwinds in some of its strongest areas, such as west Finglas, Coolock, Ballyfermot and the north inner city. At some doorsteps, the party’s candidates were called “traitors” and “unpatriotic”. In Coolock, a party member was attacked, sustaining a broken nose. Sinn Féin had a poor election. But then, it also had poor local and European elections in 2019 but bounced back spectacularly in the general election seven months later. This time, though, the journey back seemed more perilous. When supporters turn against a party it is never a pretty sight. For a while, it seemed this general election for Sinn Féin might be a minor version of what happened to Fianna Fáil in 2011 after the farcical collapse of its government. Back then, Fianna Fáil candidates faced similar anger from voters. Outgoing TD Mary Hanafin was standing at a school gate in Blackrock as one young parent guided her young child through the gates. “Hi, I am looking for your support,” said Hanafin pleasantly. “Fianna Fáil?” the woman asked. Before Hanafin could reply, she snarled: “I would rather stick pins in my eyes. You are a load of gangsters.” That was then, this is now. Following candidates from different parties across five Dublin constituencies this time, it’s clear it’s not going to be a 2011 for Sinn Féin. Soon after this summer’s elections, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald visited many key Dublin heartlands spoke to community leaders, in order to lance the boil. The party also did a volte face on its immigration policies. Since then, too, the issue has become less fraught and emotional. Two Sinn Féin TDs, Eoin Ó Broin and Mark Ward, are canvassing in Moorfield, a settled and attractive estate in north Clondalkin, where it usually pulls in 50 per cent of the vote. Ó Broin is an impressive operator on the ground. In another life, he would have made a great GP, with a mix of empathy and infinite patience for everybody he meets. “We would have estimated during the [summer election] about 10 per cent talked about migration and the accommodation issues,” he says. “A lot of those conversations were decent. People wanted to know what’s going on and were expressing concerns. There was a portion of exchanges which were hostile.” He said the issue is still being raised but not as often. “It’s perhaps the second or third issue. It does not have the same salience. At the time, it was soon after the riots and there were tents along the canal.” The cost of living, housing, tax and access to healthcare are also big issues. A young woman says her partner earns €50,000 and wants to know if there will be a change in tax bands as he feels the impact of cost-of-living hikes. Ó Broin explains the Sinn Féin plan to scrap the Universal Social Charge for anybody earning under €45,000. There is not enormous engagement. There are some pledged votes, some are non-committal. “We are still thinking,” one woman tells the Sinn Féin canvassers. “We really need a change,” Ó Broin urges her. “We are the only party that can do it.” There is only one hard “No”, an immediate door slam. In another house, a relatively young woman says she can’t vote for Sinn Féin because of “legacy issues”. Canvassing in Dún Laoghaire, the Green Party’s Ossian Smyth says that at this juncture in the campaign four years ago, the pension age issue championed by Sinn Féin had really taken hold and that people on doorsteps in all areas were talking about “change” and “Mary Lou”. “We are not hearing it this time,” he says. There is no doubt in Dublin the Greens are feeling the negative effects of being the small party in Government. On the other hand, there has been a defanging of voter toxicity around Labour and Fianna Fáil. In Tallaght, Fianna Fáil’s Teresa Costello is campaigning on the basis of her working-class roots and her understanding of the community. A cancer survivor and advocate, Costello is chatty and pleasant and gets positive engagement. She gets a few commitments of support but it’s striking how many people on the doorsteps have yet to commit. The bicycle shed invariably crops up. “For the name of Holy God, somebody get hold of the Office of Public Works and, for feck’s sake, tell them to stop spending money like it’s going out of fashion. There doesn’t seem to be any accountability,” a woman in Kingswood tells Costello. “The other thing is the national children’s hospital. Nobody called a halt to that.” One man tells her that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have been in power for too long. “It’s time to give Sinn Féin a twist,” he says. In Beaumont, Paul McAuliffe of Fianna Fáil chats to a manwhose daughter has just graduated as a teacher but who, owing to cost-of-living issues and the cost of houses, will find it hard to stay in Dublin. “Her friends in the [teaching] class are thinking of going to Australia. It’s all to do with the cost of living,” he says. McAuliffe points to the nearby new residential development of 800 homes on Oscar Traynor Road, saying the three-bedroom units will be available to some families at €360,000. The Labour candidate in Dublin South-West Ciarán Ahern is canvassing in Kimmage along with party leader Ivana Bacik. A couple in their 60s say they are worried about “so many people looking for social housing and being on the dole”. The man says: “I wasn’t handed a house. My kids weren’t handed their houses. When I hear people saying it’s a basic human right to have a house, and the Government should be building more houses for people, and it should be beside the mammy. I don’t agree with that.” Immigration is mentioned, but more sporadically than in the summer. “We have loads of immigrants coming in, and they lose their passports between getting off the plane and arriving. I think that they should be sent back to wherever they came from,” the man in Kimmage tells Ahern and Bacik. He says he has no trouble with people arriving who are willing to work in Ireland. They tell him Labour is the party of work and have proposals to ensure that all immigrants, including asylum seekers, can be allowed to work. But no one issue is yet dominating, as housing did in 2020. Nor does there seem to be any huge momentum behind any party. Perhaps we are looking at a scenario like the 2007 general election campaign, where after a fortnight of shadow boxing, everything was decided in the last week? © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office as part of his efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices on everything from gas to automobiles. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday that on his first day in office he will impose a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The announcement sparked a dollar rally. It rose 1% against the Canadian dollar and 2% against the Mexican peso, while share markets in Asia fell, as did European equity futures ratcheting up concerns about his America First policies. Crude oil prices on Monday settled sharply lower on the back of speculation over a cease-fire in Lebanon, combined with what appears to be restraint on the part of Iran. U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron are expected to announce a ceasefire in Lebanon between armed group Hezbollah and Israel imminently, four senior Lebanese sources said on Monday. Asian shares were mostly lower on Tuesday on the back of Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on China, which could have an impact on other Asian economies. Nifty rose again on Nov 25 adding nearly 4% in two consecutive sessions of gains to regain its losses on a month-on-month basis. At close, Nifty was up 1.32% or 314.7 points at 24221.9. A small negative candle was formed on the daily chart with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this pattern indicates an upside breakout for the Nifty with an unfilled opening upside gap. If this gap remains unfilled for the next few sessions, it may mean formation of an important bottom reversal for Nifty around 23263 levels. In the near term 24500 could still pose some resistance for the Nifty while 23900 could offer support.

Title: Crypto firm Prometheum gained an edge under Gary Gensler’s SEC. Suddenly its future appears less certain

For years, the crypto industry has complained about the Securities and Exchange Commission’s hard-line stance, and its refusal to develop rules that account for blockchain’s distinct technology. One firm, though, claimed the SEC’s current crypto rules are just fine. This stance has paid off as the firm, Prometheum, won a first-of-its-kind license for crypto-based securities and—despite being virtually unknown in the crypto world—landed a prestigious slot in 2023 to testify about digital assets before Congress. But now Prometheum has a problem. The election of pro-crypto Donald Trump has led SEC Chair Gary Gensler to announce he will quit his position early next year. So now the firm—whose apparent inside track with the regulator appeared to give it an edge—must compete in a world where the rules of the crypto game are shifting dramatically. Most notably, there is an emerging consensus that many cryptocurrencies will not be considered securities when Trump is president. This is different from the current regulatory environment, where SEC’s Gensler has signaled that every token other than Bitcoin is a security, and filed lawsuits that have forced companies to delist popular tokens like Solana and XRP. Since the election, however, firms like Coinbase and Robinhood have re-listed those assets in anticipation of an incoming SEC chair who will not treat those tokens as securities. This is a potential problem for Prometheum since its business model has been based in large part on selling itself as a platform where crypto tokens are securities, and obtaining the legal infrastructure to support that. It’s unclear where this leaves Prometheum, which has attracted widespread derision from crypto figures over its role as Gensler’s model for the industry. Meanwhile, the firm faces an incoming Congress controlled by hostile Republicans, including figures like John Rose (R-Tenn.), who have accused it of having ties to China. Prometheum strongly denies that allegation. In response to questions from Fortune about Prometheum’s future in a post-Gensler world, the firm supplied written answers from Aaron Kaplan, who shares CEO duties with his brother. According to Kaplan, Prometheum has an opportunity to move beyond crypto and use its first-of-its-kind license (known as special purpose broker-dealer) to offer a wide variety of assets, including “equities, debt instruments, structured products, options, ETFs, money market funds” and more in the form of securities on a blockchain. “We expect that President Trump’s administration will oversee this market transformation as trillions of securities are issued on a blockchain, ushering in the benefits that blockchain technology has long promised market participants,” Kaplan wrote. Others are not so sure. Matt Walsh, cofounder of the influential crypto venture capital firm Castle Island who has been an outspoken critic of Prometheum, told Fortune he has seen little in the way of evidence that anyone is using the firm’s platform for real-world trading. And while financial giants like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, alongside crypto native firms like Superstate, are dabbling in tokenized traditional assets, this remains for now a very niche area of finance. In response to a question about whether Prometheum can point to real-world clients or other evidence of gaining traction in the market, Kaplan said the firm is still in “the very early stages” and that it is “actively engaged in discussions with financial institutions.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: From Bitcoin to Altcoins: Crypto Inflows Hit Record $3.1 Billion, Led by Spot ETFs
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/from-bitcoin-to-altcoins-crypto-inflows-hit-record-3-1-billion-led-by-spot-etfs/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T00:30:20Z

The crypto market witnessed a significant milestone last week as investment products recorded roughly $3.13 billion in net inflows globally, primarily driven by US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to data from CoinShares. This surge highlights growing institutional interest and confidence in the crypto market, with Bitcoin leading the charge. CoinShares reveals that the year-to-date net inflows into crypto funds have reached $37 billion, while total assets under management (AUM) soared to a new high of $153 billion. The recent inflows mark the seventh consecutive week of positive movements for global crypto investment products managed by leading firms such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and ProShares. A substantial portion of last week’s inflows, approximately $2.05 billion, originated from BlackRock’s IBIT product, underlining the dominance of US-based funds in the global space. These inflows outpaced the first-year debut of US gold ETFs, which attracted only $309 million. Bitcoin-based funds were at the forefront of the inflows, contributing $3 billion of the weekly total. This inflow coincided with Bitcoin’s continued price rally, drawing additional interest from institutional and retail investors. However, the higher prices also spurred a notable $10 million inflow into short-Bitcoin products, bringing the monthly figure for these products to $58 million — the highest since August 2022. While Bitcoin dominated, altcoins also attracted significant investment. Solana emerged as the second-most popular asset among institutional investors, with net weekly inflows of $16 million, surpassing Ethereum’s $2.8 million. Other altcoin-based funds also saw notable inflows, with XRP, Litecoin, and Chainlink attracting $15 million, $4.1 million, and $1.3 million, respectively. These inflows suggest growing confidence in the broader altcoin market, driven by price rallies and increasing adoption. US-based funds’ dominance was evident in regional fund flows, accounting for $3.2 billion in net weekly inflows. However, this was slightly “offset” by outflows from European markets, including $84 million, $40 million, and $17 million from crypto investment products in Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland, respectively. Despite these regional outflows, the overall trend remains bullish, driven largely by institutional participation in the US market. Notably, CoinShares’s continuous inflows reflect a combination of factors, including the market’s positive sentiment regarding the bull run and the increasing acceptance of crypto as a legitimate asset class. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a pivotal development. It provides institutional investors with a regulated avenue to gain exposure to digital assets. As a result, the cryptocurrency market is witnessing a shift toward mainstream adoption, further supported by strong price performance and consistent inflows across various investment products.

Meet Samuel Edyme, Nickname - HIM-buktu. A web3 content writer, journalist, and aspiring trader, Edyme is as versatile as they come. With a knack for words and a nose for trends, he has penned pieces for numerous industry player, including AMBCrypto, Blockchain.News, and Blockchain Reporter, among others. Edyme’s foray into the crypto universe is nothing short of cinematic. His journey began not with a triumphant investment, but with a scam. Yes, a Ponzi scheme that used crypto as payment roped him in. Rather than retreating, he emerged wiser and more determined, channeling his experience into over three years of insightful market analysis. Before becoming the voice of reason in the crypto space, Edyme was the quintessential crypto degen. He aped into anything that promised a quick buck, anything ape-able, learning the ropes the hard way. These hands-on experience through major market events—like the Terra Luna crash, the wave of bankruptcies in crypto firms, the notorious FTX collapse, and even CZ’s arrest—has honed his keen sense of market dynamics. When he isn’t crafting engaging crypto content, you’ll find Edyme backtesting charts, studying both forex and synthetic indices. His dedication to mastering the art of trading is as relentless as his pursuit of the next big story. Away from his screens, he can be found in the gym, airpods in, working out and listening to his favorite artist, NF. Or maybe he’s catching some Z’s or scrolling through Elon Musk’s very own X platform—(oops, another screen activity, my bad…) Well, being an introvert, Edyme thrives in the digital realm, preferring online interaction over offline encounters—(don’t judge, that’s just how he is built). His determination is quite unwavering to be honest, and he embodies the philosophy of continuous improvement, or “kaizen,” striving to be 1% better every day. His mantras, “God knows best” and “Everything is still on track,” reflect his resilient outlook and how he lives his life. In a nutshell, Samuel Edyme was born efficient, driven by ambition, and perhaps a touch fierce. He’s neither artistic nor unrealistic, and certainly not chauvinistic. Think of him as Bruce Willis in a train wreck—unflappable. Edyme is like trading in your car for a jet—bold. He’s the guy who’d ask his boss for a pay cut just to prove a point—(uhhh…). He is like watching your kid take his first steps. Imagine Bill Gates struggling with rent—okay, maybe that’s a stretch, but you get the idea, yeah. Unbelievable? Yes. Inconceivable? Perhaps. Edyme sees himself as a fairly reasonable guy, albeit a bit stubborn. Normal to you is not to him. He is not the one to take the easy road, and why would he? That’s just not the way he roll. He has these favorite lyrics from NF’s “Clouds” that resonate deeply with him: “What you think's probably unfeasible, I've done already a hundredfold.” PS—Edyme is HIM. HIM-buktu. Him-mulation. Him-Kardashian. Himon and Pumba. He even had his DNA tested, and guess what? He’s 100% Him-alayan. Screw it, he ate the opp. Disclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

Title: Meta could outdo Google in the AI transformation, professor says

Despite being one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence research, Google (GOOGL+0.07%) isn’t poised to be a winner of the transformation, according to a business professor. “While Google may have blazed the trail in artificial intelligence, it’s Meta (META-0.75%) that’s poised to reap the rewards,” Howard Yu, LEGO Professor of Management and Innovation at IMD Business School, said in a written piece shared with Quartz. The reason according to Yu, who also leads the Center for Future Readiness, is about business models. “Google’s core business model — built on the elegance of simple search and link-clicking — is actually being undermined by AI,” Yu said, “while Meta’s advertising ecosystem is being supercharged by it.” For example, Meta’s AI-powered advertising system has been able to adapt after Apple’s (AAPL-0.03%) introduction of its App Tracking Transparency feature, Yu said, which requires iOS apps to request user permission to track activity. Before, advertisers could track how users bought a product after seeing an ad. The tech giant’s probabilistic models “are working better than the old tracking system ever did,” Yu said. Meta is also “erasing the line between content and advertising,” Yu said, by using AI to make items in images and videos on social media feeds purchasable. The company “isn’t just creating ad inventory — it’s turning everything into potential inventory. And Meta’s partnership with EssilorLuxottica (EL+1.01%) on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses gives it an AI-advantage that doesn’t threaten its business. Meanwhile, Google is struggling to integrate AI into its products without threatening its search business, Yu said, which “thrives on simplicity, directing users to click on links that generate ad revenue.” With AI chatbots that can provide direct answers to queries, users don’t have to visit web pages where ads are placed. And Google’s other AI features, such as NotebookLM, “don’t necessarily strengthen its primary revenue stream.” Meta was the third-highest tech company on the Center for Future Readiness’s Future Readiness Indicator after Nvidia (NVDA-1.18%) and Microsoft (MSFT-1.30%), due to its “aggressive investments in AI” that show “strong momentum, impacting nearly all aspects of its operations,” the report said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks. With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well. Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%. Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that "it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions." This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to "prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system." To prove that "equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth," the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that "market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House." The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor. The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns. Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank "urges caution" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets. Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.' Between then and now, the bank believes that "generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage." This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms "building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling." While generative AI might be in the "trough of disillusionment," the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the "overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions. Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software. However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market. According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is "more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud." This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank. Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver. Our Methodology To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 30% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world-leading GPU designer whose products are powering the artificial intelligence industry. Since the release of ChatGPT to the public, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have gained 730%, making it clear that AI is baked into the firm's hypothesis. The firm's fortunes depend on its ability to not only design the best-performing chips but also to sustainably and predictably ship them in high volumes to customers while keeping margins high. Consequently, any turbulence on either the product design, shipping, or cost control fronts leads to tailwinds for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares. Additionally, the high demand for its chips has meant that big tech is eager to find alternatives. The urgency for alternatives is also making companies design in-house AI chips, such as those from Amazon. As a result, unless NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) maintains its performance edge and logistics capabilities, the firm might see trouble in the future. Polen Capital mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: "In a reversal from the past two quarters, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market’s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock’s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (“GenAI”) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.” Overall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 20% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 219 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the leading social media company in the world. The firm operates through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and courtesy of Facebook, it can boast about having 3.2 billion users under its wing. These users also form the backbone of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s hypothesis as they allow the firm to have bargaining power with advertisers. Advertisement revenue is key for the firm as it accounted for 96% of its revenue during H1 2024. As a result, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) depends on broader economic health for its revenue as advertisers spend more in a robust economy. Its dominance in the social media industry has allowed the firm to establish a fortress balance sheet as is evident from $43.9 billion in cash. These resources, in turn, have enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to gain a strong foothold in the AI industry courtesy of its investment in training infrastructure and the Llama foundational AI model. As a result, the firm's hypothesis also depends on its ability to generate profit from its AI investments. On this front, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) offers AI marketing services to advertisers to streamline their operations. Polen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins.

Title: Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): Dominating Social Media and Venturing into AI with a Focus on Future Growth

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks. With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well. Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%. Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that "it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions." This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to "prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system." To prove that "equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth," the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that "market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House." The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor. The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns. Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank "urges caution" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets. Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.' Between then and now, the bank believes that "generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage." This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms "building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling." While generative AI might be in the "trough of disillusionment," the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the "overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions. Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software. However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market. According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is "more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud." This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank. Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver. Our Methodology To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 20% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 219 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the leading social media company in the world. The firm operates through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and courtesy of Facebook, it can boast about having 3.2 billion users under its wing. These users also form the backbone of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s hypothesis as they allow the firm to have bargaining power with advertisers. Advertisement revenue is key for the firm as it accounted for 96% of its revenue during H1 2024. As a result, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) depends on broader economic health for its revenue as advertisers spend more in a robust economy. Its dominance in the social media industry has allowed the firm to establish a fortress balance sheet as is evident from $43.9 billion in cash. These resources, in turn, have enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to gain a strong foothold in the AI industry courtesy of its investment in training infrastructure and the Llama foundational AI model. As a result, the firm's hypothesis also depends on its ability to generate profit from its AI investments. On this front, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) offers AI marketing services to advertisers to streamline their operations. Polen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.” Overall META ranks 11th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Envestnet Finalizes $4.5 Billion Go-Private Deal With Bain Capital

Wealth technology provider Envestnet has officially become a private company. The firm announced Monday (Nov. 25) that it had closed its acquisition by affiliates of vehicles managed or advised by Bain Capital, a deal worth roughly $4.5 billion. “This represents an exciting new chapter in Envestnet’s history, paving the way for accelerated growth and building on our position as a leading wealth management platform in the industry,” Jim Fox, Envestnet’s board chair and interim CEO, said in a news release. Added Tom Sipp, Envestnet’s executive vice president: “Together with Bain Capital, Envestnet will continue to deliver on its mission, empowering firms and advisors with the wealth technology and solutions to holistically serve their clients.” The company had announced its plans to go private in July. Also taking part in the deal were Reverence Capital and Norwest, along with BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, Franklin Templeton and State Street Global Advisors. According to the release, Envestnet has $6.5 trillion in platform assets, more than 20 million accounts and serves more than 111,000 financial advisors. The company’s technology, advanced insights and comprehensive solutions are designed to help financial advisors improve business growth, productivity and provide better client outcomes. In other news from the financial advice world, PYMNTS spoke last month with Doug Brown, chief product officer, digital banking at Candescent, about the pressures consumers feel in seeking such advice, with many plagued by a fear of missteps. “The best partner is in fact the local community bank who understands them and their environment better than most,” Brown told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. “There’s been a lot of outreach from both banks and others trying to inform, but what they’re probably doing is creating a little bit more panic than rational help. That’s why consumers are seeking a company they can trust to guide through this.” Credit unions and smaller banks “want to be top of mind with the small businesses and the consumers in the communities they serve,” Brown added. These financial institutions, which have existing relationships with consumers, should be natural financial advisors. But research by PYMNTS Intelligence and NCR Voyix (as Candescent was once known) found that only 57% of customers looked to their banks for financial advice last year. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

(see more details here). A group of finance professionals analyzing market trends on their computer screens. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 21% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY) is an enterprise-focused software company that provides human resource and financial management software. This exposes the firm to the labor market as HR software typically does well when firms have adequate hiring budgets in a relaxed monetary environment. Consequently, with interest rates in the US just recently coming off of a 24-year high, it's unsurprising that Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY)'s shares are down 4% year-to-date. However, the pent-up potential in the stock due to monetary constraints is also evident through the fact that since the November presidential election, the shares have gained 6.70%. Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY) has struggled particularly hard due to increasing costs as it posted operating losses each year between 2021 and 2023. However, improved financial performance can carry significant tailwinds, as was evident following Q2 results when the stock jumped by 12.5% after Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY)'s $2.085 billion revenue and $1.75 in EPS beat analyst estimates of $2.071 billion and $1.65. Polen Capital mentioned Workday Inc. (NYSE:WDAY) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: "We added to several existing positions in the quarter including Adobe, Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY), Shopify, MSCI, and Paycom Software. Workday is still growing revenue at a mid-to-high-teens rate, but in recent years, slower macroeconomic growth has made closing deals more challenging. Amidst a pullback, we increased our position as we found the valuation attractive for a well-positioned, recurring revenue business with still strong growth potential. The company also recently stated publicly that it will be focused on expanding profit margins meaningfully over the next five years—something we have expected and are pleased to see.” Overall WDAY ranks 10th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of WDAY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than WDAY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In other recent news, Axon Enterprise Inc. reported a strong third-quarter performance, marked by record bookings and significant revenue growth. The company's revenue in Q3 increased by 32% year-over-year, and the adjusted EBITDA margin reached 26.7%. Axon's focus on innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and TASER products, has been a key driver of this success. The company's recent acquisition, Dedrone, has been fully integrated, and the launch of new AI-driven products is underway. These developments have led Axon to raise its Q4 revenue guidance to $560-570 million and project a full-year revenue exceeding $2.07 billion. Despite some sequential margin decline expected in Q4 due to integration costs, Axon maintains a confident outlook. The company anticipates maintaining a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin by 2025 and is on track to meet its 2025 revenue target one year early.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Talks Up Cooperation With China Ahead of Trump Trade War 2.0

Despite widespread fears that President-elect Donald Trump’s return to office will lead to tightened trade policies around A.I. chips to curb China’s tech advances, the CEO of Nvidia (NVDA), the largest manufacturer of A.I. chips, is still optimistic about the state of America’s relationship with China under the incoming administration. “Open research is one of the miracles of modern science and perhaps the ultimate form of global cooperation—one that we must protect,” Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang on Saturday (Nov. 23) while accepting an honorary doctorate from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Huang, who lauded the region’s contributions towards technology like A.I., later told reporters that, while he doesn’t “know what’s going to happen with the new administration,” Nvidia will continue to balance policy and law compliance with innovative tech development.

You can opt out anytime. Nvidia’s booming GPU business has made it one of the world’s most valuable public companies, with a market cap of $3.38 trillion. However, like other chipmakers, its footprint in China has been shrinking in recent years amid growing geopolitical tensions and tightened export policies. Nvidia’s sales in China accounted for around 15 percent of its total revenue in the quarter ended September, a drop from 26 percent two years ago. In a continued effort under Trump’s first presidential term, the Biden administration in 2022 restricted Nvidia from selling its most advanced chips to China (including Hong Kong). Trump, who is poised to expand such measures, has also said he will enact tariffs in Taiwan, home to Nvidia’s largest supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). While supporting measured China policies, Huang lauded China’s “significant contributions to open science research helping to advance A.I. worldwide.” Over the years, Nvidia has benefitted from its presence in areas like Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, according to the CEO. “From the beginning, we’ve had the benefit and the great joy and privilege of watching the amazing tech industry form in China,” he said. As Huang received his honorary doctorate from HKUST, he highlighted the fact that the school’s alumni have helped found more than 1,800 startups that are still in operation today. “I’m thrilled to see so much energy focused on advancing the science of A.I. as well as using A.I. to advance at HKUST and across all of China,” he said. Thanks to developments across the new technology, “the greatest challenges of our time—unimaginable challenges to overcome in the past—all of a sudden seem possible to tackle,” he added. Earlier this month, Huang said that Nvidia will comply with whichever policies the Trump administration decides upon. “We’ll of course support the administration,” said Huang during an earnings call, adding Nvidia will also simultaneously continue to support its customers and compete in the marketplace.

Title: Wall Street launches new ways to bet on bitcoin

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time For years, bitcoin won by being boring. Investors weren’t able to do all that much with it besides buy and hold it. But that was precisely why the world’s largest cryptocurrency was valuable. It was a commodity, like gold — or corn. It didn’t get too fancy on its offerings. In fact, bitcoin’s core team of developers has intentionally moved as slowly as possible on everything that touches the base blockchain specifically to avoid breaking things. That’s why many of crypto’s more cavalier coders headed to other blockchains to tinker and do things like build decentralized applications. The approach worked. Traders poured their money into bitcoin not just because it was the OG coin but also because the network was robust and reliable, and they knew what they were getting. As solana reported hack after hack, bitcoin didn’t really change. The asset was volatile, but aside from a major system upgrade that took four years to design and green-light, bitcoin kept its status as the world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market cap by sticking to the status quo. But times are changing for the original coin. Developers are increasingly building on bitcoin’s base blockchain in unexpected ways. Wall Street is also decking the coin out with all its familiar trappings such as exchange-traded fund wrappers and allowing traders to hedge positions and make leveraged bets. In January, spot bitcoin ETFs began trading, which opened the door to more mainstream investors. Last week, options on those spot crypto products finally started to go live on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange. CBOE Global Markets is also set to list its first cash-settled bitcoin ETF options Dec. 2. Creating this new margin framework around bitcoin means that both retail traders and institutions alike will be able to get more exposure to the asset class relative to how much cash they’re investing. Collectively, the U.S.-issued spot bitcoin funds hold north of $100 billion in assets under management. Last week, they notched their largest weekly inflows on record, totaling more than $3.1 billion. And according to CoinShares, year-to-date net flows are up to $37 billion versus U.S. Gold ETFs, which drew around $309 million in their first year. Nearly half of those flows into the spot bitcoin products took place after U.S. interest rates were cut for the first time in four years in September. Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, told CNBC there has been record high open interest for futures on the CME derivatives exchange, the way most U.S. institutions currently buy bitcoin futures contracts. But a lot of traders have been waiting for options on spot bitcoin ETFs on major exchanges such as the NYSE and Nasdaq, since it enhances liquidity and offers hedging tools. Lunde says that demand for leveraged long exposure to bitcoin and ether is climbing, with VolatilityShares’ BTC exposure hitting new all-time highs. Galaxy Digital’s trading team told CNBC the firm has observed significant volume in BlackRock’s IBIT ETF options, the first to launch on the Nasdaq last week. BlackRock is the largest digital asset manager in the world after it eclipsed Grayscale in August. BlackRock’s bitcoin trust IBIT holds $48.4 billion in bitcoin compared with the $34 billion in its gold trust. Options on IBIT had a blockbuster debut, with 353,716 contracts traded on its first day, according to Galaxy Digital. The firm noted that the previous most active debut of options trading was when Facebook options went live in 2012 and 360,000 contracts changed hands. Galaxy sees notable trading activity extending out to January 2027, roughly halfway into Donald Trump’s administration. On the campaign trail, the president-elect had an about-face on bitcoin and went from criticizing digital assets to making big promises to the crypto industry. Bitcoin is up roughly 40% since Election Day, Nov. 5. “This level of concentrated, long-dated activity reflects investor confidence in the ETF’s long-term growth potential, signaling bullish sentiment for the years ahead,” Galaxy’s trading team told CNBC. Until now, offshore crypto native platforms such as Binance and Deribit have been the main marketplace for bitcoin derivatives trading. Galaxy told CNBC there is a noticeable volatility premium between Deribit, CME and IBIT, which could present arbitrage opportunities among the varying platforms offering derivatives trading. On Friday, more than $9 billion in bitcoin options contracts expire on Deribit, which could lead to greater price volatility as the expiration date approaches. “There’s a ton of leverage in the system right now,” Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, a longtime crypto investor, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Friday. “You look at the funding rates to do crypto in our market, right? The perpetual market, as high as they’ve been, the basis is high,” Novogratz said. “The crypto community is levered to the gills, and so there will be a correction.” Bitcoin was within striking distance of $100,000 on Friday but retrenched over the weekend. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $95,000. MacKenzie Sigalos is a technology reporter for CNBC with a focus on cryptocurrency and fintech. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks rose on Monday as small caps rallied near new highs and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 400 points amid a broad sense of optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary. The Dow increased 0.9% to close at a new record. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.3%, despite Nvidia (NVDA) sliding over 4%. The Russell 2000 (^RUT), up 1.6%, also closed a whisker off a record high. It did notch an intraday high. Stocks kicked off a holiday-shortened week with more of the upbeat mood that lifted the gauges to weekly wins. Markets will shut on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and close early on Friday. Trump tapped Bessent, viewed as the "investor favorite" pick for Treasury, late Friday evening after a surprisingly drawn-out process that saw candidates' stocks seem to rise and fall by the day. Bessent's nomination has seemed to at least temporarily calm nerves over the president-elect's inflationary agenda, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dipping back under 4.3%. On the inflationary front, the Fed will get its preferred look at the picture heading into Trump's term with Wednesday's release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. Economists expect a tick up in "core" PCE, which is closely watched by the central bank. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) was in search of a milestone $100,000-per-coin level amid a near-50% surge over the past month. It was back down below $95,000 on Monday, however. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Stocks rose on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closing at a fresh record after gaining more than 400 points, or nearly 1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also gained 0.3%, weighed by shares of Nvidia (NVDA) sliding over 4%. Meanwhile small cap stocks also rallied with the Russell 2000 (^RUT) gaining as much as 2% during the session to hit record intraday highs. The index closed just shy of its all-time high record. The markets rose on Monday following President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Kamlani reports: Allurion (ALUR) launched a new program to provide patients access to compounded weight-loss drugs Monday after months of pitching its own weight-loss solution — an ingestible balloon — as an alternative for patients who may not want to use the popular injectable GLP-1 drugs. Allurion CEO Shantanu Gaur told Yahoo Finance that, like others, the company continues to see a spillover effect from the unprecedented interest in GLP-1 drugs like Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Zepbound. It's why the company is now offering copycat products at a fraction of the cost. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Tesla stock (TSLA) is down Monday following a strong recent run-up as one Wall Street bank says “animal spirits” have pushed the stock beyond any “fundamental change” at the company. Joseph Spak at UBS noted that Tesla stock has surged around 40% since the election, adding over $350 million to its market cap. While some of President-elect Donald Trump's policy proposals could favor Tesla, there are some policy negatives as well that would hurt fundamentals more than where the theoretical upside has taken the stock. “The rise in Tesla stock is mostly driven by animal spirits/momentum (which has happened multiple times in TSLA’s history),” Spak wrote. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) sank on Monday to $95,000 after recently jumping to record highs just a stone's throw away from $100,000. The cryptocurrency has been on a steady climb since the Donald Trump's presidential victory earlier this month. On Friday the token inched above $99,600. Year-to-date bitcoin is up about 120%. Cruise line stocks have had an impressive run this year, and there’s still more room for growth, according to Bank of America. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH) and Carnival Corporation (CCL) have climbed more than 30% while Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) is up over 80% year-to-date. Bank of America raised Norwegian's price target to $29 from $26 and kept a Neutral rating. For Carnival, the firm raised the price target to $28 from $24 and kept a Buy rating, while for Royal Caribbean, analysts raised the price target to $240 from $210 and kept a Neutral rating. “The travel industry is back,” Bank of America analyst Andrew Didora told Yahoo Finance. “It just seems like the core demographic here for cruise [lines], which is typically a bit higher income, they continue to be in a good spot from a discretionary spending perspective.” Cruise-line operators have seen a resurgence in demand as interest rebounded from the pandemic-era, when the restrictions kept fleets docked. Data from Bank of America shows that monthly cruise spending increased 8% in October on a yearly basis. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped to session lows, sinking more than 3% on Monday. The AI chip heavyweight was the worst performer among the 'Magnificent 7' stocks. Tesla (TSLA) shares fell more than 1% while Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) rose more than 1%. Nvidia's slide weighed on the Nasdaq, which briefly turned negative by 12:20 p.m. ET. Netflix (NFLX) shares also slid 3%, keeping a lid on the tech-heavy index. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) rose more than 2% on Monday to hit its highest level since November 2021. The small cap index has rallied in recent months as the Fed began its interest rate cutting cycle, fueling expectations of less expensive financing. The Russell 2000 is up more than 20% year-to-date, with much of those gains occurring since early August. Two more Wall Street strategists are projecting the bull market in US stocks will roll on in 2025. On Monday, equity strategy teams at Barclays and RBC Capital Markets both issued a year-end target price of 6,600 for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 2025. The targets suggest a roughly 10.5% gain in the benchmark index over the next twelve months, about in line with the long-term historical average annual return over the past century. "The story the data tells us is that another year of solid economic and earnings growth, some political tailwinds, and some additional relief on inflation (which should keep the S&P 500’s P/E elevated) can keep stocks moving higher in the year ahead," RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, wrote that with "inflation continuing to normalize, resilient macro, and Big Tech maintaining EPS growth leadership," the S&P 500 should continue its march higher.

MicroStrategy stock recovered from a loss of more than 7% in early trading. In a filing with the SEC, MicroStrategy said it spent $5.4 billion to acquire these bitcoin between Nov. 18-24, buying the bitcoin at an average price of $97,862. The company said it used proceeds from convertible notes and share sales to fund the purchase. The application software company, which has become a bitcoin proxy, has been buying tokens since 2020. In recent weeks, it has intensified its purchases as bitcoin has rallied to highs above $99,000 following Donald Trump's presidential win earlier this month. As of Sunday, MicroStrategy held a total of approximately 386,700 bitcoins, acquired for an aggregate purchase price of about $21.9 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $56,761 per bitcoin. Oil dropped to session lows on a report that a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah may have been reached. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) sank more than 2% to hover below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded below $74 per barrel. Axios reported on Monday that Israel and Lebanon have agreed to terms of a ceasefire, citing a senior US official. Earlier, the Israeli ambassador to Washington said in a radio interview on Monday that deal points still need to be finalized but an agreement "can happen within days.” Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped as much as 3% in early trading as the AI chip heavyweight failed to participate in the rest of the market gains. Nvidia shares extended their decline from Friday's session, despite the company beating on quarterly results announced last week. The AI chipmaker has been a leader in the overall markets this year, accounting for roughly 20% of the S&P 500's performance. US stocks rose on Monday as investors await the Fed's preferred measure of inflation this week and after President-elect Donald Trump announced his pick for Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the advance, up roughly 0.7%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while those the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up almost 0.6%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index will be released this Wednesday, giving investors clues on what the Fed's next move with interest rates may be.

Cruise line stocks have had an impressive run this year, and there’s still more room for growth, according to Bank of America. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH) and Carnival Corporation (CCL) have climbed more than 30% while Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) is up over 80% year-to-date. Bank of America raised Norwegian's price target to $29 from $26 and kept a Neutral rating. For Carnival, the firm raised the price target to $28 from $24 and kept a Buy rating, while for Royal Caribbean, analysts raised the price target to $240 from $210 and kept a Neutral rating. “The travel industry is back,” Bank of America analyst Andrew Didora told Yahoo Finance. “It just seems like the core demographic here for cruise [lines], which is typically a bit higher income, they continue to be in a good spot from a discretionary spending perspective.” Cruise-line operators have seen a resurgence in demand as interest rebounded from the pandemic-era, when the restrictions kept fleets docked. Data from Bank of America shows that monthly cruise spending increased 8% in October on a yearly basis. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped to session lows, sinking more than 3% on Monday. The AI chip heavyweight was the worst performer among the 'Magnificent 7' stocks. Tesla (TSLA) shares fell more than 1% while Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) rose more than 1%. Nvidia's slide weighed on the Nasdaq, which briefly turned negative by 12:20 p.m. ET. Netflix (NFLX) shares also slid 3%, keeping a lid on the tech-heavy index. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) rose more than 2% on Monday to hit its highest level since November 2021. The small cap index has rallied in recent months as the Fed began its interest rate cutting cycle, fueling expectations of less expensive financing. The Russell 2000 is up more than 20% year-to-date, with much of those gains occurring since early August. Two more Wall Street strategists are projecting the bull market in US stocks will roll on in 2025. On Monday, equity strategy teams at Barclays and RBC Capital Markets both issued a year-end target price of 6,600 for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 2025. The targets suggest a roughly 10.5% gain in the benchmark index over the next twelve months, about in line with the long-term historical average annual return over the past century. "The story the data tells us is that another year of solid economic and earnings growth, some political tailwinds, and some additional relief on inflation (which should keep the S&P 500’s P/E elevated) can keep stocks moving higher in the year ahead," RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, wrote that with "inflation continuing to normalize, resilient macro, and Big Tech maintaining EPS growth leadership," the S&P 500 should continue its march higher.

MicroStrategy stock recovered from a loss of more than 7% in early trading. In a filing with the SEC, MicroStrategy said it spent $5.4 billion to acquire these bitcoin between Nov. 18-24, buying the bitcoin at an average price of $97,862. The company said it used proceeds from convertible notes and share sales to fund the purchase. The application software company, which has become a bitcoin proxy, has been buying tokens since 2020. In recent weeks, it has intensified its purchases as bitcoin has rallied to highs above $99,000 following Donald Trump's presidential win earlier this month. As of Sunday, MicroStrategy held a total of approximately 386,700 bitcoins, acquired for an aggregate purchase price of about $21.9 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $56,761 per bitcoin. Oil dropped to session lows on a report that a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah may have been reached. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) sank more than 2% to hover below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded below $74 per barrel. Axios reported on Monday that Israel and Lebanon have agreed to terms of a ceasefire, citing a senior US official. Earlier, the Israeli ambassador to Washington said in a radio interview on Monday that deal points still need to be finalized but an agreement "can happen within days.” Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped as much as 3% in early trading as the AI chip heavyweight failed to participate in the rest of the market gains. Nvidia shares extended their decline from Friday's session, despite the company beating on quarterly results announced last week. The AI chipmaker has been a leader in the overall markets this year, accounting for roughly 20% of the S&P 500's performance. US stocks rose on Monday as investors await the Fed's preferred measure of inflation this week and after President-elect Donald Trump announced his pick for Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the advance, up roughly 0.7%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while those the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up almost 0.6%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index will be released this Wednesday, giving investors clues on what the Fed's next move with interest rates may be. The "Magnificent Seven" stocks were mostly higher, with the exception of Nvidia (NVDA), down more than 1%, extending its declines Economic data: Dallas Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Bath & Body Works (BBWI), Zoom (ZM), Macy's (M) (preliminary) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed over the weekend and early this morning: Fed-favored PCE inflation seen as stalling: The week ahead Trump's Treasury choice Bessent says tax cuts are a priority Macy's delays Q3 report on accounting issue, stock falls Tesla's $350B surge driven by hype, not fundamentals: UBS YF columnist Rick Newman: The Republican economy takes off Trump trade muddles inflation outlook in Fed's favorite gauge Nvidia CEO says global cooperation in tech will continue under Trump administration Black Friday Can’t Come Soon Enough for Retailers Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (ORLY): Resilient Growth Amid Consumer Challenges and Counter-Cyclical Strengths

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks. With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well. Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%. Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that "it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions." This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to "prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system." To prove that "equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth," the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that "market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House." The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor. The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns. Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank "urges caution" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets. Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.' Between then and now, the bank believes that "generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage." This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms "building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling." While generative AI might be in the "trough of disillusionment," the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the "overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions. Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software. However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market. According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is "more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud." This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank. Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver. Our Methodology To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A mechanic working on a car in an auto shop, skillfully replacing the aftermarket parts. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 12% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52 O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) is an American car parts retailer headquartered in Missouri. The firm sells new and refurbished parts through its stores. It's another stock that has been hit hard by the weak consumer spending environment in the US. Ahead of the November election, O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY)'s shares had gained a modest 23% as consumer demand has remained muted. However, the firm benefits from a diversified income statement that depends on consumers and repair shops. The latter business has helped O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) avoid a sharper stock price downturn. This is because during H1 2024, while the firm's consumer revenue grew by 2.5%, the revenue from parts sold to shops grew by 8.5%. Additionally, there might be pent-up potential built up in the stock that can be released due to robust economic activity. This potential was hinted at when O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY)'s shares gained 6% after the election and are up by 4.3% since then. ClearBridge Investments mentioned O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Skepticism over the consumer has left some high-quality stocks with depressed valuations and allowed us to reduce our consumer discretionary underweight with the addition of O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) and Starbucks. While we have been cautious on retailers for quite some time, auto parts retailer O’Reilly is a best-in-class, high-quality operator with high returns on invested capital and a solid history of consistent execution and sustainable share gain, and it enjoys rational competitive dynamics in the broader industry. In addition, auto parts retailing carries some counter-cyclicality as consumers tend to hold on to their cars longer, requiring more repair and maintenance, during softer economic environments. We think a high-quality franchise like O’Reilly trading at a reasonable valuation in an otherwise expensive market is worth our attention and we initiated a starter position.” Overall ORLY ranks 22nd on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of ORLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ORLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A smiling person in sports gear testing out a piece of new fitness equipment. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 12% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34 Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) is a fitness center operator that operates through franchises and equipment sales. The firm's self-owned stores which it operates under the Planet Fitness brand are its largest source of revenue. These stores accounted for 45% of Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT)'s revenue during H1 2024, and they were followed by franchise revenue which accounted for 31% of the firm's sales. Consequently, consumer spending on fitness and Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT)'s ability to increase its memberships along with stable operations are the keys to the firm's hypothesis. The firm also depends on the ability to open new stores, which has been constrained lately due to the slowdown in the real estate industry because of high interest rates. Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) is currently seeking to grow revenue by increasing its Classic membership fees, as it hopes to attract more consumers after witnessing growth in the premium Black membership segment. Consequently, membership growth and store expansion can lead to tailwinds or headwinds for the shares. During the Q3 2024 earnings call, Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT)'s management shared how retail store closures can play into its store expansion plans. Here is what they said: "We – I read a recent study that said there were about 5,300 closures last year and there will be north of 6,000 closures this year. And we do see that as an opportunity for Planet Fitness and to work in partnership with our franchisees. Our real estate team is engaged with brokers on a very regular basis to have line of sight to where space maybe becoming available and then partnering with our franchisees on that availability where there’s an opportunity to develop a new club. So I think you’re spot on. And we’re seeing the same trends. We know that’s market specific. It’s not in every market, but there’s a lot of space coming online. Overall PLNT ranks 23rd on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of PLNT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLNT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Microsoft's Death Cross: Tech Giant Faces A Double Blow With FTC Pressure

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), the heavyweight of Big Tech, has hit a grim milestone in technical analysis: a Death Cross. With its share price slipping below key moving averages, MSFT stock has moved into bearish territory, casting doubts on its near-term prospects. Is this just a blip for the software giant, or the prelude to deeper woes? Chart created using Benzinga Pro At $418.19, MSFT stock price trails its 20-day, 50-day and even the 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs). Technical indicators are sounding alarms: The 20-day SMA at $418.73, the 50-day SMA at $421.65 and the 200-day SMA at $421.81 all point to a bearish signal. The eight-day SMA at $417.37, continues to be driven by bullish sentiment over the short term, driven by buying pressure. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) stands at -1.11, another red flag. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 49.09 suggests that Microsoft isn't oversold yet but is heading toward bearish momentum. These technical markers paint a strongly bearish picture. Yet, buying pressure persists, indicating that investors still see potential for a turnaround—a glimmer of bullish hope amidst the gloom. Read Also: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. Compounding Microsoft's technical woes is a ProPublica investigation that has raised ethical and legal concerns over the company’s federal contracting practices. As detailed in the report, Microsoft's "White House Offer"—a supposedly altruistic pledge to bolster government cybersecurity—was a calculated business maneuver. The plan involved providing free upgrades and consulting services to federal agencies, locking them into Microsoft's ecosystem. Once the "free" period ended, agencies had little choice but to continue with costly subscriptions and Azure services, effectively squeezing out competitors. This strategy not only strengthened Microsoft's grip on federal business but also invited scrutiny for potentially violating federal procurement and antitrust laws. Legal experts argue that the deal sidesteps open competition, raising concerns about its long-term implications for government reliance on a single vendor. While the technical indicators signal bearishness, the buying pressure suggests a tug-of-war between short-term skepticism and long-term optimism. Microsoft's market dominance—bolstered by its lucrative cloud business and strategic maneuvers—remains a formidable moat. However, the ethical controversies surrounding its federal contracts could dent investor confidence and invite regulatory headwinds. Microsoft's Death Cross is a wake-up call for investors. With the stock under technical pressure and the ProPublica revelations casting a shadow over its business practices, the path forward is murky. Bulls might see this as a chance to buy on weakness, banking on Microsoft's resilience. Bears, however, have a compelling case to remain cautious as the stock navigates this precarious juncture. For now, Microsoft's crossroads is a reminder that even the mightiest of tech giants are not immune to scrutiny—or the market's harsh judgment.

Investors weren't able to do all that much with it besides buy and hold it. But that was precisely why the world's largest cryptocurrency was valuable. It was a commodity, like gold — or corn. It didn't get too fancy on its offerings. In fact, bitcoin's core team of developers has intentionally moved as slowly as possible on everything that touches the base blockchain specifically to avoid breaking things. That's why many of crypto's more cavalier coders headed to other blockchains to tinker and do things like build decentralized applications. The approach worked. Traders poured their money into bitcoin not just because it was the OG coin but also because the network was robust and reliable, and they knew what they were getting. As solana reported hack after hack, bitcoin didn't really change. The asset was volatile, but aside from a major system upgrade that took four years to design and green-light, bitcoin kept its status as the world's biggest cryptocurrency by market cap by sticking to the status quo. But times are changing for the original coin. Developers are increasingly building on bitcoin's base blockchain in unexpected ways. Wall Street is also decking the coin out with all its familiar trappings such as exchange-traded fund wrappers and allowing traders to hedge positions and make leveraged bets. In January, spot bitcoin ETFs began trading, which opened the door to more mainstream investors. Last week, options on those spot crypto products finally started to go live on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange. CBOE Global Markets is also set to list its first cash-settled bitcoin ETF options Dec. 2. Creating this new margin framework around bitcoin means that both retail traders and institutions alike will be able to get more exposure to the asset class relative to how much cash they're investing. Collectively, the U.S.-issued spot bitcoin funds hold north of $100 billion in assets under management. Last week, they notched their largest weekly inflows on record, totaling more than $3.1 billion. And according to CoinShares, year-to-date net flows are up to $37 billion versus U.S. Gold ETFs, which drew around $309 million in their first year. Nearly half of those flows into the spot bitcoin products took place after U.S. interest rates were cut for the first time in four years in September. Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, told CNBC there has been record high open interest for futures on the CME derivatives exchange, the way most U.S. institutions currently buy bitcoin futures contracts. But a lot of traders have been waiting for options on spot bitcoin ETFs on major exchanges such as the NYSE and Nasdaq, since it enhances liquidity and offers hedging tools. Lunde says that demand for leveraged long exposure to bitcoin and ether is climbing, with VolatilityShares' BTC exposure hitting new all-time highs. Galaxy Digital's trading team told CNBC the firm has observed significant volume in BlackRock's IBIT ETF options, the first to launch on the Nasdaq last week. BlackRock is the largest digital asset manager in the world after it eclipsed Grayscale in August. BlackRock's bitcoin trust IBIT holds $48.4 billion in bitcoin compared with the $34 billion in its gold trust. Options on IBIT had a blockbuster debut, with 353,716 contracts traded on its first day, according to Galaxy Digital. The firm noted that the previous most active debut of options trading was when Facebook options went live in 2012 and 360,000 contracts changed hands. Galaxy sees notable trading activity extending out to January 2027, roughly halfway into Donald Trump's administration. On the campaign trail, the president-elect had an about-face on bitcoin and went from criticizing digital assets to making big promises to the crypto industry. Bitcoin is up roughly 40% since Election Day, Nov. 5. "This level of concentrated, long-dated activity reflects investor confidence in the ETF's long-term growth potential, signaling bullish sentiment for the years ahead," Galaxy's trading team told CNBC. Until now, offshore crypto native platforms such as Binance and Deribit have been the main marketplace for bitcoin derivatives trading. Galaxy told CNBC there is a noticeable volatility premium between Deribit, CME and IBIT, which could present arbitrage opportunities among the varying platforms offering derivatives trading. On Friday, more than $9 billion in bitcoin options contracts expire on Deribit, which could lead to greater price volatility as the expiration date approaches. "There's a ton of leverage in the system right now," Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, a longtime crypto investor, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Friday. "You look at the funding rates to do crypto in our market, right? The perpetual market, as high as they've been, the basis is high," Novogratz said. "The crypto community is levered to the gills, and so there will be a correction." Bitcoin was within striking distance of $100,000 on Friday but retrenched over the weekend. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $95,000. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: These Are The Best Black Friday New-Vehicle Rebate And Financing Deals

Time Published: 2024-11-25T19:35:45Z
Full Content:
The full-electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck is being offered with up to $5,000 cash back and ... [+] with a free home changing unit and installation. Though it originated with fighting crowds swarming to score deep discounts on big-screen TVs and the latest must-have toys, the so-called Black Friday weekend has since become one of the best times of the year to buy a new car, with automakers kicking off their annual holiday savings events. The deals look to be especially rich and plentiful this time around, especially for those willing to take their pick of leftover cars and trucks from the 2024 model year. Many of them are carrying especially lucrative cash-back and zero-percent financing incentives from the manufacturers to help dealers winnow down their existing stock. We’re listing the best deals we could find below. Many of the richest rebate offers are on electric vehicles from the 2024 model year that remain in stock, with several automakers offering $7,500 cash back to compensate on models that do not otherwise qualify for the one-time $7,500 federal tax credit. Of note, Ford is currently offering a complimentary home charger and installation, in addition to the incentives listed below, on the F-150 Lightning full-size electric pickup truck and the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV. We’re noting the vehicles offering cash rebates of $3,000 or more and/or 0.0% financing through automakers’ captive finance divisions for four-year or longer terms; several other models are likewise offering 0.0% loans, but only for three-year loan lengths. Always run the numbers when facing a choice between a cash rebate and cut-rate financing, relative to the lowest new-car loan rates from local lenders or your credit union, to see which is the better deal. Some automakers’ offers are regional in nature, usually to address local supply and demand issues. For example, we found a $10,000 cash rebate on the full-size Lincoln Navigator SUV being promoted in the Southern California area. The terms we’re quoting below are those being extended nationwide or at least in various regions as far as we can tell, and are valid through Thanksgiving weekend. Note that cut-rate financing programs are generally restricted to those having stellar credit scores and qualifying incomes. Expect local dealerships to get in the act with their own Black Friday promotions to help lure consumers already in a spending mood into their showrooms. However, expect the most generous incentives and/or deepest discounts to be limited to the slowest sellers on the lot, and especially on any remaining 2024 model-year inventory, while current models may offer less-generous deals, if at all. Note that other cash rebates or financing incentives may be available to recent college graduates, first responders, members of the military and other groups; some are offered to current brand owners or those from competing automakers; others are sometimes extended to those having qualifying trade-ins. Check contact automakers’ websites or area dealerships for details on what’s being offered locally. As always, keep in mind that cash rebates come directly from the automaker. For their part, dealers should also be willing to slash their markups to help clear their existing inventories on any of the models we’re highlighting These are often enabled with the assistance of what are often called “secret rebates” made direct to dealerships. Be sure to negotiate the transaction price separately from any cash rebate that may apply and shop around for the best bottom-line deal. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: BIG BIT THOUGHTS.

Time Published: 2024-11-25T19:27:51Z

Video podcast Audio I don’t think I know any human being on the planet who doesn’t want to be rich, or tries to increase their worth their net worth etc. Doesn’t matter if you’re an investor, work for a charity, a church etc. Money and capital are critical, it is like our economic life blood. For example, maybe you should think about blood. Blood is a critical and essential. Nobody could survive or thrive without blood. Now imagine… That somebody is taking your help four-year-old child, in drawing a pint of blood from them a day. What is going to happen to the health of your kid? It will severely stunt his growth, or positively kill him. Another thing… Imagine like you’re eating only rancid food your whole life, and the theory, you’re not going to die from it, but… Ain’t nobody want to eat rancid food. Or, let us assume that you’re consuming certain foods to just keep you alive, like beans, but everyone knows that beans cause flatulence, even an ancient Roman times, and technically raw beans are toxic. Lagoons, naturally do not want to be eaten or consumed. And therefore the toxic shell membrane they create is probably to ward off predators. ￼ And we clever humans, devised of ingenious ways to boil the shit out of them, just simply make them edible and not kill us. And the truth is, if you only ate beans you would not die, but… If you want to be the most demigod of them all, obviously you’re not going to be some sort of poverty person just consuming beans for some sort of strange higher altruistic purpose? Instead, you feast on the finest the bone marrow, the finest lamb ribs, just think about the hut of Achilles, what did he eat, and feed his guests? You know how they talk about life before Jesus life after Jesus, BC and AD… I am quite certain that a similar concept will happen with Satoshi. Like before Satoshi, life BS (before Satoshi, haha sounds like BS), and life AFTER Satoshi (AS). ￼ so the issue with being a modern day human or even American is that so much of the economic policies are obfuscated from the general public. For example. When I was in Saigon, in Vietnam off the grid, I had some time to critically think about economic theory and the like, to really try to critically understand on how currency is printed, made dominant around the planet, supported by US military force etc. In fact, if you think about the whole American the US military complex, it is basically focused on pumping money into the military industry, in order to assert military dominance on the planet, so all the weaker nations will have to force to use our dollars and accept and use our dollars, And also… America being able to pile on infinite debt obligations, knowing that she never intends to pay any of it back. So if we think about that, we know about debt in context of just being a normal human being, we don’t really know and understand debt in terms of an American national policy. For example, as a human being there’s a certain point in which numbers don’t really mean anything anymore. For example, I told you that the American national debt was 900 trillion, 45 trillion, $10 trillion, $18.3 trillion, would you be able to really understand or grasp this? Of course no! We daily humans, assume that you’re making like I don’t know 40,000 60,000, $80,000 a year… Which means maybe let us say that after taxes you’re pulling in like five to $6000 a month. If this is the case, the law of large numbers; at a certain point certain numbers don’t really mean anything to us, nor are they connected to reality. For example, the average American has never seen $1 million in their checking account or their bank balance, let alone 10 million, 100 million, 1 billion, 10 billion, 100 billion etc. ￼ There is a certain point in which numbers, ones and zeros, don’t really register in our brains. I always make the joke that I’m an Asian who is really really bad at math. And even now I am. And ironically enough, out of all my friends or typical normal human beings I know, besides Elon Musk and Michael Saylor, I am like by far the most successful innovator entrepreneur and investor of all time. I know no other human in the flesh who has stacked as many bitcoins as I have, and pretty much for the most part I never had to ever or I never panic sold any of my bitcoin. Besides selling some bitcoin like three years ago to just max out my Roth IRA contribution for the year, which ultimately I guess was a good idea because that money went into microstrategy MSTR, which is growing at an alarming rate, ￼– fortunately I had the wisdom of Odysseus; covering my ears and eyes with digital beeswax. ￼ About it, in hindsight, maybe one of the most interesting things I did was quit email in the year 2017. I might check my email like every six months or so for like authentication codes to sign into random portals, but besides this, I no longer really use email as a form of communication. If I’m doing like a workshop and I need to communicate some sort of critical information, ￼ then I’ll just copy and paste a bunch of emails, linked to Google sheets or something to send out a Zoom link or something. But besides this, email is really kind of a not good form of communication. Let us consider, i’m almost starting to feel like sending emails like sending a fax in the year 2024. I actually find it 1 trillion times more better to just FaceTime people as needed, — just think about it… All these sci-fi movies in the past, when they communicate with some sort of computer or AI, how do they do it? When you’re chatting with Jarvis it is all just a voice, and then you do the 3-D hologram thing with your hands like Tony Stark. Or if you’re Tony Stark in the Iron Man suit, what do you do? You talk to Jarvis naturally, when Jarvis is inside your helmet. In fact, I believe that the original Iron Man might be one of the best films of all time, I intend on watching it again. Anyways, once again, there is no exciting movie which is actually about somebody taking out a phone like an iPhone and either sending you a text message quietly, and or, sending a long tedious email? This will not make a fun movie. Anyways, as a consequence, I think the best concept is thinking about information information flows more critically, harder stronger faster. But knowing how to filter it. The first idea is Twitter and X. It might be the world‘s newest most valuable and only useful social media platform, now that Elon Musk runs the show, and I’m like 1000% Elon, it is really truly the best and only place to get critical information about financial news etc. My thought is traditional news outlets will die a slow gradual death, just like blockbuster. It’s funny, because I remember when I was in college, and I already saw my roommate Kevin ordering Netflix DVDs in the mail, which at the time I thought was very bizarre, but I knew that blockbuster was on the way out. I wanted to short blockbuster, but eventually did not because I just didn’t know how to do it, even now I’m not quite sure how to short a stock, it just seems too complicated. ERIC Semmler, one of the head honchos at semler scientific, is also on the bitcoin standard, using bitcoin yield, BTC yield as a measure of positive performance. Funny enough he also shares my name. Anyways, I listen to an interview between him and Natalie Brunel, and something was interesting was ERIC who has been in the game for a long time, the century said that shorting stocks is actually really really difficult and very rarely profitable. Rather a lot better to instead, to just go along in a positive way for a stock. And also I agree from a philosophical perspective, voting on the success of something, and voting on the success of a stocking company, to me almost morally an ethically feels superior; the reason being is that it just feels more positive and constructive. And also it might be more profitable? Investing in bitcoin is kinda good for everybody, even if you’re like kind of anti-establishment, anti-capitalism… Bitcoin is a positively good thing. Why? If you invest in bitcoin and you purchase bitcoin, and you put yourself in your family on a bitcoin standard, the upside and positivity is that You are essentially giving a middle finger to the establishment, the “man”. For example, anybody who is a non-conformist, punk rock, into rapper hip-hop culture whatever… Steve Jobs follower, etc., should be for bitcoin. Why? Because once again, it is anti-mainstream! Even now, bitcoin is pretty much mainstream now. Whenever you check any of the news channels, what is the best news all the time, all day every day? Bitcoin! It is the only interesting news which is happening on the planet, and will always be the best news of all time. In fact, my thought is ultimate new most important media people personalities etc. will be essentially people who work in TV Cinema media rappers podcast musicians bloggers vloggers thought leaders who philosophies and create content about bitcoin. First, Bitcoin is like the new iPhone. ￼ except the upside is that instead of every six months or a year or a year and a half, bitcoin is getting updated, all day, every day, every minute on the planet. So for example, with the iPhone and Apple… All these Fan boys just jerking off to Apple rumor news, waiting for the next next next next big thing to come out that will totally change and revolutionized their lives creativity etc. But, come on guys, we’re all technologists here and digital natives– don’t we already know that the solution is staring in our face, bitcoin? If you’re the type of person like you always want the newest iPhone Pro, Tesla, cyber truck, iPad Pro etc., isn’t also the same ethos be that you should always want the newest monetary technology which is bitcoin? Once again, very bizarre. Let us say you work at Apple Amazon Facebook Google Meta etc.… And your program or a software engineer, a developer, or somebody who works “tech”– is there any irrational reason you should be anti-bitcoin? No! I would say maybe the only negative downside is if you work in tech and you are a lemming. Even now Reddit is dead; if you’re still on Reddit, you’re not it. ￼ Also, maybe the issue here is that you’re kind of old enough now, and you’re kind of mildly successful, but maybe the issue here is that too much of your net worth is tied into your company dog? Just sell it guys, buy bitcoin instead, And or just buy micro strategy MSTR stock instead. It doesn’t matter if you’re being paid like $10 million a year at Apple Amazon Google Facebook, nobody actually wants to be there. Maybe besides Tim Cook? Let us consider, all of the innovators have left Apple. Jony Ive, and some people that I know who was in the head of the Apple Photos team. The only ones who have stayed at the big companies is that maybe, they’re stuck in a rut, maybe they have a mortgage to pay or something. If you do the maths a mortgage is actually insanely expensive like 10,000 or $11,000 a month? To even pour more money into a sink sink hole, which has true negative yield? A very very bad idea. It’s almost like it’s super cold outside, and you want to warm up by taking a nice hot bath. Can you turn on the bathwater, and you put up the plug, but, you kind of either leave the drain plug unplugged like halfway, or, You have it totally unplugged. So even if the water faucet is strong and the water is flowing into your tub at a quick rate, the rate in which the water goes down the drain might either be equal or lower than your input of water. So maybe the same thing with income, like inflow, or like flowing hot water. Assuming you want a nice hot tub of water, you want to drain the plug, stop the plug, stop it up 100%, and you want the hot water to rise and fill! Maybe we should think about the same thing with investing, and money leverage, Stop the water loss! We lose it when we have a mortgage on the home, and even a more pernicious thought; property taxes. Like let us say you buy that $2 million home in all cash, you’re still gonna be paying like 2500 or $2600 a month and adjust property taxes, which almost like attaching a leech to yourself which no matter what, the leech just sucks the blood out of you with no benefit to you. Now I am all for taxes, taxes are good. Yet, because I’ve just rented my whole life, property ownership home ownership even owning a single-family home seems like such a scam; you buy the lot for like $1.1 million, you add an ADU additional dwelling unit in the back for like $350,000, and then you try to flip it for like $200,000 More? Isn’t it just way easier to just buy bitcoin instead? The big reason is the cost to capital; all the headache and time to find the contractor to build the house, fix it up, renovate it, dealing with permits and all these headaches; and also your time cost to capital; so much time and headache and communication back-and-forth, is not really worth it. ￼ At this point because I’m dumb rich, to me the finances and the money aspect doesn’t really bother me, more of my concern and fear and dread is about having to deal with some sort of degenerate contractor, who buy the laws of physics and entropy will always be Late, more expensive, and will probably take one or two years longer than you expect. If you plan on doing the home thing, maybe the best idea is just approach things as if you will never hire help or a contractor? Then this way it could become more of a creative endeavor, and also, you know that you will never blame anyone else but yourself? Even like changing your own oil, the virtues of changing your own oil is pretty funny; I hate feeling ripped off, and I always feel super stupid for paying somebody else to change my oil. Even though it’s a huge pain in the butt for me to do it myself, I just have like 1 trillion times more joy and pride that I changed my own oil in my 2010 Prius, With mobile 1 full synthetic, and a K&N performance oil filter. It’s funny when I drive, I always have a huge grin and sense of pride on my face because I knew that I changed my own oil, 1 trillion more times happiness than even maybe driving a cyber truck or a Lamborghini? Nobody cares about your four bitcoin Ferrari; Once again, what I find so disruptive is that now… You will feel more joy pride and happiness to own the bitcoin, because you will always remember the number in your head in your mind, and you’ll always smile when you see the price exploding, rather than being stuck in a Diluted asset, whether does that be your yacht, Ferrari or Lamborghini. Or even your Porsche. If you really want to be happy, the optimal strategy assuming that you like own more than one car, or you don’t really need some sort of expensive performance vehicle that guzzles 91 octane gas, then I think optimal strategies to sell the extra car, and just buy bitcoin! In fact, if your goal is to actually make more money to upgrade to the next car, a funny strategy then is to just invest in bitcoin, write it up, make a shit load of money, and then just sell some of it later, to buy your next car. I’m super excited, the first time ever, I’m doing a free online open source zoom workshop, and don’t worry I will record it and post it later and share it with you because I feel like this is my new ethical imperative. I’m going to do it December 14, Saturday 10am to noon, Pacific time LA TIME. ￼ to register for the workshop to get the Zoom link, just fill out your email informed here, and before the workshop date, maybe like a day prior or so, I’ll email you with a Zoom link. FREE BITCOIN WORKSHOP REGISTRATION FORM You could also see some more details here. Essentially my vision is I just want to do a soft introduction to bitcoin the philosophy of it etc., the first hour hour and a half will just be like introductions and my lecture, and then I will leave some time at the end for questions and answers. It might go a bit over but whatever.￼ ￼￼￼ It will be totally 100% open and free, and also open source, so feel free to send the link to your friends, your mom or your dad who doesn’t really understand bitcoin, also I am fluent in Korean and Vietnamese, and also Spanish if you have some sort of bilingual parents you want to bring along. ￼> FREE BITCOIN WORKSHOP REGISTRATION FORM You could also see some more details here.

Title: Bitcoin Buying Plans Are Supercharging Stocks. Is This a Michael Saylor Redux — or Another 'Long Island Iced Tea' Fad?

What does the ragtag group including a fitness equipment maker, biopharmaceutical company and producer of battery materials have in common? Bitcoin, of course. As the cryptocurrency skyrockets to unheard-of levels this month, at least 12 publicly traded companies that previously had nothing to do with crypto announced they plan to buy bitcoin (BTC), choosing it as a modern — and, lately, quite profitable — place to park spare cash. It's a path illuminated by Michael Saylor's laser eyes since 2020, when he began converting his sleepy software maker MicroStrategy into a corporate vault for bitcoin. That's turned MicroStrategy into a massive stock market success — up roughly 30 times in value since Saylor began buying bitcoin for the company, amassing a massive stockpile now worth about $38 billion. Just this month, its shares have nearly doubled in price since Donald Trump was elected U.S. president after pledging to embrace crypto. (Other crypto stocks have jumped, too. Coinbase, the exchange operator, is up nearly 70% since the day before the election.) Others are trying to duplicate that success. On Friday, a biotech company, Anixa Biosciences (ANIX), said its board of directors approved buying an undisclosed amount of bitcoin to diversify the company's treasury reserves. The stock rallied as much as 19% but settled for a 5% advance by the end of the day. Meanwhile, on Thursday, fitness equipment company Interactive Strength (TRNR) said it plans to buy up to $5 million of bitcoin after its board approved the cryptocurrency as a treasury reserve asset. Following the announcement, its stock soared more than 80% at one point before settling for "only" a full-day gain of 11%. Earlier last week, biopharma company Hoth Therapeutics (HOTH) announced a $1 million bitcoin buying plan, triggering an up to 25% surge in its stock — though nearly the entire rally fizzled by the end of the day. Similarly, companies including LQR House (LQR), Cosmos Health (COSM), Nano Labs (NA), Gaxos (GXAI), Solidion Technology (STI) and Genius Group (GNS) saw momentary spikes in their stock prices after revealing bitcoin treasury plans in November. Only one company fell after its announcement: Acurx Pharma (ACXP). "The recent bitcoin boom, coupled with MicroStrategy's 500+% stock surge in 2024, has inspired a wave of companies — particularly microcaps — to announce bitcoin buying strategies," said Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining (BTCM). Whether these newcomers to the Saylor playbook will ever see Saylor-like benefits remains a very open question. "This behavior could end the same way [as previous bull markets]: unsustainable hype followed by sharp corrections as the market realizes many of these announcements lack substance," Yang said. And whether the recent entrants ever follow through is also technically unknown. So far, only artificial intelligence firm Genius Group is known to have actually bought any bitcoin. But who can blame them for trying? Investors who invested early in MicroStrategy are getting ridiculously rich, and even recent investors are making easy money. Saylor largely funds MicroStrategy's bitcoin purchases with money raised from stock and debt sales. The copycats might gain access to capital markets that they wouldn't otherwise have had. Traders are following the old adage, "Never fight the tape" — meaning follow the market's direction no matter the fundamentals, while companies are providing what the market wants. Nobody wants to be "that" person or company telling their bosses, shareholders or anybody else that they underperformed the market because they didn't follow MicroStrategy's footsteps. "Only a few years ago, it was almost too risky to buy bitcoin. Now, however, the risk increasingly seems to be the opposite — not buying is actually the risk," said Brian D. Evans, the CEO and founder of BDE Ventures, adding that "there’s real pain in not having exposure." To the hopefuls, this sudden corporate scramble might be a sign that mainstream bitcoin adoption is finally arriving, especially in an environment where President-elect Trump has said he wants the U.S. government to stockpile bitcoin, too. "For BTC proponents, the expectation is that a combination of macro factors such as inflation and new-found regulatory friendliness will spur further examples of the asset being placed on corporate balance sheets," Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial said in a report. Also, a bitcoin buying strategy could open up capital markets for companies, like it did for MicroStrategy and miner MARA Digital (MARA). Both were able to raise money recently through convertible debt that pays no interest to investors, meaning those investors are willing to forego current income in exchange for the ability to eventually convert the debt to equity, thus gaining bitcoin exposure. Saying they plan to buy bitcoin "is a useful way for companies to raise capital, not unlike the way MicroStrategy has done over the last few years," said BDE's Evans. However, to cynical ears, it all sounds a bit like the passing fad in the late 2010s that involved companies that previously had nothing to do with crypto adding the word "Blockchain" to their corporate name. The most famous example of this was little-known beverage maker Long Island Iced Tea renaming itself Long Blockchain, with an explosive result, at least initially: Its share price nearly tripled in a single day after the crypto-rechristening. The gains didn't stick and the stock was later delisted by Nasdaq. (And three people were accused of insider trading by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.) There have been other magic words. In the 2021 crypto bull market, big-name companies touted their Web3, metaverse and non-fungible token (NFT) initiatives — trying to hitch their shares to crypto and related hype. Facebook even changed its name to Meta to focus on the metaverse business, which subsequently faced massive losses. Meanwhile, companies with languishing share prices and no connection to crypto dipped their toes into bitcoin mining, a then extremely profitable business. The brutal bear market that followed turned crypto terminology into dirty words that few wanted to use. Though MicroStrategy has been able to raise billions from capital markets to fund bitcoin purchases, such a strategy, if pursued by others, could backfire for smaller companies, said Yang. "For microcaps, it risks being seen as a short-term gimmick, deterring serious investors. If bitcoin's price stabilizes or declines, the stocks' speculative appeal may fade, leaving these firms vulnerable to investor skepticism and regulatory scrutiny." Echoing this sentiment, David Siemer, co-founder and CEO of Wave Digital Assets, said, "While this approach may yield short-term gains in a bullish market, it carries significant risks. Unlike straightforward asset holding, leverage amplifies potential losses during market corrections, underscoring its inherent danger," he said, pointing to firms that are leveraging the hype around bitcoin to add debt to their balance sheet. Regardless of who is right, with bitcoin repeatedly smashing all-time highs after Trump's U.S. election win, magic remains in the air: Announce a Saylor-like bitcoin plan and see your stock take off. "It’s almost as though we are at a point where a lot of companies feel compelled to do this," BDE's Evans said. Welcome to the new crypto bull market.

Title: BIG BIT THOUGHTS.

I don’t think I know any human being on the planet who doesn’t want to be rich, or tries to increase their worth their net worth etc. Doesn’t matter if you’re an investor, work for a charity, a church etc. Money and capital are critical, it is like our economic life blood. For example, maybe you should think about blood. Blood is a critical and essential. Nobody could survive or thrive without blood. Now imagine… That somebody is taking your help four-year-old child, in drawing a pint of blood from them a day. What is going to happen to the health of your kid? It will severely stunt his growth, or positively kill him. Another thing… Imagine like you’re eating only rancid food your whole life, and the theory, you’re not going to die from it, but… Ain’t nobody want to eat rancid food. Or, let us assume that you’re consuming certain foods to just keep you alive, like beans, but everyone knows that beans cause flatulence, even an ancient Roman times, and technically raw beans are toxic. Lagoons, naturally do not want to be eaten or consumed. And therefore the toxic shell membrane they create is probably to ward off predators. ￼ And we clever humans, devised of ingenious ways to boil the shit out of them, just simply make them edible and not kill us. And the truth is, if you only ate beans you would not die, but… If you want to be the most demigod of them all, obviously you’re not going to be some sort of poverty person just consuming beans for some sort of strange higher altruistic purpose? Instead, you feast on the finest the bone marrow, the finest lamb ribs, just think about the hut of Achilles, what did he eat, and feed his guests? You know how they talk about life before Jesus life after Jesus, BC and AD… I am quite certain that a similar concept will happen with Satoshi. Like before Satoshi, life BS (before Satoshi, haha sounds like BS), and life AFTER Satoshi (AS). ￼ so the issue with being a modern day human or even American is that so much of the economic policies are obfuscated from the general public. For example. When I was in Saigon, in Vietnam off the grid, I had some time to critically think about economic theory and the like, to really try to critically understand on how currency is printed, made dominant around the planet, supported by US military force etc. In fact, if you think about the whole American the US military complex, it is basically focused on pumping money into the military industry, in order to assert military dominance on the planet, so all the weaker nations will have to force to use our dollars and accept and use our dollars, And also… America being able to pile on infinite debt obligations, knowing that she never intends to pay any of it back. So if we think about that, we know about debt in context of just being a normal human being, we don’t really know and understand debt in terms of an American national policy. For example, as a human being there’s a certain point in which numbers don’t really mean anything anymore. For example, I told you that the American national debt was 900 trillion, 45 trillion, $10 trillion, $18.3 trillion, would you be able to really understand or grasp this? Of course no! We daily humans, assume that you’re making like I don’t know 40,000 60,000, $80,000 a year… Which means maybe let us say that after taxes you’re pulling in like five to $6000 a month. If this is the case, the law of large numbers; at a certain point certain numbers don’t really mean anything to us, nor are they connected to reality. For example, the average American has never seen $1 million in their checking account or their bank balance, let alone 10 million, 100 million, 1 billion, 10 billion, 100 billion etc. ￼ There is a certain point in which numbers, ones and zeros, don’t really register in our brains. I always make the joke that I’m an Asian who is really really bad at math. And even now I am. And ironically enough, out of all my friends or typical normal human beings I know, besides Elon Musk and Michael Saylor, I am like by far the most successful innovator entrepreneur and investor of all time. I know no other human in the flesh who has stacked as many bitcoins as I have, and pretty much for the most part I never had to ever or I never panic sold any of my bitcoin. Besides selling some bitcoin like three years ago to just max out my Roth IRA contribution for the year, which ultimately I guess was a good idea because that money went into microstrategy MSTR, which is growing at an alarming rate, ￼– fortunately I had the wisdom of Odysseus; covering my ears and eyes with digital beeswax. ￼ About it, in hindsight, maybe one of the most interesting things I did was quit email in the year 2017. I might check my email like every six months or so for like authentication codes to sign into random portals, but besides this, I no longer really use email as a form of communication. If I’m doing like a workshop and I need to communicate some sort of critical information, ￼ then I’ll just copy and paste a bunch of emails, linked to Google sheets or something to send out a Zoom link or something. But besides this, email is really kind of a not good form of communication. Let us consider, i’m almost starting to feel like sending emails like sending a fax in the year 2024. I actually find it 1 trillion times more better to just FaceTime people as needed, — just think about it… All these sci-fi movies in the past, when they communicate with some sort of computer or AI, how do they do it? When you’re chatting with Jarvis it is all just a voice, and then you do the 3-D hologram thing with your hands like Tony Stark. Or if you’re Tony Stark in the Iron Man suit, what do you do? You talk to Jarvis naturally, when Jarvis is inside your helmet. In fact, I believe that the original Iron Man might be one of the best films of all time, I intend on watching it again. Anyways, once again, there is no exciting movie which is actually about somebody taking out a phone like an iPhone and either sending you a text message quietly, and or, sending a long tedious email? This will not make a fun movie. Anyways, as a consequence, I think the best concept is thinking about information information flows more critically, harder stronger faster. But knowing how to filter it. The first idea is Twitter and X. It might be the world‘s newest most valuable and only useful social media platform, now that Elon Musk runs the show, and I’m like 1000% Elon, it is really truly the best and only place to get critical information about financial news etc. My thought is traditional news outlets will die a slow gradual death, just like blockbuster. It’s funny, because I remember when I was in college, and I already saw my roommate Kevin ordering Netflix DVDs in the mail, which at the time I thought was very bizarre, but I knew that blockbuster was on the way out. I wanted to short blockbuster, but eventually did not because I just didn’t know how to do it, even now I’m not quite sure how to short a stock, it just seems too complicated. ERIC Semmler, one of the head honchos at semler scientific, is also on the bitcoin standard, using bitcoin yield, BTC yield as a measure of positive performance. Funny enough he also shares my name. Anyways, I listen to an interview between him and Natalie Brunel, and something was interesting was ERIC who has been in the game for a long time, the century said that shorting stocks is actually really really difficult and very rarely profitable. Rather a lot better to instead, to just go along in a positive way for a stock. And also I agree from a philosophical perspective, voting on the success of something, and voting on the success of a stocking company, to me almost morally an ethically feels superior; the reason being is that it just feels more positive and constructive. And also it might be more profitable? Investing in bitcoin is kinda good for everybody, even if you’re like kind of anti-establishment, anti-capitalism… Bitcoin is a positively good thing. Why? If you invest in bitcoin and you purchase bitcoin, and you put yourself in your family on a bitcoin standard, the upside and positivity is that You are essentially giving a middle finger to the establishment, the “man”. For example, anybody who is a non-conformist, punk rock, into rapper hip-hop culture whatever… Steve Jobs follower, etc., should be for bitcoin. Why? Because once again, it is anti-mainstream! Even now, bitcoin is pretty much mainstream now. Whenever you check any of the news channels, what is the best news all the time, all day every day? Bitcoin! It is the only interesting news which is happening on the planet, and will always be the best news of all time. In fact, my thought is ultimate new most important media people personalities etc. will be essentially people who work in TV Cinema media rappers podcast musicians bloggers vloggers thought leaders who philosophies and create content about bitcoin. First, Bitcoin is like the new iPhone. ￼ except the upside is that instead of every six months or a year or a year and a half, bitcoin is getting updated, all day, every day, every minute on the planet. So for example, with the iPhone and Apple… All these Fan boys just jerking off to Apple rumor news, waiting for the next next next next big thing to come out that will totally change and revolutionized their lives creativity etc. But, come on guys, we’re all technologists here and digital natives– don’t we already know that the solution is staring in our face, bitcoin? If you’re the type of person like you always want the newest iPhone Pro, Tesla, cyber truck, iPad Pro etc., isn’t also the same ethos be that you should always want the newest monetary technology which is bitcoin? Once again, very bizarre. Let us say you work at Apple Amazon Facebook Google Meta etc.… And your program or a software engineer, a developer, or somebody who works “tech”– is there any irrational reason you should be anti-bitcoin? No! I would say maybe the only negative downside is if you work in tech and you are a lemming. Even now Reddit is dead; if you’re still on Reddit, you’re not it. ￼ Also, maybe the issue here is that you’re kind of old enough now, and you’re kind of mildly successful, but maybe the issue here is that too much of your net worth is tied into your company dog? Just sell it guys, buy bitcoin instead, And or just buy micro strategy MSTR stock instead. It doesn’t matter if you’re being paid like $10 million a year at Apple Amazon Google Facebook, nobody actually wants to be there. Maybe besides Tim Cook? Let us consider, all of the innovators have left Apple. Jony Ive, and some people that I know who was in the head of the Apple Photos team. The only ones who have stayed at the big companies is that maybe, they’re stuck in a rut, maybe they have a mortgage to pay or something. If you do the maths a mortgage is actually insanely expensive like 10,000 or $11,000 a month? To even pour more money into a sink sink hole, which has true negative yield? A very very bad idea. It’s almost like it’s super cold outside, and you want to warm up by taking a nice hot bath. Can you turn on the bathwater, and you put up the plug, but, you kind of either leave the drain plug unplugged like halfway, or, You have it totally unplugged. So even if the water faucet is strong and the water is flowing into your tub at a quick rate, the rate in which the water goes down the drain might either be equal or lower than your input of water. So maybe the same thing with income, like inflow, or like flowing hot water. Assuming you want a nice hot tub of water, you want to drain the plug, stop the plug, stop it up 100%, and you want the hot water to rise and fill! Maybe we should think about the same thing with investing, and money leverage, Stop the water loss! We lose it when we have a mortgage on the home, and even a more pernicious thought; property taxes. Like let us say you buy that $2 million home in all cash, you’re still gonna be paying like 2500 or $2600 a month and adjust property taxes, which almost like attaching a leech to yourself which no matter what, the leech just sucks the blood out of you with no benefit to you. Now I am all for taxes, taxes are good. Yet, because I’ve just rented my whole life, property ownership home ownership even owning a single-family home seems like such a scam; you buy the lot for like $1.1 million, you add an ADU additional dwelling unit in the back for like $350,000, and then you try to flip it for like $200,000 More? Isn’t it just way easier to just buy bitcoin instead? The big reason is the cost to capital; all the headache and time to find the contractor to build the house, fix it up, renovate it, dealing with permits and all these headaches; and also your time cost to capital; so much time and headache and communication back-and-forth, is not really worth it. ￼ At this point because I’m dumb rich, to me the finances and the money aspect doesn’t really bother me, more of my concern and fear and dread is about having to deal with some sort of degenerate contractor, who buy the laws of physics and entropy will always be Late, more expensive, and will probably take one or two years longer than you expect. If you plan on doing the home thing, maybe the best idea is just approach things as if you will never hire help or a contractor? Then this way it could become more of a creative endeavor, and also, you know that you will never blame anyone else but yourself? Even like changing your own oil, the virtues of changing your own oil is pretty funny; I hate feeling ripped off, and I always feel super stupid for paying somebody else to change my oil. Even though it’s a huge pain in the butt for me to do it myself, I just have like 1 trillion times more joy and pride that I changed my own oil in my 2010 Prius, With mobile 1 full synthetic, and a K&N performance oil filter. It’s funny when I drive, I always have a huge grin and sense of pride on my face because I knew that I changed my own oil, 1 trillion more times happiness than even maybe driving a cyber truck or a Lamborghini? Nobody cares about your four bitcoin Ferrari; Once again, what I find so disruptive is that now… You will feel more joy pride and happiness to own the bitcoin, because you will always remember the number in your head in your mind, and you’ll always smile when you see the price exploding, rather than being stuck in a Diluted asset, whether does that be your yacht, Ferrari or Lamborghini. Or even your Porsche. If you really want to be happy, the optimal strategy assuming that you like own more than one car, or you don’t really need some sort of expensive performance vehicle that guzzles 91 octane gas, then I think optimal strategies to sell the extra car, and just buy bitcoin! In fact, if your goal is to actually make more money to upgrade to the next car, a funny strategy then is to just invest in bitcoin, write it up, make a shit load of money, and then just sell some of it later, to buy your next car. I’m super excited, the first time ever, I’m doing a free online open source zoom workshop, and don’t worry I will record it and post it later and share it with you because I feel like this is my new ethical imperative. I’m going to do it December 14, Saturday 10am to noon, Pacific time LA TIME. ￼ to register for the workshop to get the Zoom link, just fill out your email informed here, and before the workshop date, maybe like a day prior or so, I’ll email you with a Zoom link. FREE BITCOIN WORKSHOP REGISTRATION FORM You could also see some more details here. Essentially my vision is I just want to do a soft introduction to bitcoin the philosophy of it etc., the first hour hour and a half will just be like introductions and my lecture, and then I will leave some time at the end for questions and answers. It might go a bit over but whatever.￼ ￼￼￼ It will be totally 100% open and free, and also open source, so feel free to send the link to your friends, your mom or your dad who doesn’t really understand bitcoin, also I am fluent in Korean and Vietnamese, and also Spanish if you have some sort of bilingual parents you want to bring along. ￼> FREE BITCOIN WORKSHOP REGISTRATION FORM You could also see some more details here.

Title: How 123RF saved over 90% of their translation costs by switching to Amazon Bedrock
URL: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/how-123rf-saved-over-90-of-their-translation-costs-by-switching-to-amazon-bedrock/

In the rapidly evolving digital content industry, multilingual accessibility is crucial for global reach and user engagement. 123RF, a leading provider of royalty-free digital content, is an online resource for creative assets, including AI-generated images from text. In 2023, they used Amazon OpenSearch Service to improve discovery of images by using vector-based semantic search. Building on this success, they have now implemented Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku to improve their content moderation a hundredfold and more sped up content translation to further enhance their global reach and efficiency. Although the company achieved significant success among English-speaking users with its generative AI-based semantic search tool, it faced content discovery challenges in 15 other languages because of English-only titles and keywords. The cost of using Google Translate for continuous translations was prohibitive, and other models such as Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet and OpenAI GPT-4o weren’t cost-effective. Although OpenAI GPT-3.5 met cost criteria, it struggled with consistent output quality. This prompted 123RF to search for a more reliable and affordable solution to enhance multilingual content discovery. This post explores how 123RF used Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku, and a vector store to efficiently translate content metadata, significantly reduce costs, and improve their global content discovery capabilities. After implementing generative AI-based semantic search and text-to-image generation, they saw significant traction among English-speaking users. This success, however, cast a harsh light on a critical gap in their global strategy: their vast library of digital assets—comprising millions of images, audio files, and motion graphics—needed a similar overhaul for non-English speaking users. The crux of the problem lay in the nature of their content. User-generated titles, keywords, and descriptions—the lifeblood of searchability in the digital asset world—were predominantly in English. To truly serve a global audience and unlock the full potential of their library, 123RF needed to translate this metadata into 15 different languages. But as they quickly discovered, the path to multilingual content was filled with financial and technical challenges. Idioms don’t always translate well As 123RF dove deeper into the challenge, they uncovered layers of complexity that went beyond simple word-for-word translation. The preceding figure shows one particularly difficult example: idioms. Phrases like “The early bird gets the worm” being literally translated would not convey the meaning of the word as well as another similar idiom in Spanish, “A quien madruga, Dios le ayuda”. Another significant hurdle was named entity resolution (NER)—a critical aspect for a service dealing with diverse visual and audio content. NER involves correctly identifying and handling proper nouns, brand names, specific terminology, and culturally significant references across languages. For instance, a stock photo of the Eiffel Tower should retain its name in all languages, rather than being literally translated. Similarly, brand names like Coca-Cola or Nike should remain unchanged, regardless of the target language. This challenge is particularly acute in the realm of creative content. Consider a hypothetical stock image titled Young woman using MacBook in a Starbucks. An ideal translation system would need to do the following: These nuances highlighted the inadequacy of simple machine translation tools and underscored the need for a more sophisticated, context-aware solution. In their quest for a solution, 123RF explored a spectrum of options, each with its own set of trade-offs: This exploration laid bare a fundamental challenge in the AI translation space: the seemingly unavoidable trade-off between cost and quality. High-quality translations from top-tier models were financially unfeasible, whereas more affordable options couldn’t meet the standard of accuracy and consistency that 123RF’s business demanded. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies such as AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Throughout this transformative journey, Amazon Bedrock proved to be the cornerstone of 123RF’s success. Several factors contributed to making it the provider of choice: The first breakthrough in 123RF’s translation journey came through a collaborative effort with the AWS team, using the power of Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku. The key to their success lay in the innovative application of prompt engineering techniques—a set of strategies designed to coax the best performance out of LLMs, especially important for cost effective models. Prompt engineering is crucial when working with LLMs because these models, while powerful, can produce non-deterministic outputs—meaning their responses can vary even for the same input. By carefully crafting prompts, we can provide context and structure that helps mitigate this variability. Moreover, well-designed prompts serve to steer the model towards the specific task at hand, ensuring that the LLM focuses on the most relevant information and produces outputs aligned with the desired outcome. In 123RF’s case, this meant guiding the model to produce accurate, context-aware translations that preserved the nuances of the original content. Let’s dive into the specific techniques employed. The team began by assigning the AI model a specific role—that of an AI language translation assistant. This seemingly simple step was crucial in setting the context for the model’s task. By defining its role, the model was primed to approach the task with the mindset of a professional translator, considering nuances and complexities that a generic language model might overlook. For example: A clear delineation between the text to be translated and the instructions for translation was implemented. This separation served two purposes: For example: One of the most innovative aspects of the solution was the implementation of a scratchpad section. This allowed the model to externalize its thinking process, mimicking the way a human translator might work through a challenging passage. The scratchpad prompted the model to consider the following: The team incorporated multiple examples of high-quality translations directly into the prompt. This technique, known as K-shot learning, provided the model with a number (K) of concrete examples in the desired output quality and style. By carefully selecting diverse examples that showcased different translation challenges (such as idiomatic expressions, technical terms, and cultural references), the team effectively trained the model to handle a wide range of content types. For example: The culmination of these techniques resulted in a prompt template that encapsulated the elements needed for high-quality, context-aware translation. The following is an example prompt with the preceding steps. The actual prompt used is not shown here. This template provided a framework for consistent, high-quality translations across a wide range of content types and target languages. Although the initial implementation yielded impressive results, the AWS team suggested further enhancements through dynamic prompting techniques. This advanced approach aimed to make the model even more adaptive and context aware. They adopted the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique for creating a dynamic prompt template with K-shot examples relevant to each phrase rather than generic examples for each language. This also allowed 123RF to take advantage of their current catalog of high quality translations to further align the model. The team proposed creating a vector database for each target language, populated with previous high-quality translations. This database would serve as a rich repository of translation examples, capturing nuances and domain-specific terminologies. The implementation included the following components: This structured approach to storing and retrieving text-translation pairs allowed for efficient, context-aware lookups that significantly improved the quality and relevance of the translations produced by the LLM. The top matching examples from the vector database would be dynamically inserted into the prompt, providing the model with highly relevant context for the specific translation task at hand. This offered the following benefits: The following is an example of a dynamically generated prompt: This dynamic approach allowed the model to continuously improve and adapt, using the growing database of high-quality translations to inform future tasks. The following diagram illustrates the process workflow. How to ground translations with a vector store The process includes the following steps: The impact of implementing these advanced techniques on Amazon Bedrock with Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku and the engineering effort with AWS account teams was nothing short of innovative for 123RF. By working with AWS, 123RF was able to achieve a staggering 95% reduction in translation costs. But the benefits extended far beyond cost savings: The success of this project has opened new horizons for 123RF and set the stage for further advancements: 123RF’s success story with Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic’s Claude is more than just a tale of cost reduction—it’s a blueprint for how businesses can use cutting-edge AI to break down language barriers and truly globalize their digital content.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. If you’re looking for a deal on anything Apple sells—an iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, iPhone or anything else—there’s no better time to get one than Black Friday. No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—and some are at the lowest we’ve ever seen. The sales start earlier every year, but the best deals are usually seen between Black Friday (November 29) and Cyber Monday (December 2). However, as we head into Black Friday week, we’re already seeing fantastic deals, so you might not want to wait. We’ll be updating this page regularly as more discounts come in. If you want to know what Apple is doing for Black Friday, it’s offering gift cards up to $200/£160 with select purchases. We have the details of that deal and what’s included in our Apple’s 2024 Black Friday Shopping Event article. Black Friday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page up to and throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B&H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October 2024. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM unless it’s much more than $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model. U.S. Foundry Additionally, Apple’s older MacBook Pro models are on clearance as retailers look to clear out remaining stock: U.K. Apple’s older MacBook models are on clearance at the following retailers: The iMac and Mac mini both received new M4 chips in October, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that. Grab money off a new iMac. Foundry U.S. There are savings on the older models as well: U.K. In the U.K. when Apple announced the iMac and Mac mini in 2024 it dropped prices compared to the previous generation, so keep this in mind if considering a discount on an M3 model. These older models are also discounted: The AirPods 4 with and without ANC are Apple’s newest earbuds that replaced the AirPods generation 2 and 3 in September. Apple also updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise, it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday, but this year beware: you may see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is that even if you see a good deal on the AirPods 3 you should spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. The AirPods 4 without ANC cost $129/£129 and compare very favorably with the AirPods 3 which used to cost $179/£179. AirPods 4 are Apple’s newest earbuds and are already on sale. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. There are also savings on older models, but as we mentioned above, we recommend skipping any AirPods 3rd gen deals because the AirPods 4 are much better. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra. Traditionally, any savings around $50 is an excellent deal. Look out for the Apple Watch Series 9 as there may be some deals on the discontinued model. U.S. U.K. Apple updated all of its iPads in 2024 with the exception of the 10th-gen entry-level model (though it did get a price cut to $349). The iPad mini was the most recent model to get a refresh, with a new chip and 8GB of RAM. We are seeing some good deals on new iPads. Foundry U.S. U.K. U.S. Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. You can read our best Black Friday iPhone deals roundup for more information. U.K. David Price / Foundry In October, Apple updated its Mac accessories with USB-C ports but didn’t bring any other changes. If you’re buying a new Apple Pencil the Apple Pencil Pro is the newest model and compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. The USB-C Apple Pencil is also compatible with these models as well as the 10th-gen iPad, but doesn’t have squeeze gestures or magnetic charging. If you see a deal on the any Apple Pencils make sure they work with your iPad! Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. Every year Apple holds a shopping event from Black Friday (November 29 in 2024) to Cyber Monday (December 2). However, since Apple rarely discounts its products, the event consists of gift card offers rather than actual savings. The newest products are excluded, so don’t expect any offers on the iPhone 16 or new MacBooks. You can get gift cards for the following amounts with the following purchases made on Apple’s U.S. site or Apple’s U.K. site. Here’s how it compares to last year and the year before. Stay tuned to Macworld throughout November to find the best deals as they arrive. But if you’re looking for a specific color or capacity, you can check out the following retailers. In the U.S., here are the best stores to shop for Black Friday deals: If you’re based in the U.K., you’ll find deals at the following shops: Check out these Lightning tech deals before they go.

US stocks climbed on Monday amid high hopes for President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary. Investors also looked ahead to a Federal Reserve-favored inflation print. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the advance, up about 250 points, or roughly 0.6%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.6%, while those the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up almost 0.7%. Stocks are kicking off a holiday-shortened week with more of the upbeat mood that lifted the gauges to weekly wins. Markets will shut on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and close early on Friday. The Dow closed last week at a record high, gaining almost 2% on the week. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 were both up over 1.5% as they crept closer toward the initial levels seen after the election. Trump tapped Bessent, viewed as the "investor favorite" pick for Treasury, late Friday evening after a surprisingly drawn-out process that saw candidates' stock seem to rise and fall by the day. Bessent's nomination has seemed to at least temporarily calm nerves over the president-elect's inflationary agenda, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dipping back to 4.36%. On the inflationary front, the Fed will get its preferred look at the picture heading into Trump's term with Wednesday's release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. Economists expect a tick up in "core" PCE, which is closely watched by the central bank. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) was in search of a milestone $100,000-per-coin level amid a near-50% surge over the past month. It was hovering around the $98,000 mark early Monday.

Title: Elon Musk has big return-to-office plans for federal employees and he’s saying the quiet part out loud

Time Published: 2024-11-25T13:13:25Z

Good morning! The return-to-office debate got a bit spicier last week with Elon Musk’s latest promise to make the government more efficient. In an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal, the billionaire appointed to head up the new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) along with his co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy, laid out plans to reduce the overall size of the government and cut costs. And one part of that blueprint included mandating a full return-to-office for all Federal workers. “Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome: If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the COVID-era privilege of staying home,” they wrote. In doing so, Musk and Ramaswamy seem to be openly announcing what some critics have long argued is a disguised impetus behind strict RTO mandates: Job cuts. One survey this year of more than 1,500 U.S. managers found that a quarter of C-suite executives were hoping that return-to-office policies would encourage employees to voluntarily quit. After all, it’s certainly cheaper than having to do layoffs and pay severance. Other CEOs have discussed potential attrition due to five-day RTO mandates. Last month, Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman told staffers during an all-hands meeting that it’s “OK” if people don’t want to work in an office environment because there are “other companies around.” That led many employees to sign an open letter to corporate leadership noting his remarks were “inconsistent with the experiences of many employees” and “misrepresenting the realities of working at Amazon.” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy pushed back against allegations that the company’s RTO requirement was an excuse to lay off workers and said the decision was “not a cost play.” The Federal government is the nation’s largest employer, with over 2.2 million civilian staffers. Until now, each agency has been able to decide what workplace policy works best for them. Of the total number of Federal workers, roughly half work on-site, according to an August report from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. While remaining employees are eligible for remote work, the report found that only 228,000, or roughly 10%, were in remote positions where there was no expectation that they work in-person. And those who have the option to work remotely spent about 60% of working hours in-person at various job sites. It’s unclear if Musk and Ramaswamy will actually be able to implement a five-day RTO for Federal workers. And of course, the question remains: Will these CEOs return to the office themselves? That’s yet to be seen. Brit Morsebrit.morse@fortune.com Today’s edition was curated by Emma Burleigh. A round-up of the most important HR headlines.

Title: US Supreme Court Permits Multibillion-Dollar Class Action By Investors Against Meta
URL: https://www.medianama.com/2024/11/223-us-supreme-court-permits-multibillion-dollar-class-action-against-meta/
Time Published: 2024-11-25T12:10:51Z

MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India The US Supreme Court has permitted a multibillion-dollar class action lawsuit by investors against Facebookâs parent company, Meta. This has stemmed from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm, reported AP. The justices heard arguments in November regarding Metaâs attempt to dismiss the lawsuit. The Supreme Court dismissed Meta’s appeal, upholding a lower court decision that allowed the case to proceed. Investors claimed that Meta failed to adequately disclose the risks tied to the misuse of Facebook users’ personal data by Cambridge Analytica. The firm allegedly supported Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. The investors argue that insufficient disclosures caused two significant declines in Metaâs stock price in 2018. These drops occurred after the public learned the full extent of the privacy breach. Meta had reached a $725 million settlement with users over privacy violations over Cambridge Analytica data leak, reported CNN.Â The Cambridge Analytica scandal highlighted significant privacy concerns, with the firm collecting personal data from millions of Facebook users without consent. The firm, with connections to Trump strategist Steve Bannon, paid a Facebook app developer for access to personal information. This data came from approximately 50 million users. The firm used this data to target U.S. voters during the 2016 election campaign. The now-defunct firm allegedly gathered personal data from numerous users without their consent. A former Cambridge Analytica employee, Christopher Wylie, brought the scandal to light. Wylie disclosed that Cambridge Analytica used this data to build psychographic profiles and influence voters. Wylie described the technology as âSteve Bannonâs psychological warfareâ tool.Â The data was gathered via an app called “This Is Your Digital Life.” Around 270,000 people and used their FB account to login to the app. The app then accessed not only their information but also data from their Facebook friends which resulted in the ballooning of the number of people the app collected data on. Facebook later acknowledged that their policies at the time allowed this. The app asked users a series of questions to construct psychological profiles. These profiles helped identify individuals likely to support their clients. Cambridge Analytica reportedly provided its services to former U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign, using micro-targeting techniques to influence voter behavior. The firm also worked on the Brexit campaign, sparking concerns about the “hijacking” of democracy. âWe were able to get upwards of 50 million-plus Facebook records in the span of a couple of months,â stated Wylie. Facebook responded by suspending accounts related to Cambridge Analytica, its parent company Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), Kogan, and Wylie. The incident sparked global outrage. Similarly, UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham began an inquiry into the misuse of Facebook data. âAny criminal and civil enforcement actions arising from the investigation will be pursued vigorously,â she emphasised. Eventually, a court filing in August 2022 indicated that Facebook had reached a settlement in the Cambridge Analytica privacy lawsuit, reported BBC. The agreement was finalized shortly before the company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, and former COO, Sheryl Sandberg, were scheduled to provide depositions in September 2022. With the settlement in place, the depositions did not proceed. Meta agreed to pay $725 million dollars to resolve the class-action lawsuit.Â In India, Cambridge Analytica reportedly collaborated with political parties for past elections and explored partnerships with both the BJP and Congress for the 2019 general elections.Â Cambridge Analytica and its Indian partner, Oveleno Business Intelligence (OBI) Private Limited, engaged in discussions with both parties for potential collaboration on their campaigns for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Both BJP and Congress denied links with the companies but accused one another of utilizing the services of the company.Â Despite the allegations, the firm and its Indian partner planned to continue their work unless authorities proved that Cambridge Analytica violated Indian laws. âWhat may be illegal and unethical in one place may not be in India and vice versa. So it is too early to say anything,â stated OBIâs CEO Amrish Tyagi.Â Cambridge Analyticaâs website highlighted its involvement in the 2010 Bihar Assembly elections, where it conducted an in-depth electorate analysis. âOur client achieved a landslide victory, with over 90% of total seats targeted by CA being won,â the site claimed. Eventually, India took down the local website for Cambridge Analytica following the allegations against the company, reported BBC.Â Have something to tell us?

The Big Tech Titans: Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft face mounting scrutiny as the Trump ... [+] administration's antitrust agenda targets industry monopolies and reshapes the future of technology. November 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice filed its proposed final judgment, recommending sweeping remedies to dismantle Google’s search monopoly. This long-awaited action marks the most significant antitrust move in decades and could become a pivotal moment for Big Tech as President Trump prepares for his second term. At the core of the DOJ’s plan is the requirement for Google to sell its Chrome browser. The proposal also includes a framework for divesting Android if behavioral remedies fail to increase competition. Remedies include banning exclusive default agreements with device makers and prohibiting Google from developing new browsers. Unsurprisingly, Google is pushing back strongly and Google’s chief legal officer Kent Walker called the DOJ’s plan a “radical interventionist agenda,” asserting it goes “miles beyond” the concerns outlined by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, who ruled in August that Google held monopolies in two markets. With President Trump back in the White House in January, speculation is mounting over whether his administration will pursue even more drastic actions against Big Tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Apple. Such moves could reshape not only the tech industry but also the global economy. The incoming Trump administration has long signaled an aggressive stance on Big Tech, citing concerns about censorship, market dominance and monopolistic practices. High-profile figures in Trump’s circle, such as former Congressman Matt Gaetz and Vice President J.D. Vance, have long been critics of tech monopolies. Gaetz has focused on perceived censorship of conservative voices, while Vance has called for reforms to rein in monopolistic practices. Pam Bondi, Trump’s new nominee for attorney general, could play a key role in this agenda. Bondi has a notable record of consumer protection and antitrust enforcement, having recovered over $1 billion in such matters as Florida’s attorney general. However, her direct involvement with Big Tech enforcement has been limited. Bondi’s public support for former President Trump’s lawsuit against Facebook, Twitter and Google in 2021 suggests a willingness to challenge Big Tech’s influence but leaves questions about her approach to structural remedies. This momentum aligns with rare bipartisan support, highlighted by the latest action from the DOJ under President Biden. Influential Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have also advocated breaking up Big Tech, arguing that monopolies stifle innovation and harm small businesses. With mounting pressure from both sides of the aisle, Big Tech now faces an unprecedented challenge. The U.S. is not alone in scrutinizing Big Tech. Across the Atlantic, European regulators, led by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, have ramped up investigations. Proposed remedies, such as forcing Google to divest its ad tech business, reflect a global trend toward stricter oversight. European lawmakers like Andreas Schwab advocate robust measures to ensure fair competition and foster innovation. These efforts could inspire similar actions in other jurisdictions, further pressuring U.S.-based tech giants. A breakup of major tech firms could echo past antitrust actions, such as the breakup of AT&T’s Bell System in the 1980s or the case against Microsoft in the 1990s. Here’s a closer look at the likely targets: A breakup of Big Tech could have profound implications for innovation. Large tech companies have been instrumental in advancing cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and sustainable energy solutions. For instance, Microsoft and Amazon have explored nuclear power options to meet the energy demands of AI data centers. Disrupting these corporate giants could slow progress in areas like AI development and power generation, particularly as hyperscalers have the resources to invest in ambitious, long-term projects. However, breaking up Big Tech might also create opportunities for smaller, more agile companies to step up. A less concentrated market could foster competition, enabling a diverse range of businesses to tackle these challenges. This democratization of innovation could lead to creative solutions that were previously overshadowed by Big Tech’s dominance. While the transition could bring short-term disruption, it may ultimately stimulate a more competitive technological landscape. A breakup of Big Tech would create seismic shifts in the industry, presenting both opportunities and challenges: While a breakup is not guaranteed, the bipartisan appetite for antitrust reform and the Trump administration’s rhetoric suggest significant changes are possible. A dismantling of Big Tech could redefine how technology is developed, consumed and regulated in the U.S. and beyond. The stakes are enormous. As the tech industry braces for potential upheaval, businesses, policymakers and consumers must prepare for a future that could look radically different. Whether this transformation fosters a more competitive marketplace—or introduces new challenges—remains to be seen. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: What Wall Street Analysts Think of Dell's Stock Ahead of Earnings

Time Published: 2024-11-25T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Dell (DELL) is set to report third-quarter earnings after the market closes Tuesday, with analysts anticipating sales and profit gains from the year prior, but little further appreciation for the stock. Of the 10 analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha, eight have a "buy" or equivalent rating, compared to two "hold" ratings. However, their consensus price target of $145 would imply less than 1% upside from Friday's closing price. Wall Street expects Dell to report third-quarter revenue of $24.68 billion, an 11% rise year-over-year, and net income of $1.02 billion or $1.42 per share, up from $1 billion or $1.36 per share a year ago. Morgan Stanley analysts told clients in a note Thursday they “don’t expect much upside” from Dell’s third-quarter earnings, but suggested the company could see more growth in 2025 from artificial intelligence (AI) servers. Dell makes servers that utilize Nvidia (NVDA) AI chips, drawing a shoutout from the chipmaker in its earnings call Wednesday. For now, results could be hindered by “sub-seasonal PC market trends” and “flattish” quarter-over-quarter AI server growth, the analysts said. Morgan Stanley holds an “overweight” rating and $154 price target for Dell. Dell shares have gained nearly 90% since the start of the year, at $144.21 as of Friday's close.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Trending on Financial Media. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that are trending on financial media. The AI revolution has disrupted the technology industry, propelling memory chip firms into the spotlight after decades spent in the shadows of semiconductors and software giants. In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion. In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Private equity firm Bain Capital is one of the most prominent backers of Kioxia. The latter is among the largest makers of NAND flash memory in the world. NAND quality directly affects the processing speed and overall performance of AI models. Bain led a consortium to acquire Kioxia from Toshiba for $18 billion in 2018. The private equity firm has tried twice to get the memory chipmaker listed on the stock exchange, once in 2018 and then again earlier this year.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

On November 21, Phillip Securities downgraded the stock to Accumulate from Buy with a price target of $160, up from $155, following the Q3 report. The advisory cites the recent movement in the shares for the downgrade. It also lowered margin assumptions for fiscal 2026 to reflect management guidance of lower margins due to Blackwell products. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are trending on financial media. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The hedge fund manager takes a piece of a popular consumer brand. Today, Millennium has over $70 billion in assets under management and is one of the world's largest hedge funds. Investors should understand that Millennium is a "pod shop," which means it allocates capital to different teams (or "pods") that all have their own strategies and a lot of autonomy. In the third quarter, Millennium sold large portions of its stakes in artificial intelligence (AI) companies Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) and bought a new stock that Wall Street thinks can soar. Broadcom isn't the only way to tap the AI revolution. There are currently eight publicly traded companies with market caps of $1 trillion or more: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Berkshire Hathaway. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), the world's biggest retailer and the largest company in the world by revenue, has quietly blown away the rest of the retail sector in recent years as its commitment to omnichannel sales and reputation for everyday low prices have delivered steady growth. Walmart reported another round of strong quarterly results on Tuesday morning. Microsoft and Broadcom are more stable long-term AI plays. Markets will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving. Earnings from retailers and October inflation data will be the week's highlights. On the surface, Boeing (NYSE: BA) looks as though it has all the ingredients of a potential millionaire-maker investment. The aircraft market is growing, competition is minimal, and government contracts are plentiful. The phrase "economic moat" -- popularized by investing legend Warren Buffett -- refers to certain types of durable competitive advantages a company can possess that make it difficult for potential rivals to make inroads against it. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) did it again. Shares pulled back slightly on the news as investors have gotten accustomed to the chip titan regularly besting expectations, and some analysts wanted to see stronger fourth-quarter guidance, which called for $37.5 billion in revenue -- a 70% increase from the quarter a year ago. At the time of this writing, Nvidia is now worth $3.5 trillion. One FAANG stock was unceremoniously left out of the "Magnificent Seven." That was a costly blunder. The party may come to an abrupt end for Wall Street. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Examining Nancy Pelocy's Selling on Google and More

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In an efficient market, it is believed that everyone has equal information, nonetheless the way the market interprets and reacts to the information may vary. But the market speculated that maybe Nancy Pelosi, the congresswoman who's been one of the most active traders in Capitol Hill, has more knowledge than the rest of us regarding to investments. Nancy Pelosi is a democrat politician and a representative fom California and she was known to sell part her Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stocks inr December 2022, only a month before the DOJ came out with its antitrust lawsuit targeting Google's advertising practices in January 2023. The timing of Pelosi's stock sale and the DOJ's lawsuit caught people's attention that maybe she had prior knowledge of the lawsuit. Well, the lawsuit was initially filed in October 2020. The DOJ accused Google running monopoly practices over the online search. The lawsuit was then developed in January 2023 targeting Google's digital advertisingpractices. And now in 2024 the DOJ proposed a remedy to Google to sell its web browser Chrome. This is one of the most significant antitrust cases against technology company after Microsoft's case in the late 1990s. As this case resurface, people in many investing forums are buzzing about Pelosi's Google stock sale that occurred just a month prior to the DOJ's second lawsuit. She might be a prominent political figure, and her influence in policy and funding decisions may affect the DOJ's operations, but she has no direct hand in determining DOJ's decisions. Nancy Pelosi as Investment Guru? Let's admit it, she's good with her investments with impressive gains in her portfolio. In 2023 alone her portfolio earned her a staggering $43 million and already accumulated $23 million in profits since the beginning of 2024. Maybe she has more knowledge than most market participants or she just simply good with her investment screening? Let's take a look at her portfolio and track her trading activity a little closer. Gurufocus has Politician Trading Tracker feature (that I just discover recently), and Nancy Pelosi is in the politician list. Her most recent transaction was on July 26, 2024 she purchased shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and now the price is already 24% higher than her purchase price. On the display we also can see that she exited fully on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on June 24, 2024 and the price closed on the date at $182.58 per share. Just for your information she bought Tesla on March 18, 2022 at $301 per hare, that means she lost. And now Tesla's current price is $352.26 per piece. If our assumption that she knew something outside us; the commoners, then she exiting on certain stock must be anticipated. Turns out, her selling on Tesla break the assumption. And after Nvidia, she also sold partially her Microsoft and Visa shares in July 2024. While the price of Microsoft oscillated under the range of $410s- to 420s, Visa now has moved 14% higher since July. And look at the two option calls that she did on Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Palo Alto Network (NASDAQ:PANW). See the strike price; $800 for AVGO to be exercised on June 20, 2025? Wow! That's aggressive, 487% higher from AVGO's current price! Meanwhile, she did a good job with PANW, she sets the call's strike price at $200, where today's price for PANW is $383. The exercise price was set on January 17, 2025. Looking at her decisions; bought NVDA, sold partially MSFT and V, and her two options calls, maybe she really does her homework, she screens and stockpicks with not much whispers from the DOJ, or any other government bodies. Unlike the DOJ that against Google's dominance, I'm a big fan of Google's web browser Chrome and the fact that Google dominates the world is something that doesn't bother me. Her timing of exiting Google caught my attention too. But other than Google, her investment decision is much like us the commoners; some end up well and some fail. Again, maybe she's just a common investor (with power in the congress) and do things like any of us do; screen and stockpick in good old-fashioned way. What do you think?

Just for your information she bought Tesla on March 18, 2022 at $301 per hare, that means she lost. And now Tesla's current price is $352.26 per piece. If our assumption that she knew something outside us; the commoners, then she exiting on certain stock must be anticipated. Turns out, her selling on Tesla break the assumption. And after Nvidia, she also sold partially her Microsoft and Visa shares in July 2024. While the price of Microsoft oscillated under the range of $410s- to 420s, Visa now has moved 14% higher since July. And look at the two option calls that she did on Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Palo Alto Network (NASDAQ:PANW). See the strike price; $800 for AVGO to be exercised on June 20, 2025? Wow! That's aggressive, 487% higher from AVGO's current price! Meanwhile, she did a good job with PANW, she sets the call's strike price at $200, where today's price for PANW is $383. The exercise price was set on January 17, 2025. Looking at her decisions; bought NVDA, sold partially MSFT and V, and her two options calls, maybe she really does her homework, she screens and stockpicks with not much whispers from the DOJ, or any other government bodies. Unlike the DOJ that against Google's dominance, I'm a big fan of Google's web browser Chrome and the fact that Google dominates the world is something that doesn't bother me. Her timing of exiting Google caught my attention too. But other than Google, her investment decision is much like us the commoners; some end up well and some fail. Again, maybe she's just a common investor (with power in the congress) and do things like any of us do; screen and stockpick in good old-fashioned way. What do you think?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI News Updates You Can’t Miss This Weekend. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) stands against other AI news updates you can’t miss this weekend. The race to get ahead in artificial intelligence is compelling companies to intensify their efforts each day. In latest news, ChatGPT creator OpenAI has been considering developing its own web browser, according to a report by The Information. The report reveals that the company has spoken about the product with websites such as Redfin, Conde Nast, Priceline, and Eventbrite. Having already entered the market with SearchGPT, the move would be placing OpenAI head-to-head with Google, the company that holds the major share of the browser and search market. READ ALSO: 10 AI News Stories You Can’t Miss and 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now However, the company isn’t just delving into search and browsers. According to Tech Crunch, OpenAI is also researching algorithms that can predict human being’s moral judgments. OpenAI gave a grant to Duke University researchers for a project called “Research AI Morality.” When asked for more details, an OpenAI spokesperson referred to a press release stating that the grant is part of a larger $1 million, three-year funding effort for Duke Professors working on creating “moral AI.” As per the press release, the OpenAI-funded project aims to develop algorithms capable of “predicting human moral judgments” when moral conflicts arise in fields like medicine, law, and business. However, it isn’t clear yet whether such kind of an achievement is possible with the current levels of technology. In other news, AI firm Anthropic is getting another funding boost. Amazon is increasing its investment in Anthropic to $8 billion, strengthening its partnership in artificial intelligence, the companies announced Friday, the 22nd. “We’ll keep pushing the boundaries of what customers can achieve with generative AI technologies.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). lassedesignen/Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89 GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) is a global energy company and a soaring AI stock driven by the demand for energy to power artificial intelligence technology. On November 21, Wells Fargo analyst Michael Blum initiated coverage of the power-generation technology company with an “Overweight” rating and a $385 price target. This is the second-highest price target listed by FactSet, as reported by Barrons. According to Blum, GE Vernova can help meet the massive energy demands from artificial intelligence through its power generation and grid products. Blum further states that GE Vernova’s transformers, HVDC, and grid software offerings are well-positioned to benefit from growing power demand. “As power demand grows and more distributed generation is added to the mix, aging grids will require significant investment to manage the increasingly complex and dynamic environment,” Blum said. “GEV’s transformers, HVDC [High-voltage direct current], and grid software offerings are well positioned to benefit from this growing demand”. Overall, GEV ranks 2nd on our list of AI news updates you can’t miss this weekend. While we acknowledge the potential of GEV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GEV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Nvidia Stock May Rise As Musk Aims To Buy $9 Billion In AI Chips

Musk discussed with Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO of Nvidia Corp.,(L) his outlook and views on the future of autonomous cars. (Photo by Kim Kulish/Corbis via Getty Images) Will Nvidia’s growth rate keep slowing down? If so, investors may be wise to take their profits. However, if the AI chip designer’s new products spur faster growth, now might be a buying opportunity. Stock prices rise when companies exceed investor expectations and raise guidance, while they drop if companies fall short on either one. Nvidia is no exception to this rule. To justify buying Nvidia stock now that it’s the most valuable company in the world — having enjoyed a 195% rise in its share price to a market capitalization of $3.5 trillion this year — you must believe the company will keep beating and raising. If Nvidia significantly exceeds conservative growth targets with help from Blackwell, the stock could rise despite slowing revenue growth, dependence on a few large customers, and the absence of a killer app to deliver a return on the rising investment needed to train and operate AI chatbots. Nvidia stock presents investors with significant risks. These include the following: My guess is investors are baking all these negatives into their expectations. Indeed, despite Nvidia’s slowing growth in 2024, the company’s stock has continued to rise. This could be because the company did a good job of lowering investors’ growth expectations to date. Positive surprises to growth would keep Nvidia stock rising. Huge orders for the company’s latest chip line by the largest AI service providers — coupled with growing corporate interest in applying AI to make processes more efficient — could provide investors with unexpected good news. Here’s how: Until Nvidia can unlock faster-than-expected growth, its stock could be stuck in a trading range. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: After Nvidia earnings, is the AI trend still investors’ friend?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Trends are trends because they come and go, with the world of investing and markets certainly no exception. In 2020, it was work from home. In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the "Magnificent Seven." And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top. A quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it’s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips. Its most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday. There’s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings. But when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains — a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period — weren’t what they used to be. Nvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023. AI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware. “We are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,” Creative Strategies director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report. On the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they’re spending on AI hardware. Nvidia’s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer’s Jacob Bourne. “Critical questions around Blackwell’s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,” Bourne said in a note. “There’s little room for execution missteps in 2025.” There is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump’s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs. For the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%. That said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter. Of course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings. Check out more Nvidia analysis from Yahoo Finance The bigger question is whether AI will transform computing over the long term or whether it’s just another investing trend.

Title: Mizuho Raises NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Price Target to $175, Reaffirms Outperform Rating Amid Strong AI Market Leadership

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. Data centers are at the heart of the AI disruption sweeping markets across the world. However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe’s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 21, Mizuho raised the price target on the stock to $175 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares after the company reported a strong October-end quarter sales result of $35.1 billion and guided January-end quarter revenue to $37.5 billion, which the advisory notes was in line with consensus at $37 billion, but below buy-side estimates of $39 billion-plus. The advisory, which says Nvidia remains a Mizuho 2024 Top Pick and is leading the AI accelerator market, recommends investors buy the pullback. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Washington Post has descended into a dark abyss - here’s why

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/24/2024 3:42:15 AM PST by Libloather The Washington Post used to be one of the best gigs in journalism. No longer. In a business where it generally sucks to be an employee (except for the NY Post, of course), the “WaPo,” as it is known in journalism circles, has really descended into the abyss, On The Money has learned. Top reporters want out of what they see as crappy new work conditions and possibly more layoffs coming. It’s a shame, of course. The paper and its journalists — think Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and their dogged pursuit of Watergate — set the gold standard for reporting. They are the reason so many went into the business, including yours truly. Sure, Woodward remains at the paper, as do many amazing reporters. But the decline of print as a viable business model, plus the leftward lurch of a new generation of ink-stained wretches that turns off readers, has decimated readership — and the paper’s balance sheet. The Post changed hands years ago from the Graham family to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. He’s one of the world’s richest men, but he hates losing money, people who know him tell On The Money. That includes the tens of millions a year he’s sinking into the paper. Bezos brought in new management this year like publisher Will Lewis, a WSJ alum (the WSJ and the NY Post share common ownership), to de-woke the place and help it at the very least break even. But it’s either not working or not working well enough to satisfy Bezos’ desire to stop throwing good money after bad, people close to him say. That’s why in addition to financial discipline (some recent layoffs, and possibly more in the future), Lewis is demanding some personal discipline as well. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Top reporters want out of what they see as crappy new work conditions and possibly more layoffs coming. It’s a shame, of course. The paper and its journalists — think Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and their dogged pursuit of Watergate — set the gold standard for reporting. They are the reason so many went into the business, including yours truly. Sure, Woodward remains at the paper, as do many amazing reporters. But the decline of print as a viable business model, plus the leftward lurch of a new generation of ink-stained wretches that turns off readers, has decimated readership — and the paper’s balance sheet. The Post changed hands years ago from the Graham family to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. He’s one of the world’s richest men, but he hates losing money, people who know him tell On The Money. That includes the tens of millions a year he’s sinking into the paper. Bezos brought in new management this year like publisher Will Lewis, a WSJ alum (the WSJ and the NY Post share common ownership), to de-woke the place and help it at the very least break even. But it’s either not working or not working well enough to satisfy Bezos’ desire to stop throwing good money after bad, people close to him say. That’s why in addition to financial discipline (some recent layoffs, and possibly more in the future), Lewis is demanding some personal discipline as well. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

But the decline of print as a viable business model, plus the leftward lurch of a new generation of ink-stained wretches that turns off readers, has decimated readership — and the paper’s balance sheet. The Post changed hands years ago from the Graham family to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. He’s one of the world’s richest men, but he hates losing money, people who know him tell On The Money. That includes the tens of millions a year he’s sinking into the paper. Bezos brought in new management this year like publisher Will Lewis, a WSJ alum (the WSJ and the NY Post share common ownership), to de-woke the place and help it at the very least break even. But it’s either not working or not working well enough to satisfy Bezos’ desire to stop throwing good money after bad, people close to him say. That’s why in addition to financial discipline (some recent layoffs, and possibly more in the future), Lewis is demanding some personal discipline as well. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

The paper and its journalists — think Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and their dogged pursuit of Watergate — set the gold standard for reporting.Deep Throat (or Mark Felt) eventually had a falling out with Bob Woodward because the Washington Post refused to publish all the information that Felt furnished to Woodward, namely that both Watergate burglaries were a CIA-led operations. The WaPo ignored and refused to publish information that would put Nixon in a favorable light. The Washington Post was fake news before Dan Rather and 60 Minutes invented fake news. 13 posted on 11/24/2024 4:47:12 AM PST by Right_Wing_Madman [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Right_Wing_Madman The Compost has been a water-carrier for the CIA since the 1950s—Operation Mockingbird.

That includes the tens of millions a year he’s sinking into the paper his holding company bought for $250 million in October 2013. Bezos brought in new management to de-woke the place and at the very least break even. But it’s not working well enough to stop throwing good money after bad, people close to him say. Insert the that’s a shame gif Charlie Gasbag whining again. Print media committed suicide by lying just like the MSM did. No sympathy. That certainly doesn't speak well for you. Maybe Elon Musk will buy it. the “WaPo,” as it is known in journalism circles known as the “compost” in other circles the compost’s leftward lurch is recent?

Then, just after the Nats won the WS, he got political, so I canceled my subscription. I read that he has retired, so no more Pravda on the Potomac for me! Print media across the country runs AP news. The rag we subscribe to runs their trash and it’s no different than MSNBC or CNN. Just about any article the AP puts out is editorial grade where facts are seldom and lies are frequent. Over the years the physical size of the paper used as well as the number of pages in a daily print are probably less than a 10th what it used to be in paper weight.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, a roundup of some of our top stories. Cars with a manual transmission now make up a tiny share of autos sold in the US. An updated Porsche 911 Carrera is a reminder of how fun they can be, says BI's chief car reviewer. On the agenda today: But first: Look out, government workers. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. For a minute there, working for the government was in vogue. TikTok videos espoused the benefits of #publicsector jobs, and Google searches for "how to get a government job" hit a five-year high. Younger workers, in particular, were drawn to employment considered less vulnerable to layoffs. Then Elon Musk arrived on the scene. The Department for Government Efficiency, co-headed by Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, has outlined plans to slash federal jobs. DOGE will work with agency appointees to find the minimum number of employees required to perform its functions, per the duo. That has some government workers on edge. (You can see where the most federal staffers work and how much they're paid here.) Several careers consultants told Business Insider they were already experiencing a rush of demand from workers ready to shift to the private sector. Laura Labovich, CEO of The Career Strategy Group, told BI that these workers weren't complaining about their promotion prospects or compensation, as they might have in the past. "They just say, 'I want to leave,'" she said. Comcast, one of the biggest cable TV companies in the US, announced plans to split off almost all of its cable TV networks — CNBC, MSNBC, USA, and a few digital assets — but keep the rest of its media business, including Peacock, NBC, and Bravo. The move further cements the decline of cable, as the number of people paying for and watching these networks is falling every year, BI's Peter Kafka writes. More on the big break up. Also read: By all the standard economic measures, America's labor market looks fine. But ask any white-collar professional, and they'll tell you a horror story that would prove otherwise. Hiring has held up well for low-earning workers, but those making six figures or more are in the midst of a white-collar recession. New data from LinkedIn, which tracked how often its users landed new jobs, shows that tech jobs in particular have been among the hardest hit. More on who's being affected by the hiring slump. Your age probably says a lot about how you remember TGI Fridays. The restaurant chain began as a singles bar in the '60s, and then it evolved into a family-friendly spot in the '80s and '90s. Now, it's a place no one really wants to go. Fridays closed 36 underperforming corporate-owned restaurants at the beginning of the year and recently filed for bankruptcy. Its slow decline and accelerated crash is a familiar story for many restaurant chains. Why casual dining went bust. Amazon's voice assistant became something of a household icon when it launched a decade ago. But maintaining that success has proved difficult. Now, the company is trying to save Alexa with an AI-powered upgrade and improved capabilities. Partnerships with Uber and Ticketmaster were supposed to make Alexa smarter — but issues have delayed the upgrade's release. Are you there, Alexa? This week's quote: "Chrome has served Google exceptionally well, but its loss would be a manageable inconvenience." — Teiffyon Parry, chief strategy officer at adtech company Equativ, on the DOJ's request that Google sell off Chrome.

Time Published: 2024-11-24T11:33:12Z

UPDATED 06:33 EST / NOVEMBER 24 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / NOVEMBER 24 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems.

Title: Goldman Sachs says these 11 stocks are next in line to benefit from the AI wave as Magnificent 7 dominance starts to fade

This year, the AI story has dominated the stock market. Just seven stocks have fueled much of the market's rally: Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla. The Magnificent Seven have returned 148% since the end of 2022, drastically outperforming the 55% return for the rest of the S&P 500 index over that time. These tech behemoths have seen their earnings turbocharged by their market dominance in sectors such as cloud computing, software, and semiconductors. AI infrastructure stocks have also started to take off. Data-center stocks like Vertiv and Digital Realty have soared as the demand to build out AI capacity has risen. But now, so-called "Phase 3" AI stocks, which are rolling out the technology to increase their revenues, are set to shine, according to Goldman Sachs. 2025 will be the year of transition from investing in AI infrastructure to AI beneficiaries, Goldman's Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin said. Two years after the debut of ChatGPT, more and more revenue-generating use cases for AI are emerging. "While Phase 2 stocks may continue to outperform the broad equity market, we expect returns will be earnings-driven and the risk/reward for new capital appears more attractive within Phase 3," Kostin and his team wrote in a recent note. After an incredible two-year rally, it's may be difficult to see the Magnificent Seven cooling off. The stocks have shown impressive earnings growth in the last year and have come to dominate the market, making up about 30% of the S&P 500 by market cap. However, the growth that placed them there isn't sustainable for the long term, Kostin said. That's not to say that the Magnificent Seven aren't solid companies. Goldman still expects them to outperform the rest of the index in 2025, but the bank is expecting them to do so by only 7%. For context, the Magnificent Seven outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 by 22% so far this year and 63% in 2023. Valuations for the market's biggest performers are overripe: the Magnificent Seven trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30x, while the rest of the index trades at a modest 19x. That's where the AI Phase 3 trade comes in. These companies, whose revenues and earnings are set to get a boost from AI implementation, are valued much more reasonably, with the typical Phase 3 company trading at only 0.1 standard deviations more expensive than average, compared to 0.5 for Phase 2. Valuations for Phase 3 stocks are depressed due to a recent decreased enthusiasm for AI, as some market experts have been questioning if AI is a trillion-dollar bubble ready to pop, according to Goldman Sachs. Lower expectations for Phase 3 stocks isn't necessarily a bad thing, though — it makes it easier for these companies to beat investor expectations and increase their share price. On the other hand, expectations for Nvidia have risen so high that the stock still fell in after-hours trading in the wake of consensus-beating Q3 revenue performance. "The share price performance of the companies in the infrastructure basket has dramatically outpaced their trajectory of earnings growth," Kostin said of Phase 2 companies. On the other hand, companies in the AI-enabled revenue group have seen share price growth in line with earnings growth. "And so our analysis is there's potential for multiple expansion in those stocks," Kostin added. To find companies likely to see enhanced revenues from AI, Goldman Sachs analyzed recent messaging from company management regarding AI rollout. The bank identified the following 11 companies adopting AI to enhance their revenues as well as recent commentary from Q3 earnings calls indicating increased AI usage. Ticker: ACVA Earnings commentary: "Our appraisal solutions incorporate AI imaging for damage detection and real-time localized pricing that is condition-enhanced, based on millions of inspections in our data mode. It's still early days in this category, but we believe self-inspection can unlock a number of long-term growth opportunities, including TAM expansion." Ticker: CVLT Earnings commentary: "And with our recent Clumio acquisition, we're bringing innovative recovery capabilities to Amazon S3. This depth is paramount as many organizations rely on S3 to store large data and growing AI datasets." Ticker: NET Earnings commentary: "A rapidly growing AI company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one-year, $7 million pool of funds contract for Workers AI. This company signed a $500,000 contract in Q2 for Cloudflare to be their 'platform for AI for inference, storage, image optimization and application security.' They quickly recognized the value of our platform and are now moving all of their workloads over to make Cloudflare their single inference cloud platform. With Workers AI, this customer is able to improve cost efficiency with our pay per inference model and also eliminate the need for a dedicated team to run and manage their infrastructure." Ticker: DDOG Earnings Commentary: "At the end of Q3, about 3,000 customers used one or more Datadog AI integrations to send us data about their AI, machine learning, and LLM usage. As some of these experiments start turning into production AI applications, we are seeing initial signs of traction for our LLM Observability product. Now, some of our growth is coming from AI-native customers, who this quarter represented more than 6% of our Q3 ARR, up from more than 4% in Q2 and about 2.5% of our ARR in the year-ago quarter." Ticker: DOCN Earnings commentary: "Revenue growth remained steady in the third quarter at 12% year over year, with solid performance in Core Cloud and continued growth in AI despite lapping difficult comps from our managed hosting price increase in April 2023 and from the Paperspace acquisition in July 2023. We continue to see momentum in demand for our AI/ML products, where Q3 ARR again grew close to 200% year-over-year." Ticker: DT Earnings commentary: "We closed a seven-figure expansion with a leading finance management platform. This customer had limited visibility into the thousands of incidents occurring in their production environment. They estimated that these incidents were costing them hundreds of thousands of dollars. By extending Dynatrace's AI-driven platform into their production environment, they gained substantive visibility and resultant business value." Ticker: FTNT Earnings commentary: "AI Security Operation was a fast-growing pillar, outpacing the overall market with 32% billings growth, accounting for 10.5% of our total business, up 2 points." Ticker: IT Earnings commentary: "We see great demand from our clients on the issues you'd expect, so like cybersecurity, how do they use artificial intelligence, data and analytics." Ticker: HUBS Earnings commentary: "Our strategy is to embed AI into every hub and across the entire platform and democratize AI for scaling companies. Since the launch, we have seen a notable increase in AI awareness, adoption and usage. AI app awareness within HubSpot grew by 13% quarter-over-quarter with two-thirds of Enterprise and half of Pro customers engaging with AI features. Copilot, our AI assistant, has resonated well, particularly with Starter customers who use it to summarize CRM data and objects, rewrite text and generate insights from their customer data. Copilot is now in public beta, and we are seeing repeat usage with 43% of users, which is a strong start." Ticker: MA Earnings commentary: "We've now boosted the product with GenAI and the outcome that we see is tremendous. This is up to a 20% lift that we see. Now these are solutions that our customers opt in to because they like those solutions, and they like the lift that they get out of that." Ticker: NOW Earnings commentary: "ServiceNow has emerged as the AI platform for business transformation. The secular shift to AI is validated and is unfolding in real time. With Now Assist, we have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV, including six over $5 million, and two over $10 million, and this continues to be our fastest-growing product ever, and an accelerant to our cross-enterprise expansion."

The busiest shopping week of the year has arrived, bringing with it a frenzy of questions: What to buy? Where to buy? And how much to buy? Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday mark the start of the holiday shopping season, drawing millions of consumers to stores and online platforms in search of the best deals. And, of course, there’s excitement for the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade later this month. More than just a shopping extravaganza, this period serves as a critical barometer of the nation’s economic health. Retail sales during these days offer valuable insights into consumer confidence, spending habits, and the overall financial pulse of the country. This year, holiday sales are projected to reach nearly $1 trillion, a 3.5% increase over the last year, according to the National Retail Federation. To help you navigate the excitement, here’s a curated list of retailers offering deals this holiday season, whether you’re shopping for tech, fashion, or home essentials. Walmart (WMT+0.62%) shoppers have a chance to score deals on both practical items and more extravagant gifts. While Black Friday discounts are available to all customers, Walmart’s loyalty members get exclusive perks, including early access to online deals. Additionally, Walmart is introducing “deal drops” and an AI shopping assistant to assist customers. On Amazon (AMZN-1.04%), Black Friday deals are available to all customers. Prime members often get extra perks, like early access to select deals – sometimes up to 30 minutes ahead of the general public. Target (TGT+2.83%) announced price cuts on 2,000 items in October, adding to the 5,000 products it marked down in May. Target shoppers have the opportunity to snag deals on everyday essentials and higher-end items. While Black Friday discounts will be available to all shoppers, Target’s loyalty members receive additional benefits, including early access to online deals and unlimited same-day delivery. If you want to buy fancy bags from Coach, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and others, check the list here for what they have to offer. This week, investors will see a lighter schedule for earnings reports, with no announcements expected on Thursday or Friday due to the Thanksgiving holiday. The stock market will be closed on Thursday, Thanksgiving day. However, the first half of the week remains eventful. On Monday, Bath & Body Works (BBWI+1.93%) is set to release its earnings results before the market closes. Tuesday will feature a flurry of activity from major retailers. Macy’s (M+0.47%), Burlington Stores (BURL+0.54%), Best Buy (BBY-0.40%), and Kohl’s (KKS) will announce their earnings before the market opens, providing insights into consumer spending trends as the holiday shopping season kicks off. Later in the day, tech giants Dell Technologies (DELL-12.25%) and HP (HPQ-11.37%) will report their earnings after the market closes. Also on Tuesday, cybersecurity leader CrowdStrike (CRWD-4.58%) will release its quarterly results post-market. This update will be closely watched, especially after the company faced a global outage earlier this year, raising questions about its resilience and operational performance. With key sectors including retail, technology, and cybersecurity in focus, these earnings could offer valuable indicators for broader market trends ahead of the holiday break. This week’s shortened schedule due to the Thanksgiving holiday means a lighter-than-usual release of macroeconomic data. However, several significant reports are still on the docket, providing valuable insights into the economy. On Tuesday, the Consumer Confidence Index for November will be released, offering a glimpse into consumer sentiment amid ongoing economic uncertainties. Additionally, new home sales data for October will be published, shedding light on activity in the housing market. In the afternoon, the FOMC minutes meeting will be made available, potentially offering clues about the central bank’s monetary policy outlook and inflation strategy. The economic focus continues on Wednesday, starting with the release of initial jobless claims, a weekly barometer of labor market health. Also on Wednesday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, a key measure of inflation tracking changes in consumer spending on goods and services, will be published. This data is closely watched by the Federal Reserve in shaping interest rate decisions. Additionally, the GDP’s first revision for Q3 will be released, providing an updated view of the economy’s performance during the third quarter. — Francisco Velasquez and Madeline Fitzgerald contributed to this article.

Title: Commentary: Stealth firing or ethical dismissal? Why employers terminate staff for minor offences
URL: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/stealth-firing-retrenchment-layoff-worker-employee-conduct-offence-4764586
Time Published: 2024-11-23T22:00:00Z

Commentary Enforcing a hard line on employee conduct could prevent bigger lapses but may prompt claims of disguised cost savings, says Anjli Raval for the Financial Times. As companies try to rein in costs and restrict workplace initiatives that do not help profits, workers are wary of falling victim to a fresh horror: The stealth sacking. (Photo: iStock) LONDON: Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy recently told employees that a new plan requiring them to be in the office five days a week did not amount to a “backdoor layoff”. Yet his reported comments at a company-wide meeting last week did not rebut a previous suggestion from a senior manager that staff who fail to comply could look for work elsewhere. As companies try to rein in costs and restrict workplace initiatives that do not help profits, workers are wary of falling victim to a fresh horror: The stealth sacking. Alongside a string of recent publicly announced mass layoffs – by companies including Nissan, Boeing and Citigroup – there have been a series of employers quietly justifying smaller-scale dismissals because of seemingly minor violations of company policy. Here the focus is not on the size and scope of redundancy programmes, how humanely managers handled them or whether support or severance pay was offered to affected staff, but on the specific rationale behind the decisions. Facebook owner Meta, for example, sacked about two dozen staff for abusing meal credit vouchers, while EY terminated the employment of a group of workers for watching multiple training videos at once, the Financial Times has reported. Infractions that workers have probably interpreted as minor misdemeanours in the past can now be sackable offences, and may prompt questions about whether cost savings are being disguised. “As with most stories, there are two sides,” says Leo Martin, managing director of GoodCorporation, a business ethics consultancy that helps organisations design, build and improve their ethics and compliance programmes. “From the employee perspective they may have been given unrealistic deadlines, excessive work pressures or have received unclear guidance as to what is expected, while the employer will feel that abusing a perk or taking short-cuts undermines their systems, [and that] cheating in an exam or lying about training … is a fundamental breach of trust.” Part of the motivation to take a tough line on employees could be to make an example of anyone deemed to be a rule-breaker. This level of corporate discipline has been more common among heavily regulated industries, such as banking and financial services, that have huge compliance functions and the risk of hefty penalties for any conduct breaches. Amanda Rajkumar, who has held senior human-resources (HR) leadership roles at JPMorgan Chase and BNP Paribas, says: “Banks and financial services have always come down hard … given the robust regulatory environment and strong requirement to demonstrate exemplary, ethical behaviour related to the fiduciary nature of the industry.” Another incentive for a tough stance is that small infractions, such as taking advantage of company perks or bending minor rules, can foreshadow more serious ethical lapses. This has fuelled a “zero-tolerance” approach to policy enforcement in some sectors, as companies seek to preserve what they see as a culture of integrity. One example from the financial crisis was when Fidelity Investments fired employees for being part of a fantasy football league that went against the company’s gambling rule. Early this year, several employees at US retailer Target were sacked after they used their status as staff to buy highly coveted Stanley cups ahead of customers. “The spotlight should be on the employees’ reason or motivation for breaking the rules,” adds Rajkumar. “A deliberate misuse of company resources usually indicates low engagement or a specific gripe against the firm.” A recent trend of staff turning to online platforms to vent their frustrations about perceived mistreatment by employers or indiscriminate layoffs has also pushed some companies to recalibrate their approach. Websites such as LinkedIn and anonymous review site, Glassdoor, give workers an outlet for grievances about their bosses, which can then spread quickly and damage the reputation of employers. In one example that went viral this year, Brittany Pietsch, an employee at internet company Cloudflare, recorded her nine-minute virtual meeting with HR representatives in which she was fired, and posted it to TikTok, spawning a new “Quit-Tok” trend. In the video, Pietsch confronted her seniors about the reasons for her termination, but they had “no specific” answers or “clarity”. Aware that employee complaints about terminations are no longer confined to private HR files, some companies are aiming to reduce backlash and curb reputational risk by emphasising policy-driven grounds for firing. Recruiters, HR heads and workplace experts say whether an employer has made a clear case for dismissal is becoming as important as the manner in which a termination is conducted. “Companies have had to be more mindful when they are firing staff because people are more vocal. We are in an era where snap decisions can have big blowbacks,” says Habiba Khatoon, a director at headhunter Robert Walters. She adds that in her experience managers are so wary of dismissing workers out of turn that they are delaying action until a record has been built of repeated performance issues or behaviour that violates company policy. Khatoon says more companies are talking about so-called “ethical firing”. This refers to a transparent, rule-based approach to dismissals, where managers can point to concrete breaches in policy rather than subjective issues, such as workers being a “poor fit”. Targeting terminations in this way has some advantages for employers. Basing decisions on documented infractions can help reduce staff numbers – and cut costs – without the optics of a struggling business that come with mass layoffs. And unlike big rounds of job cuts, which often require severance packages, firings for conduct issues are typically exempt from such obligations. Lucas Shaw, an expert in hiring and retention strategies, says he has been part of a conversation in which senior staff at a company – not one of his clients – instructed their IT team to look for misconduct on an individual’s record to avoid paying a costly redundancy settlement. “It’s incredibly underhand.” Employment experts say such practices underscore the need for staff to closely read and understand company policies and codes of conduct, which are at times being followed more rigidly than in the past. The advice for employers is to provide stronger and simpler guidelines about what is acceptable and what is not. Rules and disciplinary processes must be unambiguous and fairly applied no matter how senior an employee is. “Companies need to ensure they carry out fair and thorough investigations regarding any allegation of misconduct,” says GoodCorporation’s Martin. “Not only does this ensure a proper process is followed, it can also protect an organisation from accusations that what they are doing may have an ulterior motive.” In an era when workers prioritise transparency, selective enforcement of codes of conduct can erode trust as employees might see it as an excuse to target some staff. This, in the long run, may “be more damaging to the company than the actual employee misconduct”, warns Martin.

Brookfield Corporation describes itself as a “leading global investment firm focused on building long-term wealth for institutions and individuals.” The Toronto, Canada-based firm is an alternative asset manager that operates businesses in a wide array of industries, including asset management, real estate, infrastructure, renewable energy, private equity, and more. During the third quarter, renowned investors like Bill Ackman and Daniel Loeb accumulated significant positions in Brookfield. Loeb’s Third Point Capital, which has nearly $7.5 billion in assets under management, initiated a new position in the company, buying 4,725,000 shares for an average price of $53.15 per share, according to the firm’s 13F filing. Brookfield is Third Point’s eleventh-largest holding as of the filing. At the same time, Bill Ackman’s firm Pershing Square, which was already an investor in Brookfield after initiating a position during the second quarter, increased its stake in the company by nearly 380%. Pershing Square now owns 32,735,883 shares of Brookfield and is the fund’s largest holding, accounting for 13.5% of assets, indicating that Ackman has significant conviction in the pick and sees it as one of the best investment opportunities in the current market. Brookfield has proven itself to be a long-term winner. Over the past decade, the company has delivered a phenomenal total return of 800%. This massive total return easily outpaces that of the broader market — the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) returned 187.3% over the same time horizon. And Brookfield’s track record of generating exceptional returns goes back even further then that — the company has delivered a phenomenal total annualized return of 18% over the past 30 years. While Brookfield has an excellent long-term track record, it isn’t resting on its laurels — it says that its best days are still ahead of it and that it is now better-positioned than ever before to deliver annualized returns of 15% or more going forward. Brookfield’s management says it will achieve this by investing in good businesses, running these businesses well, wisely allocating free cash flow, aligning everyone with its long-term goals, and adapting to the changing world around them. Examples of the company adapting to the changing world include its extensive investments in the energy transition and its involvement in data centers. Brookfield management says it expects to grow free cash flow by 20% per share on an annual basis over the next five years. This means it will generate a total of $47 billion in free cash flow over this time frame, or $30 per share that it can “allocate wisely,” which is an attractive total given that shares currently trade for $57.67. Brookfield says this will help it to deliver annualized returns on invested capital of 16% over the next five years. While shares currently trade for $57.67, Brookfield believes they are worth an intrinsic value of $84 per share today and that this 16% CAGR on invested capital will bring it to a valuation of $176 per share by 2029, meaning that the share price could be more than triple over the next five years. Obviously, a lot can happen between now and 2029, and even the best plans can face unexpected challenges. There’s also certainly no guarantee the market will agree with Brookfield about the intrinsic value of its shares at that point in time. That said, even if Brookfield doesn’t reach this exact number, there is plenty of room for considerable upside between the current share price and Brookfield’s target, making this a tempting value proposition for investors. Brookfield also believes that it is well-positioned to grow earnings per share at a 20% clip over the next five years to $9.77 per share (up from $3.67 for 2024). If the company can achieve this, it is trading for a song at today’s prices. While these are lofty targets, Brookfield’s excellent track record over multiple decades lends credibility to the idea that the company can achieve many of these goals. While Brookfield has a fairly low dividend yield of 0.6%, it’s worth noting that it has still returned an impressive $20 billion worth of capital to its shareholders over the last five years through both dividends and share buybacks. With cash flow expected to increase in the years to come, as discussed above, I would expect the company to continue to reward its shareholders with considerable capital returns. Turning to Wall Street, BN earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, zero Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average BN stock price target of $60 implies 2.4% upside potential from current levels. See more BN analyst ratings Adding to Brookfield’s appeal, it also achieves a Perfect 10 rating from TipRanks’ Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. Scores of eight, nine, or 10 are considered equivalent to an Outperform rating, so Brookfield’s perfect rating is particularly impressive. Shares of Brookfield have posted strong gains over the past year, and the stock is catching the eye of renowned investors like Third Point’s Daniel Loeb and Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman. But you don’t have to be a hedge fund manager to gain exposure to this compelling investment opportunity; everyday investors can add Brookfield to their own portfolios. If management can execute on achieving this five-year vision, this would represent phenomenal returns for all of the stock’s investors. I’m bullish on Brookfield based on the confidence of these prestigious investors, its track record as a long-term winner, and its compelling roadmap for delivering substantial returns over the next five years.

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. OpenAI announced this week that it’s starting to roll out Advanced Voice Mode on the web browser version of ChatGPT. Paid users of ChatGPT Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu will be able to start a real-time conversation on the ChatGPT website. The AI startup also announced that it updated its GPT-4o model’s creative writing ability to have “more natural, engaging, and tailored writing.” The updated model can also work better with uploaded files, OpenAI said. The Allen Institute for AI announced its Tülu 3 family of open, fine-tuned models this week. The fine-tuning, or post-training, process refines models to perform specific tasks. Through Tülu 3, developers and researchers can find open-source data sets, model training recipes, code, and evaluation frameworks. The models range from 8 billion to 70 billion parameters, or the variables a model learns from training data that guide its ability to make predictions, according to Ai2. Enveda, a biotech company that uses AI to turn natural compounds into new medicines, announced an oversubscribed $130 million Series C funding round this week. The round was led by Kinnevik and FPV, and brings Enveda’s total funding to $360 million. The funding will help the company with advancing its pipeline of ten development drug candidates. Enveda is building an AI-powered platform called a “sequencer” “that combines metabolomics data with machine learning and high-throughput biological experiments to answer two fundamental questions of any natural sample at scale: (1) What are the molecules?, and (2) What do they do?,” the company said. “Some of the world’s greatest pharmaceutical breakthroughs have been derived from just 0.1% of nature’s chemistry,” Viswa Colluru, chief executive of Enveda, said in a statement. “We developed our platform to rapidly expand access to nature’s chemistry to find therapeutics at roughly four times the speed–and it’s already delivering results in the form of a deep and differentiated pipeline. This funding will help us advance multiple candidates to exciting clinical catalysts in the next year, confirming our guiding vision that life’s chemistry is an excellent source for new medicines.” Pickle Robot, which develops robotic automation systems for unloading trucks, announced a $50 million Series B funding round this week. The company, which calls itself a pioneer of physical AI, also announced that six customers have ordered over 30 production robots in the third quarter for deployment in early 2025. Pickle Robot’s physical AI technology combines a vision system with generative AI foundation models trained on millions of real logistics and warehouse operations data. “Pickle Robot customers are experiencing the value of Physical AI applied to a common logistics process that challenges thousands of operations every day,” AJ Meyer, chief executive and founder of Pickle Robot, said in a statement. “The new funding and our strategic customer relationships enable Pickle to chart the future of supply chain robotics, rapidly expand our core product capabilities, and grow our business to deliver tremendous customer value now and in the future.” Lightning AI, the company behind the PyTorch Lightning deep learning framework, announced a $50 million equity investment this week that included Nvidia (NVDA) and J.P. Morgan (JPM). PyTorch Lightning has received over 160 million downloads since Lightning AI launched a year ago. Lightning AI combines dozens of separate AI development tools on one, multi-cloud platform where developers can build, train, and deploy AI models, and host AI apps securely. “Building your own AI platform today is like building your own Slack — it’s complex, costly, and not core to your business,” William Falcon, founder and chief executive of Lightning AI, said in a statement. “The value for enterprises lies in their data, domain knowledge, and unique models — not in maintaining AI infrastructure. We have thousands of developers single-handedly training and deploying models at a scale that would have required teams of developers without Lightning.” Thoughtful AI launched its specialized AI agents for revenue cycle management in healthcare this week. The AI-powered revenue cycle transformation company’s new agents include CODY for coding and notes review, and CAM for claims processing. “Our team of AI Agents turn RCM from a bottleneck into a powerhouse, using AI and automation to tackle tedious, time-consuming tasks so that healthcare teams can optimize revenue and focus on what matters most – patients,” Alex Zekoff, co-founder and chief executive of Thoughtful AI, said in a statement. Reforged Labs, an AI-powered video creation service for mobile game studios, launched its AI-powered video ad service this week that it says can deliver tailored, cost-effective ads in less than 24 hours. The startup’s proprietary AI engine was trained with thousands of game ads, Reforged Labs said. “We want to help level the playing field for game studios with limited resources,” Robert Huynh, chief executive and co-founder of Reforged Labs, said in a statement. “With our full-service creative solution that’s tailored for game marketing, studios can benefit from proven ad templates and AI-driven production and editing, all without lengthy briefs or big budgets.”
