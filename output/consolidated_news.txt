Ethereum (ETH) is poised for a resurgence in 2025 as it rides a wave of emerging trends to capitalize on a $100 trillion opportunity in tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), according to a letter shared with investors by Bitwise’s senior investment strategist, Juan Leon. The document highlighted that the crypto market was marked by two narratives this year: Bitcoin’s (BTC) new all-time high, driven by spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) approval in the US, and Solana’s (SOL) meteoric popularity as retail investors piled into memecoin speculation. As a result, Ethereum’s 66% year-to-date return paled when compared to BTC’s 130% gain and SOL’s 106% rally. However, recent signs suggest a reversal of sentiment. Over the past 10 days, Ethereum ETFs have attracted a staggering $2 billion in net inflows, eight times the $250 million net inflows recorded in the preceding four months. On Dec. 5, data from Farside Investors pointed out that the spot Ethereum ETFs traded in the US registered $428.5 million in inflows, a new daily record propelled by $292.7 million directed at BlackRock’s ETHA. Moreover, Ethereum ETFs saw less than three-digit daily inflows in only 3 out of the 10 past trading days saw inflows. This surge indicates that institutional and retail investors are warming up to Ethereum again. The tokenization of real-world assets might be the fuel for Ethereum’s resurgence. This process involves digitizing traditional assets — such as Treasury bills, real estate, and commodities — into blockchain-based tokens, offering faster, cheaper, and more efficient trading and settlement. Tokenization is no longer a far-off dream. Major players like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and UBS have adopted blockchain technology to tokenize RWAs. BlackRock’s tokenized treasury fund, BUIDL, currently has a market cap of $544 million. According to the letter, real-world assets are valued at roughly $100 trillion globally, creating a staggering opportunity. While it could take decades for significant portions of this market to shift to blockchain rails, Leon sees immense potential upside. Considering that Ethereum holds 81% of the RWA market, Leon estimates that fees generated from RWA-linked activity on Ethereum could ultimately surpass $100 billion annually, more than 40 times the network’s $2.4 billion in fees year-to-date. The letter attributes Ethereum’s dominance to its status as the most reliable and decentralized smart contract platform, secured by its long history of supporting decentralized applications and its vast distributed validator network. As the world’s largest asset managers explore tokenized assets, Ethereum remains the “battle-tested” standard. Furthermore, regulatory tailwinds could accelerate this transformation, setting Ethereum for potentially explosive growth. The letter noted that an increasingly pro-crypto U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may provide much-needed clarity, removing barriers to adoption and institutional participation.

Management and staff representatives at the Becton Dickenson (BD) plant in Drogheda have reached agreement on redundancy terms more than five months after it was announced the facility is to close. The final deal is understood to provide for staff to receive six weeks of pay per year of service capped at two years’ pay in addition to their statutory entitlements. There are also to be service recognition payments of €3,000 per year for those working for the company for more than 17⅓ years as well as payments to cover the loss of benefits like health insurance and orderly wind down payments linked to productivity. Almost 200 people currently work at the plant which opened in 1964. The decision to close it was taken by the company after an international supply chain review. About 110 people will leave in March of next year with the rest staying on until the scheduled closure in September 2026. Plant manager Catherina McGuirk said the decision to close had been “extremely difficult” but that “the agreement recognises the commitment and hard work that every employee has given to BD over the years and gives our employees the clarity they need to plan for the future as we all move forward.” She said that with agreement now in place, the company would seek to take steps to ensure it leaves a last positive legacy in Drogheda. Mike Fairbourn, BD’s general manager across the UK and Ireland said the company would work with government agencies and others to seek a new owner for the plant. “I am very aware of the impact this has had on our employees and the local community,” he said. “This is why BD has committed to work collaboratively with the IDA and local officials to secure a new owner for the facility. This would mean that the site can remain as a contributor to Drogheda’s economic growth, as well as a potential source of employment. Siptu sector organiser, Andrea Cleere, welcomed the agreement with the company which was reached after talks between management, unions and other staff representatives at the Workplace Relations Commission. “The acceptance by our members of these redundancy terms has brought clarity concerning the conclusion of their employment with Becton Dickinson and will now allow them to plan for their future,” she said. She said some of those scheduled to leave in March had already secured new employment to commence in the period afterwards. The medical devices multinational continues to operate other facilities at Enniscorthy, Limerick and Blackrock in Dublin.

Title: Is Salesforce (CRM) Betting on Agentforce to Drive Growth?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch: Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other top AI stocks to watch. Former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever recently claimed that a major change is on the horizon of artificial intelligence. Accepting a "Test Of Time" award for his 2014 paper with Oriol Vinyals and Quoc Le on Friday, December 13, he claimed that reasoning capabilities will make the technology far less predictable. He discussed how an idea his team had explored a decade ago regarding scaling data to new heights for pre-training AI systems, has begun to reach its limits. As such, more data and computing power had resulted in ChatGPT which OpenAI launched in 2022. "But pre-training as we know it will unquestionably end. While compute is growing, the data is not growing, because we have but one internet”. READ ALSO: 10 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm Speaking of its limits, Sutskever also proposed some ways of breaking new ground, such as technology itself generating new data, or AI models evaluating multiple answers before choosing the best response for a user, to improve accuracy. He further went on to predict a future of super-intelligent, self-aware AI capable of reasoning like humans, forecasting that the long-awaited AI agents will eventually become a reality in this advanced era. As such, AI leaders are now hinting that the generative AI revolution is entering a new phase, with advanced foundation models poised to bring reasoning and long-term thinking to AI capabilities. “We’re in the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And we’re at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are able to do reasoning and able to do long thinking.” Long thinking enables AI models to take more time to “think over” the results they generate for us, and are an effort to bring AI into System 2. System 2, a term popularized by Daniel Kahneman in his book “Thinking, Fast and Slow”, represents a mode of thinking that is slow, deliberate, analytical, and demanding conscious effort. As these capabilities develop further, AI is expected to move beyond its current applications in different sectors to intensely impact fields like medicine, research, and education, as evidenced by OpenAI’s recent advancements and their practical benefits in accelerating scientific discovery. “We’re going to have AI systems that can talk more fluently with us, that can also visualize the real world. And this combination of reasoning and multimodal capabilities, I think, is going to enable us to build more powerful agentic applications next year.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer service team in an office setting using the company's Customer 360 platform to communicate with customers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 116 Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is a cloud-based CRM company that has gained significant traction after the launch of its AI-powered platform called Agentforce. On December 12, Macquarie analyst Steve Koenig initiated coverage of Salesforce with a “Neutral” rating and a $370 price target. The analyst told investors in a research note that Salesforce CEO and founder Marc Benioff is aiming to position the company as a “digital labor” pioneer with the new Agentforce product. The move strives to target growth as share gains stall and the company faces slowing momentum. Even though there is excitement and interest around Agentforce, there may be some challenges, the analyst noted. In particular, the consumption-based pricing model of Gen AI functionality could disrupt Salesforce's current seat-based revenue model. In addition, Salesforce’s sequential revenue additions have been declining for three years, a key concern for the firm. As such, meeting market expectations requires a turnaround. Overall, CRM ranks 3rd on our list of top 10 AI Stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

iStockphoto The recent series of UFO and drone sightings across the United States, especially in the Northeast, has law enforcement and American citizens on high alert. That includes the New York Police Department (NYPD), which recently experienced their own strange story involving a large, mysterious drone. According to a New York Post report and a video shared on social media, the New York Police Department came into possession of this large, mysterious drone after an email tip. The drone, which appears to measure approximately six-feet in diameter, was reportedly discovered by the NYPD on the sidewalk at Fifth Street between Market Street and Morris Avenue in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. As officers were investigating, a passer-by said he worked in the building that houses the headquarters of the drone’s manufacturer — which he identified as Amogy Inc., a sustainable energy startup working to use ammonia as a renewable fuel source, including for aerial vehicles. Amogy CEO Seonghoon Woo would later tell police, according to New York Post sources, that the drone was owned by his company. He also reportedly claimed that the drone was inoperable and had been placed on the sidewalk after a company party about a month ago. An Amogy spokesperson told the New York Post that the drone was used in a demonstration of its clean energy technology three years ago. The spokesperson also added, “NYPD took possession of it for a brief period. Amogy cooperated fully with NYPD and the drone has since been returned to the company after NYPD determined the drone was not a threat.” According to the X (Twitter) account, @ShadowofEzra, BlackRock – the world’s largest asset manager – is one of Amogy’s investors. Other investors in the research and product development company include Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, AP Ventures, SK Innovation, and Aramco Ventures.

You can’t make this stuff up.” “I wouldn’t be surprised if these are Chinese spy craft like the spy balloon a couple years ago which the Biden administration at first denied even existing, then said it posed no threat and finally admitted what it was before a symbolic destruction of it after it had fully completed its mission of collecting and electronically sending photos and data back to Beijing,” another person commented. “‘Hey, let’s just throw a commercial drone in the street to make people believe that they aren’t the government’s drones they’re seeing. We’ll let someone find it and then have the police take pictures with it thinking they’ve cracked the mystery,'” someone else wrote on X sarcastically. “Not one single person believes this was left on a sidewalk a month ago. NOT ONE!” read another comment.

Title: Indiana Fund Narrows Finalists to Replace BlackRock

The Indiana Public Retirement System has identified State Street, Northern Trust and UBS Asset Management as potential replacements for BlackRock as manager of a $969 million global fixed-income portfolio, INPRS staff said during a December 13 board meeting. Indiana law, passed in May, requires state pension funds to replace a manager or service provider if the firm is determined to have made “ESG commitments,” defined as actions taken or factors considered “with the nonfinancial purpose” related to environmental, social or governance issues. If a manager or service provider is determined to have made an ESG commitment, then the board of INPRS must replace them with a comparable firm if one is available. If there is at least one service provider expected to be materially equivalent or materially better financially for the system, then the comparable firm must be chosen. On June 21, Indiana State Treasurer Dan Elliott determined that BlackRock Inc. was engaged in an ESG commitment, citing BlackRock’s Form 10-K filing that referenced ESG risks and the firm’s status as a signatory to the Net Zero Asset Management Initiative, a group of 325 managers representing $57.5 trillion in assets that support investing aligned to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  Following the treasurer’s finding, INPRS issued on June 28 a request for proposals for potential replacements. The BlackRock portfolio eligible for replacement is a passive global inflation-linked bond portfolio. “It’s a portfolio that, frankly, in my opinion, is not even ESG-related, because it’s a global fixed-income portfolio,” said one INPRS staff member in the December 13 meeting. INPRS staff and the fund’s investment consultant, Verus, determined State Street, UBS and Northern Trust to be comparable to BlackRock, following the RFP process. “They all have over $1 trillion in assets, [and] they all have passive fixed-income assets greater than $90 billion,” an INPRS staff member said in the meeting. Like BlackRock, State Street, Northern Trust and UBS are all members of the Net Zero Asset Owner Initiative. Firms like State Street have also been placed on watchlists and have been scrutinized for ESG commitments. The board of INPRS made a unanimous decision to confirm those three firms as comparable vendors. A provider selection is due within 180 days of the RFP, which puts the deadline as December 25. INPRS staff at the board meeting noted that there were no concerns with BlackRock’s investment performance, but BlackRock’s status as engaged in an ESG commitment dictated the change. “We’re proud of having helped hundreds of thousands of Indianans invest and retire with dignity. Despite this decision, we remain committed to Indiana and the $102 billion we have invested in the state on behalf of our clients,” a spokesperson for BlackRock said in a statement. INPRS manages $46 billion in assets for more than 529,000 beneficiaries.

Title: CFOs Are Paid More, But Have Less Job Security

Plus: Signet Jewelers CFO Talks About Her Strategy To Boost Top Line Growth, Rate Cut Is Likely This Week, SoftBank Makes Huge U.S. Investment Pledge, A Tax Deductible Executive Security Plan The CFO’s role is becoming more important to the company overall. In recent years, CFOs have played a more active role in creating strategy for the company overall, not just tallying up the funds but devising new programs, structures and tech investment plans to help the company’s bottom line. A new study from Datarails finds that average CFOs are becoming better compensated for their work. The average CFO salary, from an analysis of SEC filings for 1,657 publicly traded U.S. companies, was $3.8 million in 2023, up 9% from 2022 and one of the highest in the C-suite. CEOs and CTOs are the only positions that make more, with the average CTO salary only slightly more at $3.9 million. But the CFO also has the worst job security in the C-suite. In the last five years, the average CFO was at a company for only 3.1 of them. Datarails found that 48% of the companies it included in the study—771—had at least one CFO turnover in the last five years. Twenty-two had four CFOs in five years, while 152 had three. Breaking it down by industry, the average utility company CFO is there just over two and a half years. “The CFO position has become less a destination and more a crucible,” the report says. “Success can launch careers to new heights.” And that is true for some: The report found 15 CFOs who were promoted to CEO at their company in 2023. And, the report says, this underscores the new power of the CFO’s position. While it can have tenuous security, it’s a real opportunity for leaders to be forged, proving their acumen in both finance and strategy, and eventually rising to the top. Joan Hilson, chief finance and operating officer of Signet Jewelers, knows all about building strategy to drive better operations and sales. After coming to the world’s largest diamond retail company in 2019 as part of a strategic overhaul, she reformulated the financial and operational arm of the company to operate better in today’s consumer reality. I talked to her about these moves, and an excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Forbes CFO will be taking time off for the holiday season. This is our last newsletter of 2024. We’ll be back in your inbox on Tuesday, January 7. Happy holidays! The Eccles Building in Washington, D.C., where the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee are headquartered. In the run-up to the last Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting of the year, which begins today, indicators have been mixed. Inflation remains sticky, with last month’s consumer prices 2.7% above where they were in November 2023, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics last month. Core inflation—excluding food and energy costs—was 3.3% higher than a year ago. The CPI met analysts’ expectations, though it’s a tenth of a percentage point higher than October’s 2.6% inflation rate—but both are above the 2% Federal Reserve target. These figures show a high likelihood that the Fed will cut its target interest rate for the third straight time since September. According to CME FedWatch, 97% of economists predict a quarter percentage point cut, down to 4.25%. While the rate cut trend has continued, Forbes senior contributor Simon Moore writes that in 2025, the trend may slow down, especially if inflation doesn’t start coming down more. Inflation is only one piece of the puzzle—job growth and the overall economy are also taken into account—but persistent inflation held interest rates at the two-decade high of 5.25% for more than a year. The stock market had a big week as well, with the Nasdaq composite exceeding 20,000 for the first time ever on Wednesday. The inflation report, as well as big tech stocks and AI confidence, buoyed the market rally, and the index again exceeded 20,000 on Tuesday morning. But all companies did not have a good week. Chipmaker Nvidia found itself in correction territory Monday, posting a more than 1.6% loss—11% below its all-time closing high of $149 on November 7. While nothing new happened with Nvidia on Monday, the continued dip may be residual hesitancy based on Chinese authorities announcing last week an antitrust investigation into Nvidia for issues stemming from its 2020 acquisition of Israel’s Mellanox Technologies, writes Forbes senior contributor Dan Runkevicius. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son delivers remarks alongside President-elect Donald Trump and his choice for Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. Japan’s SoftBank announced a huge investment in the U.S. on Monday. At a joint event with President-elect Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son announced the tech funder would invest $100 billion in the United States over the next four years, doubling the $50 billion investment SoftBank made during Trump’s first term. Son said the investment will bring about 100,000 jobs in AI and related industries to the U.S. “President Trump is a double down president, I’m going to have to double down,” Son said at the joint press conference. However, Forbes’ Richard Nieva notes there could be an issue with that commitment: SoftBank doesn’t have $100 billion right now. Its market cap is close—$97 billion as of Monday, Nieva writes—and the commitment is for investments over four years, meaning there is time for SoftBank’s funds to grow. SoftBank’s commitment comes on the heels of many Big Tech executives kowtowing to the president-elect—and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman all announcing $1 million donations to Trump’s inaugural fund. Police place bullet casing markers outside the hotel in New York City after United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot December 4. Since the shooting death earlier this month of United HealthCare CEO Brian Thompson as he walked into the annual Investor Day meeting in New York City, C-suites and boardrooms have been buzzing about executive security. While some companies have taken immediate measures like removing executive pictures and profiles from their websites, others are beginning to look at actual security details to protect the executives—something that just over a quarter currently have. But executive security is a costly proposition. Last year, Apple spent $820,300 on personal security for CEO Tim Cook, as well as $1.6 million on his private aircraft travel, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. However, she writes, there are ways for companies to get tax breaks on executive security. According to tax law, essential security measures for an executive—those provided in response to “bona fide business-oriented security concerns” that are provided as part of a plan pursuant to independent security studies—can be deducted by the company. (The SEC considers executive security to be reportable compensation, so they are disclosed.) Signet Jewelers Chief Financial and Operating Officer Joan Hilson. The fine jewelry industry has seen big changes recently, and Joan Hilson has been there to lead the way. Since 2019, she’s been CFO of Signet Jewelers, the world’s largest diamond jewelry retailer that is the parent company of Kay Jewelers, Jared, Zales, Blue Nile and Banter by Piercing Pagoda. She was recently promoted to chief financial and operating officer. I spoke to Hilson about how Signet Jewelers’ new strategies, both before and since the Covid-19 pandemic, have helped the company cut costs and increase sales. This conversation has been edited for length, continuity and clarity. A longer version is available here. When you first came to Signet in 2019, you focused on restructuring the finance department. Why was this important, and how did you do it? Hilson: I joined Signet in 2019, as we were working to transform the overall company. The transformation was cultural, strategic and, at its core, financial. My job was to link arms with our [then-]CEO Gina Drosos and the senior leadership team to be one of the key drivers and an architect of our future growth plans. When I came in as CFO, Gina started to disassemble some of the top-down culture that needed to change. I was excited to dig into the financial side, the forecasting, and bring goals and an understanding of those goals to the team so that they can realize what we needed to achieve to drive a strong framework for our future. We rolled out [strategic plan] “Path to Brilliance” in 2018, and because of the progress we made on those goals, we accelerat[ed] to the “Inspiring Brilliance” strategy, which focused on enhanced capabilities. One of the things that I focused on as the financial leader of the company was: What do we need to do to drive top line growth and recognize that our banners span 80% of U.S. jewelry customers. By focusing on our core banners, we can drive that top line growth, which was critical to our strategies. We also focused on expanding our operating margins. That came along with developing a high-margin jewelry services business, which can take care of all of our customer needs, in terms of love and care for their jewelry. Along with that, we focused on a cost-savings initiative that drove out costs over $900 million since 2019. We did that by not just focusing on cutting costs that the customer doesn’t see or care about, but by changing processes and understanding how to simplify and what’s important to the overall growth of our business. Those efficiencies included the labor scheduling model we have in our stores. We have over 2,500 stores. With investments in data and analytics, we were able to bring forward labor scheduling models that enabled the strongest jewelry consultants to be in the stores at peak hours. We were able to look at locations by hour and by jewelry consultant to understand the best productivity opportunities. Our sales per labor hour is a key metric. [It] was up more than 40% versus pre-pandemic. It was a huge improvement in leveraging analytics and labor scheduling to serve our customers ultimately in a better way. The next big focus was our real estate strategy. Over my tenure, we closed over 1,000 stores. We did reopen stores in optimal locations for our business, but the net was a 630 [store] closure. It improved our gross margin leverage by 400 basis points by optimizing our fleet and then putting stores in the right locations within markets. We also moved from in-mall to off-mall to better serve some of the smaller markets in the U.S. While doing that, the savings that we were able to achieve we invest[ed] in our digital capabilities. With this change, we were able to grow our e-commerce business significantly over the five years from 2019. We went from 5% penetration to 20% penetration. We brought Signet into the digital and technology world and proved that jewelry and high-price-point items can be purchased online. In general, consumer spending across many categories has been down for about the last year and a half. How has Signet made it through that? We have a value-oriented consumer and they are looking for a value in whatever they purchase. We brought an assortment that can speak to the different economic circumstances of our customers. We have a portfolio that spans from Banter by Piercing Pagoda to Diamonds Direct and Blue Nile at the accessible luxury end of our business.

Title: Google joins $90M investment into Cassava to bolster Africa's digital infrastructure | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us With cloud spend continuing to surge, tech companies are scrambling to meet demand for the necessary infrastructure, with the growing need for AI compute only adding fuel to the fire. By way of example, Microsoft and BlackRock have created a $30 billion fund to support new data centers and energy infrastructure for the burgeoning AI boom, and Meta is planning a new $10 billion subsea cable that will span the entire globe. Google, for its part, recently announced Umoja, the first subsea fiber-optic cable to connect Africa and Australia — and it’s joining a $90 million funding round into Cassava Technologies, one of the partner companies involved in the Umoja project. With its first African data center operational for a year, among other infrastructure projects such as the Equiano subsea cable, Google confirmed to TechCrunch that it’s now taking a direct equity stake in Cassava, though it didn’t provide comment on the rationale behind the investment. However, it’s clear that it’s looking to improve infrastructure across the continent. Indeed, Africa has been hit by widespread outages throughout 2024, which have been attributed to faulty undersea cables, so it makes sense that Google would want to fund efforts to bolster connectivity for consumers and businesses that might want to use its services. Cassava announced $310 million in funding overall, though $220 million of that is in the form of a credit facility for one of its subsidiaries. The $90 million equity tranche included investments from the U.S. federal government’s International Development Finance Corporation (DFC); Finnish development finance company Finnfund; and Google itself. The funding will help Cassava: “… strengthen its balance sheet, drive sustainable profitable growth, and cement its position as a global technology company of African heritage,” according to a press release that also detailed a broader reorganization of the company. “It’s a pivotal milestone that we expect to unlock immense value and catalyze the further expansion of our digital infrastructure and services to bridge the digital divide on the continent,” Cassava CEO and President Hardy Pemhiwa (pictured above) said. African telecommunication company Econet spun out Cassava in 2021, serving as a standalone business for Econet’s various digital services and infrastructure initiatives spanning data centers, fiber broadband networks, renewable energy, cloud, cybersecurity, and more. Although Africa is a major focal point for Cassava, it also operates across other “key growth markets” including the Middle East, India, and Latin America. Among its business units is Liquid Intelligent Technologies, which worked with Google to build the terrestrial segment of Umoja; the cable starts in Kenya, and snakes through the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, before concluding its land journey in South Africa. Separately, another of Cassava’s business units, Liquid C2, this year announced a partnership with Google and Anthropic to bring “advanced cloud, cybersecurity solutions, and generative AI” services to companies across Africa. This constituted part of Google’s previous commitment to invest $1 billion in Africa’s digital economy. “Businesses are increasingly turning to generative AI to drive operational efficiencies, improve the customer experience, and empower their employees like never before,” Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said of its partnership with Liquid C2 at the time. “This partnership has the opportunity to transform how African businesses serve and engage their customers as we provide them a foundation for innovation.” Topics Senior Reporter ‘It’s dumb to IPO this year’: Databricks CEO explains why he’s waiting to go public Insight VC describes Databricks’ wild $10B deal and the bad advice the CEO ignored Bob Lee verdict: Cash App creator’s killer found guilty of second-degree murder This fintech processed $1B in payments through word-of-mouth Grammarly acquires productivity startup Coda, brings on new CEO Databricks raises $10B as it barrels toward an IPO 56 US startups have become unicorns so far in 2024: Here’s the full list Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

Title: Weight loss drugs are getting people to the doctor. Now comes the wave of long-ignored diagnoses

Time Published: 2024-12-17T16:15:00Z

Popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound are boosting the use of healthcare in the U.S., leading to an uptick in patients getting diagnosed and starting prescriptions for other conditions, according to a new analysis by health data firm Truveta. The firm analyzed thousands of electronic patient records between 2020 and 2024 and found a noticeable bump in first-time diagnoses of sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes just days after a patient started a prescription for a GLP-1 weight-loss drug. These drugs are bringing people who previously avoided medical care into the doctor’s office. In partnership with Truveta, Reuters interviewed a number of patients and physicians who said that some overweight patients seeking GLP-1s treatments have been hesitant to visit a doctor or go in for routine tests for years due to “stigma and bias they often encounter.” Because of this, once they do finally go to a doctor seeking a GLP-1 prescription these patients also end up getting diagnosed with other obesity-related conditions. Truveta researchers found that for every 1,000 patients with a first-time GLP-1 prescription in 2024, 42 ended up getting diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within 15 days, compared with 32 in 2020. During the same period, the number of sleep apnea diagnoses per 1,000 patients rose to 11 from 8, while the number of cardiovascular disease diagnoses jumped to 15 from 13. Even a medical device maker attributed their revenue growth this year in part to the rise of GLP-1 drugs. ResMed (RMD-3.52%), a seller sleep of apnea devices, said its revenue rose 11% during its fiscal year ending in June. The company’s CEO, Michael Farrell, told investors in a recent meeting that GLP-1 drugs are “bringing people into primary care like never before.” GLP-1 medications are a class of drugs, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-0.16%) diabetes drug Ozempic, that mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Popular brands on the market also include Ozempic’s sister drug Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s (LLY-0.37%) Zepbound. Soaring demand for these meds has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into the largest pharma companies in the world.

Title: Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq slide as Fed kicks off two-day policy meeting

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks fell on Tuesday despite upbeat retail sales data as the Federal Reserve kicked off its two-day policy meeting expected to usher in an interest-rate cut. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slid roughly 0.7%, coming off an eighth straight day of losses for the blue-chip index. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped around 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also lost about 0.5% after the tech-heavy index closed at a record high on Monday. Markets are waiting for Fed policymakers to kick off their final gathering of the year, amid almost total conviction that a 0.25% rate cut is coming on Wednesday. Some on Wall Street suspect it could be the last cut for some time, as inflation proves persistent. Given that, the focus is on clues to the path of rates next year — and in January, in particular. In the meantime, investors assessed a November reading on retail sales for insight into the health of the consumer and the economy. Sales rose 0.7%, faster than the 0.6% month-on-month gain expected, amid strong holiday spending. Eyes are also on Nvidia (NVDA), down more than 10% from its November record close. The chip giant's shares fell over 2% in late morning trade. Elsewhere, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices extended their rally to briefly break above $108,000 a token. Nvidia (NVDA) stock continued to slide on Tuesday after shares fell more than 10% from a November record close. The chip giant's stock dropped nearly 3% in early trade. The moves echoed a decline across all three major indexes, which have taken a breather as investors debate what could happen to the US economy in 2025. "This rally, which has been really dramatic since July, is starting to look a little bit vulnerable," James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief. "So going into 2025, I think investors should start to prepare themselves emotionally for a normal correction of 8% to 12% in markets," he cautioned. Demmert, who said the Federal Reserve "is probably already at the neutral rate" and likely won't need to cut interest rates much more from here, also touched on market breadth in the new year after the rapid rise in mega-cap Big Tech stocks. According to the latest Bank of America Fund Manager Survey, "long Magnificent 7 is considered the most crowded trade" per 57% of surveyed investors. "It's been such a Mag 7 market," Demmert said. "In 2025, we think those stocks do well, but other stuff will also do well or better" amid more attractive valuations and AI-driven use cases, which are expected to fuel earnings. Homebuilder confidence was flat in December from the previous month and came in lower than analyst estimates amid uncertainty over how quickly mortgage rates will decline. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index stayed at 46 in December, lower than economists’ estimates of 47, per Bloomberg data. Any reading under 50 indicates more builders view conditions as poor rather than good. “While builders are expressing concerns that high interest rates, elevated construction costs and a lack of buildable lots continue to act as headwinds, they are also anticipating future regulatory relief in the aftermath of the election,” NAHB chairman Carl Harris, a custom home builder from Wichita, Kan., said in a press statement “This is reflected in the fact that future sales expectations have increased to a nearly three-year high.” Mortgage rates have dropped for the last three consecutive weeks, with the average 30-year mortgage rate holding at 6.6%, according to Freddie Mac. There’s a growing expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at the conclusion of its meeting on Wednesday. The decrease has already been baked into current mortgage interest rates, so housing experts don’t expect mortgage rates to drop further. NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz writes: "Concerns over inflation risks in 2025 will keep long-term interest rates, like mortgage rates, near current levels with mortgage rates remaining above 6%.” US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors look ahead to the start of the last Federal Reserve policy meeting of the year, with all bets pointing to a 25 basis point interest-rate cut. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slid roughly 0.5%, coming off an eighth straight day of losses for the blue-chip index. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also lost about 0.5%. The Nasdaq closed at a record high on Monday. November retail sales grew at a faster pace than Wall Street analysts had expected, reflecting continued resilience in the American consumer and indicating that the holiday shopping season in the US is off to a strong start. Retail sales rose 0.7% in November. Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in October were revised up to a 0.5% increase from a prior reading that showed a 0.4% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. A 2.4% month-over-month increase in motor vehicle and auto parts sales, as well as a 1.8% increase in online sales, drove the gains. November sales, excluding auto and gas, rose 0.2%, below consensus estimates for a 0.4% increase. The control group in Tuesday's release, which excludes several volatile categories and factors into the Gross Domestic Product reading for the quarter, increased by 0.4%, in line with estimates.

Title: My favourite VR headset from 2024 just got its first major price cut, and it's not the one you think

Just in time for Christmas - and you get three free games When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta Quest 3S and Apple Vision Pro sure have hogged the VR limelight this year, but there's another headset that I think you should know about if you're shopping for a new mixed-reality device this Christmas. The Pico 4 Ultra launched only a few months ago, and it has some specs that are even more powerful than the Meta Quest 3. I was scrolling through Christmas-time deals at Amazon today when I came across its first-ever major discount - to the tune of a £60 reduction. That means that for a limited time, you can get the Pico 4 Ultra for just £469 at Amazon, which is the same price as the 512GB Quest 3. Because this VR headset is so new, the discount isn't all you get. You can still make the most of the Pico 4 Ultra's launch bundle, which gets you three free games (try saying that a few times out loud) with your purchase for no extra cost. Those games are packing serious heat: Blade & Sorcery, Pistol Whip, and Synth Riders, as well as a one-month subscription to VRChat Plus. That's quite tempting versus the one free Batman game you get when buying the Quest 3. Pico 4 Ultra 256GB + 3 Free Games + VRC+ Subscription | £529 £469 at AmazonSave £60 - This is the first time that the Pico 4 Ultra has dropped in price since its launch earlier in the year. Its pre-order bonus offer is still available, which means you can get three free games with your purchase, two of which are Blade & Sorcery and Pistol Whip, which are two of the best VR games ever made in my opinion. Buy it if ✅ You want a powerful standalone VR headset✅ You want something that's better than the Meta Quest 3✅ You want to play on PC✅ You want three free games to get you started Don't buy it if: ❌ You'd prefer a Meta Quest headset❌ You already own a PS5 Now priced at the same level as the Meta Quest 3, the Pico 4 Ultra finds itself in a straight shootout. I've had the good fortune of reviewing both headsets and although both are plenty capable of giving you mixed reality goodness and VR gaming fun, there's one I'd probably choose over the other. Pico 4 Ultra has 12GB of RAM, more than the 8GB you get in the Meta Quest 3. In addition, it has a really lightweight feel on your head because the head strap you get out of the box is a bit more substantial than the stock one Meta gives you. This spreads the weight a bit better, meaning it's more comfortable to wear for longer sessions. One of my biggest concerns with Pico's OS was that it might have a smaller library of games than the popular Quest options. While that is true, I was surprised that the 4 Ultra still had access to lots of great titles, and many of the best VR games are present. In standalone mode, the Pico 4 Ultra uses the same processor as the Quest 3, the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2, but with its beefier memory, larger battery, faster Wi-Fi, and crystal clear frontal cameras, I'd probably pick the Pico 4 Ultra. You may think the opposite is true when you consider the Quest 3's increased 512GB storage or slightly wider field of view, but I'd disagree. Memory makes more of a difference to gaming performance in a VR headset, and a longer battery life will be a big factor for you. VR games are bizarely small in terms of storage sizes, and in over a year of owning my Quest 3, I've not come close to filling up its 512GB drive. Of course, if you're on a budget, you might want to opt for the cheapest alternative, which will be the Meta Quest 3S. It also shares the same chipset as the headsets above, although does cut some corners with other internal specs. Still, it only costs £299, so if you need to keep costs down at this time of year (I wouldn't blame you), that headset might suit you better.

Title: DeFi Meets Traditional Finance: Zoth and Singularity Finance's New Treasury Management Solution | HackerNoon

Time Published: 2024-12-17T15:43:49Z

Zoth and Singularity Finance announced their collaboration on December 17, 2024, launching ZTLN Prime (ZTLN-P), a tokenized investment product that bridges traditional finance with blockchain technology. The product aims to provide institutional investors with access to U.S. Treasury ETFs and money market funds through blockchain infrastructure. ZTLN-P represents a shift in how institutions can manage treasury assets, combining traditional financial instruments with digital asset technology. The product is backed by Blackrock-managed iShares ETFs and money market funds, focusing on U.S. Treasury bills, which provides a foundation for stable returns in the digital asset space. The partnership leverages Singularity Finance's tokenization framework and Zoth's experience in bringing traditional financial instruments to blockchain networks. This combination addresses several key challenges in the digital asset space, particularly around regulatory compliance and liquidity management. The regulatory framework supporting ZTLN-P includes oversight from the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) and adherence to the Mutual Funds Act (2021 Revision). This regulatory structure provides institutional investors with familiar compliance frameworks while operating in the digital asset space. Doo Group serves as the custodian for the underlying assets, adding another layer of institutional infrastructure to the product. This custody arrangement demonstrates the project's focus on establishing traditional financial safeguards within the digital asset ecosystem. The significance of this launch extends beyond the immediate product offering. It represents a growing trend of bringing traditional financial instruments into the blockchain space, potentially opening new paths for institutional adoption of digital asset technology. Pritam Dutta, CEO of Zoth, emphasized the product's focus on institutional-grade investments, noting how it combines traditional treasury instruments with blockchain efficiency. Mario Casiraghi, Co-founder of SingularityDAO and Singularity Finance, highlighted the product's role in bridging traditional and decentralized finance. The launch also showcases Singularity Finance's broader strategy in the real-world asset (RWA) space. Cloris Chen, CEO at Singularity Finance, explained how ZTLN Prime fits into their ecosystem development plans, particularly in creating infrastructure for RWA projects. This development comes at a time when institutional interest in digital assets continues to evolve, with a growing focus on products that combine traditional financial stability with blockchain technology's efficiency. The partnership between Zoth and Singularity Finance demonstrates how companies are working to meet this institutional demand. Looking ahead, this collaboration could influence how other companies approach the integration of traditional financial products with blockchain technology. The focus on regulatory compliance, institutional-grade custody solutions, and traditional asset backing might set precedents for future developments in the space. The launch of ZTLN Prime also reflects the broader evolution of the digital asset industry, as it moves toward products that cater to institutional requirements while maintaining the benefits of blockchain technology. This balance between innovation and institutional standards could prove crucial for the industry's continued development. For institutional investors, ZTLN Prime offers a new option for treasury management that combines familiar assets with new technology. The product's structure suggests a potential template for future institutional-focused digital asset products, particularly in how they approach asset backing, regulatory compliance, and risk management. This development indicates a maturing digital asset ecosystem, where traditional financial products and blockchain technology can coexist within regulatory frameworks, potentially opening new opportunities for institutional participation in the digital asset space.

Title: AppLovin has rocketed to a $100 billion valuation. Some industry insiders are skeptical its run can last.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/applovin-meteoric-rise-some-advertisers-have-big-questions-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-17T15:43:04Z
Full Content:
Shares in the mobile ads and gaming company AppLovin have been running wild — and advertising industry insiders have a lot of questions. AppLovin entered the Nasdaq 100 in November, with its market value surpassing the $100 billion milestone and shares up more than 780% so far this year. It's a remarkable ascent for any company, but especially for one that had flown fairly under the radar until recently, even within the ad industry itself. At its current valuation, AppLovin dwarfs even The Trade Desk, long considered adtech's star performer, which has a market capitalization of around $65 billion. AppLovin — which helps app developers make money through advertising and find new users through ads — has grown its share to 42% of the mobile gaming market, per analysts at Piper Sandler. But there's one key new development that's driving its stunning stock run: e-commerce. Bullish analysts say AppLovin has room to grow further and do for e-commerce marketers what it has for gaming companies, taking on Meta in the process. "In all my years, it's the best product I've ever seen released by us, fastest growing, but it's still in pilot," AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi said of the company's new e-commerce product on an earnings call last month. With its stock riding high, some industry insiders also think AppLovin could make a transformative acquisition that would make it a household name. Still, others in the ad industry say AppLovin's business model deserves some skepticism amid its meteoric rise. 22V Research analyst John Roque wrote in a recent note that AppLovin was the most overbought stock in the Russell 3000. AppLovin declined to comment on a list of detailed questions about its business. Wall Street's interest in AppLovin soared this year as the company unveiled a plan to go after a new target customer outside the mobile gaming community: e-commerce advertisers. The move opened up a total addressable ad revenue opportunity of around $120 billion, two to three times the size of the $40 to $50 billion mobile games user acquisition market, according to Macquarie Equity senior analyst Tim Nollen. Nollen recently raised the firm's target share price for AppLovin to $450 from $270, citing its e-commerce push. Cody Pfloker, chief marketing and revenue officer for Jones Road Beauty, which is testing AppLovin, said direct-to-consumer advertisers are excited by the prospect of a new player in the market. "Meta has been the dominant customer acquisition channel for brands and while other platforms have come up like TikTok a few years ago, none are either as efficient or scalable," Pfloker said. "Nothing has been able to dethrone Meta." AppLovin says it can reach a potential audience of 1.4 billion daily active users across mobile apps and connected-TV devices — an audience comparable to Meta or Google's apps. Pfloker said part of the appeal is that e-commerce advertisers can easily repurpose their Meta ads into ads for AppLovin's mobile games and other apps. AppLovin is only inviting e-commerce advertisers that spend upward of $20,000 a day on Meta ads to try its product, and it's incentivizing some of those buyers with $10,000 ad credits, multiple industry insiders told BI. They, like some others in this story, requested anonymity to preserve business relationships; their identities are known to BI. Prescient AI, a marketing measurement company, ran an analysis in October that found AppLovin delivered a 1.5 times higher return on ad spend for its customers than Meta and Google Adwords, on average. "A pretty startling thing is happening," said Will Holtz, VP of strategy and operations at Prescient AI. The top spenders are spending 25% to 30% of their budgets on AppLovin, he said, something Prescient hasn't seen before on a new channel, except for something like TV where people bulk up spending over the holidays. What's more, Holtz added: "They're spending incremental dollars; they're not just shifting budget away from channels like Meta." It's worth noting that the ads are full-screen and can't be skipped, which also likely boosts some performance metrics compared to other platforms. The results are also early and could fluctuate as more advertisers come on board. Despite the enthusiasm from some customers, others in the digital ad community have raised concerns about AppLovin. Some industry insiders attribute AppLovin's performance to its cornering of every part of the mobile app ad transaction. AppLovin operates AppDiscovery, the technology that advertisers use to buy the ads; the MAX mediation technology developers use to sell their ads; and the ALX exchange that connects the two. It also has Adjust, its ad measurement platform, and AXON, an AI engine designed to improve the performance of its ads. This could give AppLovin a unique view of the market and allow it to see what different advertisers and buying platforms are bidding. Theoretically, AppLovin could use this intelligence to refine its own ad bidding strategies. "It's one company for monetizing your app, growing your userbase, and then grading its own homework," a mobile ad veteran told BI. "They say there's a firewall and 'we don't talk,' but it's hard to prove otherwise." If that sounds familiar, it's because it's similar to how people often describe the approach that helped Google dominate advertising on the web. A judge in Google's adtech antitrust trial is currently weighing whether that strategy, as well as its use of other auction tactics, amounted to Google operating an illegal monopoly. Google denies this and has said the adtech market is fiercely competitive and that its innovations have brought benefits to consumers, publishers, and advertisers. Jeromy Sonne, the founder of marketing AI technology company Simbiant, has been monitoring the early AppLovin e-commerce results. He said he'd seen an "extremely high correlation" between when AppLovin sees a spike in conversions and when Meta sees an increase in ad spend. He said he hadn't seen a similar trend when comparing Meta and Google or AppLovin and Google. He said that made him wonder if AppLovin was driving real incremental value or whether its campaigns were just reaching the exact same audience as Meta in some way. He said he'd also seen a "concerning overlap" where Shopify sales purportedly driven by AppLovin have a very high geographic overlap with where Meta ad website traffic was coming from. Separately, Prescient AI's analysis found that brands spending between 25% to 30% of their digital ad budgets on AppLovin acquired fewer incremental new customers than brands in the 5% to 10% range. While reacquiring some old customers isn't necessarily a bad thing, the finding raises questions about the appropriate level of spending advertisers should devote to AppLovin, Prescient AI's Holtz said. Other advertisers have questioned why AppLovin doesn't share granular data about exactly where their ads ran. "It's a little bit of a black box — we have no idea where our ads are appearing," Pfloker said of AppLovin. "There's a lot to be excited about, but there's a lot to be skeptical about." AppLovin recently paid more than $150 million to add developer Zynga's portfolio of games to its MAX ad exchange as part of Zynga's divestment of its adtech platform Chartboost, three people familiar with the matter told BI. This boosted AppLovin's already huge audience of gamers. A spokesperson for Zynga owner Take-Two declined to comment. Some in the industry think AppLovin could make an even bigger move. The company recently sold $3.5 billion in bonds, which Bloomberg reported were to pay down debt "and for general corporate purposes." Could that include an acquisition? Alex Merutka, an early AppLovin employee who now runs his own digital marketing company, Craftsman+, thinks AppLovin should make a bid for a social network — a particularly valuable sector of apps because users tend to be logged in, visit often, and share useful data. People who use mobile games don't usually hand over data like phone numbers or email addresses, vital pieces of information for marketers to help connect their ads to outcomes, and to retarget users with ads. AppLovin is already trading at a larger market capitalization than Snap, Pinterest, and Reddit combined. Years ago, Snap held informal, early-stage talks about potentially acquiring AppLovin, a person familiar with the matter told BI. Perhaps the roles could be reversed this time around. While Snap posted a revenue growth bounceback in its latest quarter, it's struggled to keep momentum amid fierce competition from the likes of TikTok. AppLovin could theoretically help optimize Snap's ad platform for performance advertisers to better compete with Google and Meta. "If Adam was in control, Snap could be a $100 billion business — a $200 billion, $300 billion company — and AppLovin would be stronger too," Merutka said, referring to AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi. "There's a lot of opportunity there." However, AppLovin execs said onstage at the Nasdaq Investor Conference earlier this month that M&A wasn't a near-term priority and that the company was keeping a close eye on its head count and margins. "It's much harder than people realize, and it's exceptionally hard for a company that's structured like us," Foroughi said of M&A and the difficulty of absorbing different company cultures, according to a transcript provided by the market intelligence platform AlphaSense.

Title: Buy, Sell, Or Hold Bitcoin?

Bitcoin logo is seen in this illustration photo taken in Warsaw, Poland on 05 December, 2024. ... [+] (Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The price of Bitcoin cryptocurrency (BTC) is likely headed to new highs in 2025 after surging nearly 150% in 2024. Currently trading at nearly $104,000, Bitcoin has eclipsed AI superstar Nvidia in the last 6 months with >55% returns while Nvidia stock barely moved (Sell Nvidia, Buy Intel Stock?). There are reasons to be excited about Bitcoin going into next year considering the political, administrative and market developments. Cryptocurrency has traditionally been regarded as a “speculative” asset with no real contribution to the economy. However, it’s hard to ignore its growing legitimacy, increased adoption, and demand. But, other opportunities exist, too. Up 40% in a week? See What’s Happening With Broadcom Stock? The OG cryptocurrency crossed $100,000 mark for the first time riding on support from the Donald Trump-led administration. In addition to a shift in regulatory view, notable institution adoption, broader ecosystem developments, limited availability, and global macroeconomic uncertainty could put Bitcoin above $150,000 by the end of 2025. But Bitcoin’s rise hasn’t been without its risks and accompanying volatility. If you want upside with a smoother ride than crypto, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Donald Trump’s evolving stance on Cryptocurrency bodes well for Bitcoin’s future. His view toward creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and a need for favorable cryptocurrency regulations, is re-vitalizing confidence in the Cryptocurrency. One item on Trump’s presidential campaign agenda was to create a strategic reserve for Bitcoin. While it’s still far from materializing, a concrete bill has already been proposed in the Senate. If passed, it would entitle the Treasury and the Fed to build a reserve of about 5% of the global Bitcoin supply within five years with the purpose of hedging against currency risk, lowering national debt, and supporting the country’s balance sheet. Historically skeptic SEC chair, Gary Gensler, has already decided to step down, which will likely pave the way for crypto-friendly regulations going forward. Moreover, Donald Trump’s team is contemplating creating a dedicated position in the White House to oversee and drive the blockchain ecosystem. These developments will likely work to mitigate risks of investing in a speculative asset, inviting more players into the market - and this is already happening. See What’s Behind The 500% Rise In RGTI Stock? Growing Institutional investor interest toward Bitcoin is very clear. Bitcoin ETFs have been the most popular in 2024 – a year that saw record new ETF launches. Blackrock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has already amassed AUM of $45bn + since its launch in January 2024. As of August 2024, Private Companies and ETFs controlled over 1.2 million units of Bitcoins representing 6.29% of the total supply of Bitcoins. In addition, the cryptocurrency’s holdings of publicly traded companies rose almost 200% year-on-year to ~$20 billion, as of mid-2024. Amid the prevailing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, Bitcoin is emerging as a lucrative investment option and a hedge against crashing fiat currencies especially in hyperinflationary environments such as in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Lebanon. In 2023, Bitcoins made up 9% of Venezuela’s remittances, with crypto adoption further picking up amid oil sanctions. Bitcoin can emerge as a viable hedging instrument for governments as well, with a possibility of central banks diversifying their asset pool with Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies. The U.S. and China are already headed that way with other countries likely to follow suit. The price surge is likely to get a boost from fixed supply and growing demand. This “scarcity” sets Bitcoins apart from conventional fiat currencies. There are only about 21 million coins in existence today, which is essentially all the bitcoins that have been mined. The rate at which new coins are mined drops around the halving events that happen every four years, with the most recent one in April 2024. When the reward to mine new Bitcoin is halved, fewer new coins are mined and added to the pool, thus limiting the supply and driving up prices. In fact, historical trends around halving events have shown a subsequent rise in Bitcoin prices. This year, the price has gone up over 50% since April. Back in April 2020, the price jumped 10x in the one year that followed. Though all the increase cannot be attributed to halving alone, its role is consequential. Since Bitcoin arguably still lacks any intrinsic value, it is susceptible to market sentiment which makes its price volatile. Three years ago, Bitcoin dropped almost 50% twice. First from March 2021 to June 21, and again from Nov 2021 to Jan 2022. Besides, with limited supply of units, the price is potentially open to manipulation by large institutional investors. Cybersecurity threats to stored bitcoins, and potential environmental impact related restrictions also add to the risks involved in this asset class. There have been numerous periods - such as 2018 and 2022 when bitcoin could not beat the S&P 500. In fact, consistently beating the broader markets — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks and even cryptocurrencies. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: 'Most clients are probably out of balance': BlackRock's stock chief says investors should consider this portfolio change in 2025

Buying an S&P 500 index fund has long been considered an easy way to gain broad market exposure and diversification. But these days, this is increasingly not the case, warns Tony DeSpirito, BlackRock's chief investment officer for US fundamental active equity and the lead portfolio manager of the BlackRock Equity Dividend portfolios. In the past, the largest sector in the S&P 500 has typically made up less than 20% of the index. Post-pandemic, that's changed as Big Tech companies' share prices have taken off. As the largest names in the index continue to grow in market capitalization, they've brought the index along with them and driven much of the overall market returns. These high concentration levels leave investors vulnerable to market fluctuations and risks such as a potential resurgence in inflation, which has historically hurt growth names, according to DeSpirito. "Most clients are probably out of balance. They've gotten growth tilted," DeSpirito told BI. "There's an opportunity to supplement it with value," he added. DeSpirito believes it would serve investors well to take a step back from growth and increase their allocation to value stocks in 2025. With flashy, fast-growing companies like the Magnificent Seven taking the spotlight in recent years, it's not hard to see why value has been pushed aside. Today's investors are hungry for growth stocks, which typically increase their profits at a quicker clip than value stocks, or those that trade at a lower price than intrinsic value and are priced below their peers. But investors who aren't actively seeking growth are still overexposed to it. Even before the Magnificent Seven's run-up, the stock market had been tilting towards growth for the last decade, as low interest rates made it more attractive for investors to bet on less-established stocks, according to Björn Jesch, chief investment officer of the asset manager DWS. These factors have created a highly concentrated market dominated by the technology sector, DeSpirito said. As a result, when investors buy the S&P 500 index, they become overexposed to growth by default. DeSpirito sees two main reasons why investors should start shifting away from growth. Concentration risk and persistent inflation significantly shaped markets in 2024, and DeSpirito believes they'll continue to do so in 2025. That's where value investing comes in, he said, as value stocks provide diversification on both fronts. Market concentration is at an all-time high, surpassing dot-com bubble levels by many measures. Today, the movements of just a few stocks — for example, Nvidia — can disproportionately impact the rest of the market. Exposure to value stocks can reduce that volatility and ensure that your portfolio performance isn't at the mercy of a single stock or sector: "Value stocks look a lot different from the Magnificent Seven," DeSpirito said. Historically, it's not been sustainable for market concentration to remain elevated for extended periods of time. Expect more stocks to contribute to the overall gains of the S&P 500 in 2025, DeSpirito predicted. Investors who diversify and add value stocks to their portfolio will benefit from the market broadening out beyond the Big Tech names. DeSpirito added that value stocks also have an impressive track record during inflationary periods. On the other hand, high valuation multiples tend to decline in response to elevated inflation, meaning that expensively priced growth stocks are more sensitive to inflation. Just look at 2022, when inflation surged to over 9% and central banks began to raise interest rates. The MSCI World Growth Index, which tracks large and mid-cap growth stocks, dropped almost 30% over the course of 2022, while the MSCI World Value Index only declined around 6% in the same time period. Investors looking to get exposure to value might decide to buy a broad value index, but DeSpirito cautions against that. The S&P 500 isn't the only index that's gotten growth-heavy: "Even when I look at value indices, they too have shifted more towards growth," DeSpirito said. "You really need to find an active manager who stuck to their value discipline," DeSpirito added. Investors can also take a sector approach to diversifying with value. "Value stocks are mainly found in the financial, healthcare, industrial, and energy sectors. Growth stocks are mainly found in the technology, consumer discretionary, and communication services sectors," Jesch wrote in a recent note. Examples of actively managed value funds include the iShares Large Cap Value Active ETF (BLCV), which DeSpirito manages, the T. Rowe Price Value ETF (TVAL), and the Avantis US Large Cap Value ETF (AVLV). Jump to

Title: What's Happening With Broadcom Stock?

SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 12: A sign is posted in front of a Broadcom office on December 12, ... [+] 2024 in San Jose, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO), a semiconductor, enterprise software, and security solutions provider, has seen its stock surge over 40% in a week. This can be attributed to better than expected earnings and outlook, followed by stock upgrades from some of the large Wall Street institutions. Also see, Buy, Sell, Or Hold Bitcoin? Broadcom recently reported its Q4 fiscal 2024 results (fiscal ends in October), with revenues of $14.05 billion and earnings of $1.42 per share, versus the consensus estimates of $14.09 billion and $1.38, respectively. Broadcom is seeing a stellar demand for its AI products, a trend expected to continue in the coming years. Let’s dive deeper into the company’s recent performance and the impact on its stock price. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Broadcom’s revenue of 14.05 billion in Q4 was up a stellar 51% y-o-y. This can partly be attributed to the contribution from VMware, which it acquired for $69 billion last year. Apart from VMware, Broadcom’s AI products contributed to its top-line growth. The company’s AI revenue in fiscal 2024 stood at $12.2 billion, reflecting a whopping 220% y-o-y growth, driven by strong demand for its AI XPUs (Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators) and Ethernet products. Broadcom is benefiting from the generative AI boom, with its wide suite of networking and storage solutions, cybersecurity, and semiconductor offerings. Broadcom also announced that it’s developing AI chips with three large cloud companies, which reportedly include Google and Meta. The company’s outlook of $14.6 billion in Q1 fiscal 2025 also reflects a strong 22% y-o-y growth. Not only did the company post strong revenues in Q4, its adjusted operating margin expanded 90 bps y-o-y to 62.7%. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in the bottom line of $1.42 on an adjusted basis, versus $1.11 in the prior-year quarter. Also, look at What's Behind The 500% Rise In RGTI Stock? Admirably, AVGO stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 4 years. Returns for the stock were 56% in 2021, -13% in 2022, 104% in 2023, and 104% so far this year. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Broadcom’s solid growth for its AI products and guidance prompted an upward revision for its stock price by several Wall Street analysts. That said, most of the estimates are now met, after a large 40% move seen in a week. At its current levels of $250, AVGO stock now trades at 23x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 5x over the last three years. Now, the company’s acquisition of VMware, the massive opportunity in generative AI with its chips, as well as networking products, and strong profitability does warrant a meaningful upward revision in valuation multiple. After its recent rally, AVGO has now become the eighth stock to exceed the $1 trillion market capitalization. Notably, the $226 average of analysts price estimate for AVGO stock implies that it’s now fully valued.

Title: What's Happening With Broadcom Stock?

SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 12: A sign is posted in front of a Broadcom office on December 12, ... [+] 2024 in San Jose, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO), a semiconductor, enterprise software, and security solutions provider, has seen its stock surge over 40% in a week. This can be attributed to better than expected earnings and outlook, followed by stock upgrades from some of the large Wall Street institutions. Also see, Buy, Sell, Or Hold Bitcoin? Broadcom recently reported its Q4 fiscal 2024 results (fiscal ends in October), with revenues of $14.05 billion and earnings of $1.42 per share, versus the consensus estimates of $14.09 billion and $1.38, respectively. Broadcom is seeing a stellar demand for its AI products, a trend expected to continue in the coming years. Let’s dive deeper into the company’s recent performance and the impact on its stock price. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Broadcom’s revenue of 14.05 billion in Q4 was up a stellar 51% y-o-y. This can partly be attributed to the contribution from VMware, which it acquired for $69 billion last year. Apart from VMware, Broadcom’s AI products contributed to its top-line growth. The company’s AI revenue in fiscal 2024 stood at $12.2 billion, reflecting a whopping 220% y-o-y growth, driven by strong demand for its AI XPUs (Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators) and Ethernet products. Broadcom is benefiting from the generative AI boom, with its wide suite of networking and storage solutions, cybersecurity, and semiconductor offerings. Broadcom also announced that it’s developing AI chips with three large cloud companies, which reportedly include Google and Meta. The company’s outlook of $14.6 billion in Q1 fiscal 2025 also reflects a strong 22% y-o-y growth. Not only did the company post strong revenues in Q4, its adjusted operating margin expanded 90 bps y-o-y to 62.7%. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in the bottom line of $1.42 on an adjusted basis, versus $1.11 in the prior-year quarter. Also, look at What's Behind The 500% Rise In RGTI Stock? Admirably, AVGO stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 4 years. Returns for the stock were 56% in 2021, -13% in 2022, 104% in 2023, and 104% so far this year. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Broadcom’s solid growth for its AI products and guidance prompted an upward revision for its stock price by several Wall Street analysts. That said, most of the estimates are now met, after a large 40% move seen in a week. At its current levels of $250, AVGO stock now trades at 23x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 5x over the last three years. Now, the company’s acquisition of VMware, the massive opportunity in generative AI with its chips, as well as networking products, and strong profitability does warrant a meaningful upward revision in valuation multiple. After its recent rally, AVGO has now become the eighth stock to exceed the $1 trillion market capitalization. Notably, the $226 average of analysts price estimate for AVGO stock implies that it’s now fully valued. While AVGO stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how Broadcom’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: 6 unique ways we advanced energy solutions in 2024

Time Published: 2024-12-17T14:00:00Z

[[read-time]] min read Highlighting some of the steps we took to build a smarter energy future this year. Demand for electricity is rising across the world, driven by the rapid growth of manufacturing and AI, electrification of buildings and transportation, and the ongoing digitalization of our economy and society. Meeting this growing demand is one of the key challenges of our time and an enormous opportunity to build a smarter energy system that benefits people everywhere. This year, we pursued a range of actions to procure more energy and drive new technological and market innovations — all with the aim of driving the systems change needed to meet growing electricity demand affordably, sustainably and reliably. Here are six unique ways ways we made progress in 2024: Operating on carbon-free energy every hour of the day requires technologies like geothermal and nuclear power that can fill gaps in wind and solar generation. But these technologies are often costly and existing markets do not incentivize their development. That’s why we partnered with NV Energy to propose a new clean transition rate that brings corporate buyers and utilities together to unlock new investments. This will make it easier to develop projects that deliver “clean, firm” capacity to the grid while ensuring their costs aren’t passed along to other electricity consumers. This model can be replicated in additional markets, starting with Duke Energy, where we signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to explore the development of a similar rate structure in their service territory. Bringing new clean energy online is particularly challenging in the Asia Pacific region, where wind and solar resources are not readily available in many markets. In addition to announcing long-term agreements for new clean energy capacity in the region, we partnered with BlackRock to develop a 1 GW pipeline of new solar capacity in Taiwan. Our investment in solar developer New Green Power will help meet Google’s electricity demand in Taiwan and allow us to offer some of this new capacity to our semiconductor suppliers and equipment manufacturers in the region. Through these nine projects in five countries across the region, this year we're proving it’s possible to turn challenges into opportunities in Asia Pacific. In addition to creating new mechanisms to accelerate advanced clean energy technologies, we are also supporting the companies developing these technologies and bringing them to market. Our new, first-of-its-kind partnership with Kairos Power will unlock up to 500 MW of new, clean power from a series of small modular nuclear reactors. Kairos Power’s passively safe system and iterative development approach will help bring down costs and ensure more communities can benefit from clean, reliable nuclear power. No company alone can advance new clean energy technologies at the speed and scale required to decarbonize global electricity systems. That’s why we launched a new initiative with Microsoft and Nucor to aggregate our demand for advanced, clean technologies like enhanced geothermal, long-duration energy storage, clean hydrogen, and advanced nuclear. These technologies are critical to achieving fully decarbonized, reliable electricity grids, but their early stage development requires significant upfront investment. By working together, large clean energy buyers can accelerate the investments and market innovations needed to scale these essential technologies. This year, we upscaled our first-of-its-kind process that dramatically accelerates the execution of power purchase agreements (PPAs) with clean energy developers. The results since we started using this process have been meaningful: we’ve signed contracts to purchase over 3.3 GW of new clean energy generation capacity across North America and Europe and we’ve cut the time required to negotiate and execute these PPAs by roughly 80%. We recently unveiled a novel strategic partnership with Intersect Power and TPG Rise Climate to co-locate data centers with new clean energy in the U.S. By thoughtfully building data center load next to new additional power generation where possible, we’ll reduce both the timeline to operation and the amount of new transmission required. This model is an important complement to efforts to unlock development of new transmission infrastructure and optimize utilization of the existing grid. While the diverse range of actions we’ve taken this year have helped advance the next generation of energy solutions, there’s much more to be done. As we build on this year’s momentum in the years to come, we will continue to refine our approach and push for the innovations needed to create more reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy systems.

Title: America Vs. The World? Both Can Win With These 8%+ Dividends

A detailed view of the earth from space with night lights It looks like 2024 will end with a big gain for investors in US stocks, with the S&P 500 up 28% year-to-date, even better than my (admittedly optimistic) expectations: I saw a roughly 15% gain for the S&P 500 going into the year. If this gain holds, 2024 will go down as one of the best years in the last 20, with only 2013 and 2019 doing (just slightly) better. However, unlike those years, the momentum isn’t coming mainly from tech, with the benchmark Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) actually trailing the market, with a 24.5% return year-to-date, as of this writing. That’s a good sign because it suggests that AI darlings like NVIDIA (NVDA) aren’t driving the market to irrational heights. Instead, this looks like a strong fundamental recovery after 2022’s selloff. Since that selloff was mainly driven by speculation about a recession that never happened, the 2024 bounce makes sense. Still, if you’re mainly holding US stocks, you might be wondering if, after all these gains, now is a good time to focus more on foreign shares. We actually discussed one strategy for doing so through our favorite closed-end funds (CEFs) in last Thursday’s article. The chart below lends weight to this idea. Look at how the benchmark S&P 500 index fund (in purple) has done compared to the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS), in orange. IXUS tracks global stocks, excluding the US: IXUS Total Returns Global stocks’ lag suggests it’s a good time to go into them. Problem is, this could be said for just about any given time since IXUS’s IPO over a decade ago. The fund (in orange below) has badly trailed the S&P 500 ever since. SPY Outperforms The reason behind this gap makes sense if you think about it: US companies are generally more profitable than their overseas cousins and, as a result, have attracted higher prices. This isn’t a 2024 story—it goes back nearly half a century, as this chart from Goldman Sachs shows. US Stocks Soar The takeaway here is that foreign stocks—at least if they’re bought individually or through an ETF—are at best a short-term investment. But the calculus changes somewhat when you buy them through a CEF, due to two things: When an international CEF trades at a deep enough discount, we can ride that discount as it closes, propelling the fund’s price along with it. And we’ll collect those high dividends as that happens. We can see that in the BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust (BGY), a holding in our CEF Insider service that we also discussed in last Thursday’s article. Since the start of 2024, BGY’s discount has shrunk from around 15% to 9% as I write this, helping drive a 13.5% total return. And with BGY yielding 9.1% now, thanks in part to a recently announced dividend hike, most of this return has come as dividend cash. So with discounted CEFs like BGY, then, buying international can make some sense, since you can get these funds’ assets at a discount and collect their outsized income streams while you wait for that discount to disappear. (Though we still have to be careful given global stocks’ long-term underperformance—with BGY’s discount narrowing, we are moving closer to shifting it to a “hold” form a “buy” in our portfolio. Then perhaps we’ll sell and take profits). That closing discount gives a fund like BGY a big advantage over an international ETF like the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA), which doesn’t get the “discount booster” a marked-down CEF does—and saddles us with a mere 2.9% dividend. We can see the difference these things make when we stack up the year-to-date total return of our CEF, BGY (in orange), with EFA (in purple). BGY Outperforms But our international-CEF exception aside, we continue to focus mainly on US-based stocks (and US-based CEFs) in CEF Insider. We can see why in the performance of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a holding in our portfolio that’s topped the S&P 500 with a 30.6% year-to-date return. The fund holds many US blue chips we all know well: Microsoft (MSFT), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Visa (V) among them. It trades at an 11.4% discount. The best part? Nearly half of the fund’s return came as dividends, thanks to ADX’s high yield: 8.1% as I write this. This is not easy for ADX’s management, investing as they are in a relatively volatile asset class, because they need to maintain a high cash outflow while still staying in the market. But ADX has a long history of sending high payouts to investors—and a long history in general: the fund was founded back in 1929. The bottom line? For income and for long-term performance, ADX is a clear winner. And second, any long-term investment outside the US should be handled with care and generally shorter term, with deep-discounted, and high-yielding, CEFs playing a role.

So with discounted CEFs like BGY, then, buying international can make some sense, since you can get these funds’ assets at a discount and collect their outsized income streams while you wait for that discount to disappear. (Though we still have to be careful given global stocks’ long-term underperformance—with BGY’s discount narrowing, we are moving closer to shifting it to a “hold” form a “buy” in our portfolio. Then perhaps we’ll sell and take profits). That closing discount gives a fund like BGY a big advantage over an international ETF like the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA), which doesn’t get the “discount booster” a marked-down CEF does—and saddles us with a mere 2.9% dividend. We can see the difference these things make when we stack up the year-to-date total return of our CEF, BGY (in orange), with EFA (in purple). BGY Outperforms But our international-CEF exception aside, we continue to focus mainly on US-based stocks (and US-based CEFs) in CEF Insider. We can see why in the performance of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a holding in our portfolio that’s topped the S&P 500 with a 30.6% year-to-date return. The fund holds many US blue chips we all know well: Microsoft (MSFT), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Visa (V) among them. It trades at an 11.4% discount. The best part? Nearly half of the fund’s return came as dividends, thanks to ADX’s high yield: 8.1% as I write this. This is not easy for ADX’s management, investing as they are in a relatively volatile asset class, because they need to maintain a high cash outflow while still staying in the market. But ADX has a long history of sending high payouts to investors—and a long history in general: the fund was founded back in 1929. The bottom line? For income and for long-term performance, ADX is a clear winner. And second, any long-term investment outside the US should be handled with care and generally shorter term, with deep-discounted, and high-yielding, CEFs playing a role.

LONG BEACH, Calif. - Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB), a rapidly growing space technology company with a market capitalization of nearly $13 billion and impressive 497% stock return over the past six months, has announced the delivery of its second Pioneer spacecraft to Vandenberg Space Force Base and the completion of a third spacecraft for Varda Space Industries, Inc. The company is fulfilling a contract for four vehicles intended to advance commercial manufacturing in space. According to InvestingPro data, Rocket Lab has demonstrated strong revenue growth of 54% over the last twelve months. The Pioneer spacecraft are designed, built, and tested at Rocket Lab's Spacecraft Production Complex in Long Beach, California. They are equipped to support Varda's reentry capsule, which conducts operations in microgravity that are challenging or infeasible on Earth. The spacecraft provide systems for power, communications, propulsion, and attitude control, and are crucial for maneuvering Varda's capsule for reentry to Earth. With a healthy current ratio of 2.58, InvestingPro analysis shows the company maintains strong operational flexibility with liquid assets exceeding short-term obligations. Rocket Lab's first Pioneer spacecraft for Varda was launched in 2023 and spent eight months in orbit, enabling the production of ritonavir crystals, a drug used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. The successful deorbit and landing of the capsule occurred in Utah in February 2024. The second mission, set for launch in the first quarter of 2025, will involve similar in-space operations and is planned to conclude with a landing at the Koonibba Test Range in South Australia. Rocket Lab's rapid production of the third spacecraft, shortly after the second, showcases its strategy of vertical integration and enhanced satellite production capabilities. This approach aims to optimize schedule and cost efficiency in satellite production. Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab founder and CEO, emphasized the company's role in setting new standards for rapid, reliable satellite production. Varda CEO and co-founder Will Bruey expressed that the mission represents a move toward frequent reentry operations, aiming to make them as routine as launches. This partnership between Rocket Lab and Varda is part of a broader trend in the commercial space industry, focusing on leveraging the unique conditions of space to benefit various industries on Earth. For investors seeking deeper insights into Rocket Lab's financial health and growth prospects, InvestingPro offers comprehensive analysis with 15+ additional ProTips and detailed metrics in its Pro Research Report, helping investors make informed decisions in the rapidly evolving space sector. The information in this article is based on a press release statement. In other recent news, Rocket Lab USA has successfully conducted a hypersonic technology test for the U.S. Department of Defense as part of the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonics Test Bed project. The company also received a $23.9 million award from the U.S. Department of Commerce to expand its semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. These recent developments have led to an increase in analyst activity. BTIG has maintained a neutral rating on the company's shares, while BofA Securities, Cantor Fitzgerald, and TD Cowen have all increased their price targets for Rocket Lab, reflecting confidence in the company's growth potential. Rocket Lab reported a 55% year-on-year revenue growth in Q3 2024, totaling $105 million, with Q4 revenue projected to be between $125 million and $135 million. The company's Neutron rocket, a key component of its growth strategy, has reached a new milestone, entering the qualification stage and securing its first commercial launch order. These are just a few of the recent developments that highlight Rocket Lab's ongoing momentum in the aerospace industry. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Title: Nvidia stock slumps into a correction — while Broadcom basks in its own 'Nvidia moment'

Nvidia (NVDA+4.07%) stock is in correction territory, and rival chipmaker Broadcom’s (AVGO-3.59%) late-year boost took a hit Tuesday morning. Shares of Nvidia fell 2.9% Tuesday, trading at $128.17, after slumping into a correction by market close the day before. A correction typically refers to when a stock falls 10% or more from an all-time high closing price. Nvidia stock rallied to an all-time high of $148.87 in early November. Competing semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom ended its hot streak after closing up more than 11% Monday and ending the day at $250. Broadcom stock fell more than 5% in Tuesday morning trading, to $326.54 per share. So far this month, shares of Broadcom are up roughly 50%, putting the stock on track to have its best month ever and adding hundreds of billions to its market capitalization. Broadcom now has a market cap of $1.17 trillion. Nvidia stock is still up more than 170% year-to-date. Broadcom shares have climbed 130% in the same period. As Nvidia sinks and Broadcom soars, the latter chipmaker is finally having its own “Nvidia moment,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note reported by MarketWatch (NWSA+1.15%). The company’s “robust AI story is finding its own ‘Nvidia moment’ with a likely sharp new product ramp into [the second half of] 2025, and outlook for material opportunity … a few years out,” Rasgon said. Despite a “fairly lousy” core business outside of artificial intelligence, Broadcom posted promising fourth-quarter earnings last week that beat Wall Street estimates and provided upbeat guidance for the year to come. This past fiscal year, Broadcom generated a record $30.1 billion in semiconductor revenue, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion, the company said. AI revenue alone grew 220% on an annual basis, fueled by the company’s AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. Broadcom is expecting first quarter revenue of approximately $14.6 billion, with EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of 66% of projected revenue over the three months. In a call with analysts, company leadership said it sees the opportunity “over the next three years in AI as massive.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Every year has its share of PR disasters, headline-grabbing hacks, and puzzling product launches. In 2024, we saw a chip giant struggle for relevance, an AI exec get in over his head, and a faulty software update brick millions of PCs. And let's not forget Elon's antics. Here are some of the top fails from the year and a few honorable mentions for notable 2024 facepalms. This will go down as Intel’s worst year in recent memory. The board booted out CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was once hailed as Intel’s savior. The chip maker was also forced to lay off 15,000 employees. And it’s struggled to respond to demand for AI GPUs, a market Nvidia has been dominating. On top of all this, Intel’s reputation for PC desktop chips took a serious hit after admitting that its “Raptor Lake” processors suffered from a voltage bug capable of damaging the silicon. Although Intel pledged to replace the affected processors, many PC builders flocked to rival AMD and its Ryzen 7 9800X3D gaming processor. Here’s hoping Team Blue makes a comeback in 2025; the industry could use more competition in PC chips and graphics cards.—Michael Kan It looks like China has the power to spy on your phone calls, texts, and possibly more. A Chinese-linked hacking group known as “Salt Typhoon” breached at least eight US telecommunications companies in a campaign that’s potentially been going on for two years, according to White House officials. What makes the hack especially disturbing is that Salt Typhoon hackers likely remain in US networks as federal investigators try to uncover the full scope of the scheme. The only good news is that Salt Typhoon is focused on high-profile politicians, including Donald Trump, rather than average Americans. But it could take months or even years for the US to sort out the extent of the hack, and to shore up the country’s telecom networks. —Michael Kan It was never a good idea to allow any company to buy and sell people’s personal data. Unfortunately, the woeful state of data privacy in the US was on full display in 2024 when a little-known background check company called National Public Data lost as many as 272 million Social Security numbers to a hacker. The stolen database, which also included full names, addresses, and dates of birth, was leaked on a hacking forum this summer, giving scammers a valuable trove of data to exploit for identity theft schemes and other kinds of fraud. The company behind National Public Data has since shut down and is facing investigations and class-action lawsuits from across the country. But the damage is done. Millions of Americans now have another reason to worry about their privacy.—Michael Kan In July, we learned just how reliant the world is on a handful of companies in the tech space when cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike released a faulty kernel-level update. It crashed 8.5 million Windows PCs, which displayed the “blue screen of death” and unleashed global chaos. Over 2,700 flights were cancelled, US border checkpoints had to temporarily ditch their digital systems, FedEx and UPS packages were delayed, Social Security offices and DMVs came to a standstill, and healthcare facilities switched to manual operations. It also delayed some transit systems, caused brief 9-1-1 outages, and took down some payment systems. Delta Air Lines and CrowdStrike shareholders have since sued CrowdStrike over the faulty update. And Microsoft is prepping a Windows “Quick Machine Recovery” mode that will let IT administrators remotely fix a Windows machine even if it's unable to boot.—Kate Irwin At its Build developer conference this spring, Microsoft unveiled an AI-powered “Recall” feature for Windows PCs that takes snapshots of your activity so you can easily return to it at a later date. But it prompted concern that Recall could be compromised to expose user data or record passwords and financial data. Microsoft clarified that Recall is stored locally, but it still delayed the launch, beefed up Recall’s settings options, and made the feature opt-in by default for business users. In late November, Microsoft finally launched the feature for Windows 11 Insiders only, to gather feedback and potentially make more tweaks. But failing to address those security concerns upfront was an embarrassing black eye for Redmond.—Kate Irwin The archival Internet Archive platform experienced a DDoS attack in October that may have exposed 31 million users and took down the site for days. And the site didn’t restore full functionality right away when it came back online. A hacker who claimed responsibility for the attack said he did it because the US supports Israel and the Internet Archive is a US site. The hacker also called the US government “horrendous and hypocritical” in a statement. Thankfully, the Internet Archive’s operator, Brewster Kahle, has said that “the data is safe,” but the fact that the DDoS attack took the entire platform offline was an ominous fail that did little to calm concerns about our ability to preserve internet history.—Kate Irwin For a brief moment amid this year’s AI hype, a few startups imagined a new way to use it, and quickly crashed and burned. Rabbit and Humane both developed hardware with an AI-powered voice assistant inside. The idea? Free us from staring at cell phone screens by offering a more intuitive, always-available way to interact with the tech. The devices immediately garnered negative reviews. We gave the Rabbit R1 a 2/5 rating, finding that it couldn’t compete with or replace the widely available smart assistants that are already in our pockets. The Humane AI Pin, meanwhile, was slow to respond in our hands on at MWC, and the company was reportedly looking for a buyer shortly after launch. Apple may have a better shot with its revamped version of Siri, coming in 2026.—Emily Forlini EV owners were blindsided when one of the most popular home charger companies suddenly pulled the plug on its US business in October. EU-based JuiceBox posted a message to its website that basically said: “Sorry, but the hardware installed in your garage will no longer be supported in a few weeks. It’ll still charge the vehicle, but forget about any mobile app monitoring or over-the-air updates. And that public JuiceBox charger in your local grocery store parking lot? That’s just not going to work at all.” After some serious backlash, JuiceBox parent company EnelX signed a deal to prolong software support, but the ordeal underscores how you never truly own a software-defined piece of hardware.—Emily Forlini We don’t typically write about celebrities, but then Sam Altman ticked off Scarlett Johansson. The OpenAI CEO marketed the company’s Voice Mode feature as a real-life version of the 2013 movie Her, in which Johansson plays the voice of an AI named Samantha. But after a May demo of the tech featured a voice that sounded a lot like Johansson, the actress claimed that she declined Altman’s request to train the model on her voice. OpenAI denied using Johansson’s voice; it said it hired a separate voice actor for the role of "Sky." Still, the company disabled that voice option, and Sky was not one of the voice options when Advanced Voice Mode rolled out this fall.—Emily Forlini Days after he announced plans to acquire Twitter in 2022, Elon Musk argued that the platform needed to be “politically neutral” in order for it to “deserve public trust.” This approach, he said, “effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally.” In March 2024, he also pledged to not donate to either US presidential candidate, but by July, he’d changed his tune dramatically, swapping neutrality for MAGA hats. “If we want to preserve freedom and a meritocracy in America, then Trump must win,” Musk tweeted in September. He seized the @America X handle to promote Trump, donated millions to his campaign, shared doctored and misleading clips of VP Kamala Harris, and is now working closely with the president-elect on an effort to cut government spending, which is most certainly a conflict of interest given his government contracts. The shift sent many X users to alternatives like Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon in the days after the US election.—Chloe Albanesius Check out our masthead to see who we are, and what we do.

Title: Blue Owl mulls merger of portfolio firms to form industry titan - Financial Times

Investing.com -- Billionaire dealmaker Michael Rees is exploring the possibility of merging three to five firms from Blue Owl's portfolio to create a major player in the industry, according to the Financial Times, citing four sources privy to the matter. The proposed combination would encompass a range of sectors, including private equity buyouts, credit-based investments, infrastructure deals, and real estate. Blue Owl was established in 2021 through the merger of Dyal Capital, a firm founded by Rees, with credit investor Owl Rock Capital (NYSE:OBDC) and a public Spac during the boom. It owns stakes in private infrastructure groups such as Stonepeak and I Squared Capital, as well as firms with large infrastructure-like portfolios like Bridgepoint. Blue Owl also holds minority stakes in Vista Equity Partners, Silver Lake, HIG Capital, Platinum Equity, Cerberus, and Clearlake Capital among others. The firm would not be involved in any potential merger. While Rees's proposal is still in its nascent stages, it highlights the ongoing consolidation in the alternative investment market. Top dealmakers in the industry are being compelled to decide whether to remain private and focus on a few core strengths or join larger publicly listed financial groups. Last week's $12 billion acquisition of credit manager HPS by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), a company in Blue Owl's portfolio, has prompted many firms to reconsider their strategies. There's a growing concern among executives that the industry's influence will increasingly be controlled by a few diversified entities capable of attracting new capital from sources ranging from large sovereign wealth funds to individual investors and potentially even retirement savers. In October, Goldman Sachs executive Michael Brandmeyer cautioned that many independent private equity groups were underestimating the influx of cash to larger players and the challenges arising from succession processes. He referred to these groups as "zombie firms," stating that they were unaware they were investing their last funds. Despite the ongoing disruption in the private equity industry, advisors have noted that deal discussions rarely result in transactions due to concerns about conflicting strategies and personalities. As one private capital executive close to Blue Owl puts it, the merger proposed by Rees would be a "merger of equals," with different valuations in different sectors and some overlap, making it a complex yet potentially beneficial move.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Semiconductor Equipment Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR) stands against other best semiconductor equipment stocks to buy now. Semiconductors are the modern-day equivalent of oil when it comes to the general well-being of the global economy. Tens of thousands of gadgets, computers, cars, and other items and products rely on a steady stream of chips to power up today’s world. As a result, chip manufacturers often have a steady flow of orders that they have to consistently churn out to ensure that a multitude of industries are not disrupted. However, while chip manufacturers often see most media coverage, the complex nature of transforming sand into a chip capable of 20 petaflops of output requires thousands of steps. To execute these steps, manufacturers rely on a diverse set of suppliers for a myriad of products such as chip manufacturing machines, specialty chemicals, masks, design technologies, and other items. Firms that provide these products and technologies are called semiconductor equipment providers and their role in the industry is just as important as the chip manufacturers’ is. To understand why semiconductor equipment stocks are important, consider the Biden Administration’s $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act. Signed by the President in 2022, it aims to ensure that the American semiconductor industry catches up to its peers in Taiwan and South Korea and is not dependent on any disruptions in the South China Sea. The biggest beneficiary of the CHIPS Act is the Taiwanese contract chip manufacturer that leads the world in manufacturing technologies. It ranked 4th on our recent list of trending AI stocks, and the firm has received $6.6 billion in direct funding and it is eligible for $5 billion in additional loans to set up advanced manufacturing facilities in Arizona. Yet, even though the first of these facilities is set to start production in the first half of 2025, the fact that the firm’s operations are based in Taiwan is already creating problems. For starters, a report from Reuters suggests that the world’s leading AI GPU manufacturer (which ranked 3rd on our list above) might have to ship its GPUs to Taiwan for packaging after they’ve been manufactured in the US. This is because after the chips are manufactured, they have to be packaged to ensure power supply and communications with the rest of the computer system. The packaging technologies for these advanced chips are called Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS), and for the Taiwanese firm, all of its packaging facilities are located in its home region. The need to ship the chips to Taiwan for packaging is not the only hurdle for the fab’s American manufacturing operations. Another problem, and one that is directly related to semiconductor equipment stocks, relates to the different chemicals that are required throughout the chip manufacturing process. These chemicals include sulfuric acid, acetone, ammonium hydroxide, and others to ensure the purity of the silicon wafer throughout the fabrication process. However, according to a report from Macquarie Bank, since the Taiwanese fab relies on Taiwan-based firms for its chemical supply chain, the costs of manufacturing chips at the Arizona site could be 30% higher than in Taiwan. The higher costs stem from the fact that the chemical companies are hesitant to move to the US since they might be unable to enjoy economies of scale and the resulting cost benefits. The bank outlines that the lack of an American chemical supply chain that is qualified by the Taiwanese fab means that chemicals such as sulfuric acid might be costlier to ship internationally than their list price. Therefore, it’s clear that semiconductor equipment firms play an equally important role in chip fabrication. Another important example of this fact is the Dutch chip manufacturing machinery provider that ranked 9th on a recent list of AI news and ratings that Wall Street was watching. This firm is the only company in the world capable of manufacturing high-end chip-making tools called EUV scanners. Without these tools, firms such as the Taiwanese fab cannot make leading-edge chips with feature sizes smaller than 7-nanometer. In fact, the rising threat of China utilizing Western technologies for military use has also led the US government to stop the chip manufacturing equipment provider from selling its equipment to China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). The sanctions have dealt a sharp blow to Chinese chip manufacturing ambitions, with the latest chip from Huawei still being manufactured on the older 7-nanometer node. In contrast, the latest iPhone uses chips built through the 3-nanometer process technology. To make our list of the best semiconductor equipment stocks to buy, we ranked all US-listed semiconductor equipment stocks by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024 and picked out those with the highest number of investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close up of a micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) package awaiting testing. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 27 Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR) is an Arizona-based semiconductor equipment provider that provides semiconductor testing, packaging, and other associated services. Its shares are down 17% year-to-date, which is unsurprising even though packaging technologies have gained importance in the chip industry because of AI chips. Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR) depends to a large extent on the health of the smartphone industry. For the nine months ending in September, 49% of the firm’s revenue came from smartphones and communications devices. The market for these devices depends on consumer spending, and Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR)’s shares dropped by a massive 18% in July after the firm’s midpoint third-quarter EPS guidance of $0.49 missed analyst estimates of $0.65. Naturally, the smartphone market has to recover for the firm to benefit from tailwinds. Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR) has also won funding from the US government under the CHIPS Act for packaging, and it is also a TSMC partner for the Arizona site. Both these factors can help the firm in today’s AI-driven chip era. Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR)’s management commented on its TSMC deal during the Q3 2024 earnings call. Here is what they said: “First of all, the MOU that we signed with TSMC, now is that it’s intended to offer our mutual customers a seamless manufacturing supply chain and a technology offering between Asia and the US and by standardizing on advanced packaging technology in the US versus Asia that offers these joint customers a seamless transition for dual qualification of specific devices. And that will happen in our Peoria factory, it will be for the Compute segment, but also for the Communications segment technologies. Now we have to remember that our Peoria factory, our Arizona factory is not captive to TSMCs, but we will run TSMC technology in that factory, specifically for joint customers. Overall, AMKR ranks 10th on our list of best semiconductor equipment stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMKR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMKR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

BlackRock’s IBIT dominates Bitcoin ETF market with $54 billion in assets. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States have now eclipsed gold ETFs in total assets, achieving this feat in less than a year of their launch. According to data from K33 Research, the combined assets of Bitcoin ETFs have reached $129.3 billion. Meanwhile, gold ETFs hold a slightly lower total of $128.9 billion. This shift highlights Bitcoin’s rapid rise in the ETF market, outpacing gold, which has enjoyed a two-decade advantage. Investor appetite for BTC ETFs has surged, especially following the success of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump in the US elections on Nov. 5. The sector’s growth has been further fueled by consistent inflows, marked by a 13-day streak during which these ETFs attracted over $2 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leads the market with over $54 billion in assets. This figure is nearly double its iShares Gold Trust (IAU) holdings, underlining BTC’s growing dominance in the sector. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also play significant roles, each managing approximately $22 billion in assets.

Title: Meta Quest 3S review: “Maybe the best entry-level VR device ever created”

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Meta Quest 3S isn’t like other Lite hardware, because it actually feels like the flagship Quest 3 and you really need to look to see the differences. This will give most players everything in a VR headset they’ll want, and it’s not going to break the bank like this technology usually does. In short, it continues the mission of the Meta Quest 2 by bringing great standalone gaming, mixed reality, and a huge wealth of games and apps to the masses at a reasonable price point. Approachable price tag Huge library of games A lot of spec similarities with the Quest 3 and… …It actually feels like an affordable Quest 3 Controller tracking isn’t great Battery life is fine Fresnel lenses do feel like a downgrade No audio jack Why you can trust GamesRadar+ Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. I’m going to level with you and admit that, even for someone like me who has tried a number of different VR headsets through the years, it can be hard to tell the difference between the Meta Quest 3S and its full-fat sibling. Yes, there are a few obvious comparisons you can make, but for their respective prices, the Quest 3S does a very impressive imitation. And that’s a good thing. A lot of the time an “S” device that comes in cheaper than a flagship model feels half-baked because the manufacturer really wants you to spend money on the more expensive version. The Quest 3 is one of the best VR headsets out there at the moment, but it didn’t exactly continue the Quest 2’s mission of making virtual reality technology affordable for all. The Meta Quest 3S remedies that because it comes in two sizes (128GB and 256GB) and costs only $299.99 / £289.99 or $399.99 / £379. That lower MSRP is the same price as the Quest 2 before it was discontinued. Pandemic launch or not, that headset made a name for itself by making a mainstream VR device approachable, and the Quest 3S may see major success for the same reason. Not only does the Meta Quest 3S feel like the proper spiritual successor to the Quest 2, but it sort of looks like one too. It has the same rectangular look with sharper corners that make it look a bit more refined. If it weren’t for an upgraded frontal camera module, the Quest 3S would look eerily similar to the Meta Quest 2. For a “Lite” model of the Meta Quest 3, it does make me laugh that Zuck’s engineers have only managed to shave one measly gram off the Quest 3’s weight. It’s the equivalent of taking a feather out of your inventory in Skyrim and suddenly not being over-encumbered, and it’s hilarious that Meta is actually marketing it for its “lightweight design”. Nice try. The Quest 3S comes with the same cleverly designed head strap as the Quest 3. It’s definitely a basic, stock option, but it does the job with a top velcro strap that can be adjusted to your head size, as well as some loops around the back to tighten or loosen the fit. Thankfully, the design of the Quest 3S has been thoughtfully executed, since the best Meta Quest accessories made for the original will fit either headset - no need to buy specially fitted ones for either device. Out of the box, the facial interfaces of both feel identical, with some fabric upholstery and quite plush cushioning for your cheeks and forehead. It’s no surprise that the Quest 3S connects to a charger or gaming PC through USB-C, although it misses out on the Quest 3’s 3.5mm audio jack, which is a shame. I’m not sure this would cost too much more to add in 2024, and since budget buyers are far more likely to use it than wireless or Bluetooth headsets, it feels like a glaring omission. Thankfully, you get the additional onboard buttons for when your controllers inevitably run out of battery. Some volume adjustment keys and a handy action button lie on the headset’s underside, which should always be present on standalone headsets like this. There’s also the standard power button on the 3S’s left-hand side. Even when you’re looking at the spec sheets comparing the Quest 3 and 3S, you need a trained eye to figure out the differences, because, in truth, there aren’t many. Both feature the same Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor, which is one of the biggest wins of this more affordable headset. It’d be all too easy for Meta to scale back on power for the lighter model, but with so much competition in the VR world at the moment, the use of this processor feels like they’re rolling up their sleeves. The Pico 4 Ultra also launched this year, touting that same APU but even more RAM than the Quest 3. Despite Meta’s financial footwork to get around it when the Quest 3S launched, the Pico 4 Ultra is still a serious rival in Europe, so this processor is more important than a lot of shoppers realize. If you think about it, the Quest 3S gets you the processing power of the Quest 3, the Pico 4 Ultra, and even the new HTC Vive Focus Vision for undeniably cheaper than any of those devices. The latter will set you back $999 / £999, and although it’s designed to harness the power of the best graphics cards, that’s still a massive win for people buying the Quest 3S. The biggest talking point for most is that the Quest 3’s pancake lenses are missing from the Quest 3S. For me, this is perhaps the most noticeable change when using either headset. The wider area of focus really does make a difference in gaming and mixed-reality menu hopping. Combine that with a lower per-eye resolution, and the Quest 3S does start to feel more like a budget option. Still, with the same 8GB of RAM, integrated spatial audio speakers, and variable refresh rate, the Quest 3S has more than enough to make first-time VR buyers swoon. Another spec disparity of note is that the Quest 3 has an integrated depth sensor which can help with passthrough clarity as well as room tracking and mapping. The Quest 3S omits this, instead using a few InfaRed projectors to map out a room and your position in it. I didn’t notice less accurate tracking in my side-by-side tests of the 3 and 3S, but it might be worth taking into consideration if you play in a more sensitive area of your home with lots of breakable goodies near you. Similarly, if you play in darker rooms, the Quest 3’s depth sensor might be better for low-lighting conditions. Battery life is technically better on the Quest 3S, despite its mAh being smaller. Depending on what you use either headset for in one session, you’ll get a similar 2-hour battery life without a pro headstrap. I’ve found just over 2 hours for either is an accurate statement, with gaming being the more intensive activity that brings it down closer to that baseline. Neither is particularly impressive in terms of lifespan because they’re just short enough to feel like an inconvenience. If you don’t charge up between uses, you’re probably going to be cutting your next Power Wash Sim session short. What is constantly disappointing is that the controllers have an even worse battery life, and will often run out of charge between uses. For that reason, I can highly recommend charging docks to keep the controllers ready to go for your next session - unless you have an unlimited budget for AA batteries. I want to state right now that the Quest 3S is a very impressive VR gaming device for the money. Most of the performance notes I have are about the few times I paid attention to the man behind the curtain, noticing where the Quest 3 does things better. That’s probably going to be the case for most “Lite” model reviews because it’s where the natural comparisons are going to sit. That said, it doesn’t mean the Quest 3S isn’t worth buying. I’m really looking for the nitty gritty details I’ll mention below, and I’ll admit that they were quite tricky to find. Normally, I wouldn’t actually compare two devices so closely when they have a two-hundred-dollar price disparity, but the fact I feel those comparisons are valid says a lot of good things about the Quest 3S on its own. Even five years ago, the idea of an “entry-level” VR headset was pretty alien. The idea of a headset under $450 with full-color passthrough, genuine standalone gaming power, and loads of mixed-reality potential was so out of reach that it was a fantasy. For the first few weeks of testing this headset, I wasn’t actually sure what I was going to say in this review. Unless I really looked for the slight differences between the 3 and 3S, I couldn’t find them. I could boot up a game and play for hours without any immersion-breaking performance hiccups to give away that I was using a “budget” device. Especially if you’re not used to playing VR games, this headset will be very capable of making your jaw drop. Like the Quest 2 before it, it can immerse you to a degree that you’ll come out of a longer session and need to take a second look at your real hands to know you’re out of the Matrix. The resolution per eye may be weaker than the Quest 3 512GB, but when it’s that close to your eyeballs you don’t need to suspend your disbelief like you might need to on a big TV these days. In truth, it took me diving into the same levels in both headsets to really understand the weak points of the 3S. The Quest 3’s colors and display seem more vivid and colorful overall. Maybe this was the pancake lenses showing their worth, or the fact that two LCD displays are better than one. Perhaps it was a combination of these things and the Quest 3’s boosted resolution. Regardless, things just seem more focused, and colors appear clearer on Quest 3. The Quest 3S still does a great job though, making it easy to spot the tiny bits of grime that still needed washing away in Power Wash Sim. I must say, both headsets come up a bit short in Blade & Sorcery Nomad when it comes to jaggy lines - something the Pico 4 Ultra has them both beat on. Doing more formalized tests really solidifies the value of extra RAM in that headset, especially because environments and details in surroundings pop in much more noticeably on the Quest 3S. Controller tracking is also a bit disappointing, which makes some weapons in the game unusable. The Pico 4 Ultra suffered similar issues, but I felt much more immersed in my sequences of fantasy mass murder on Pico’s headset than I do on the Quest 3S. The increased resolution of the Quest 3 really shows its worth in Asgard’s Wrath 2, with even its softer, more illustrative art style appearing clearer on the flagship model. To a layman, these environments will still be plenty expressive on the 3S, but you definitely notice a difference with some beefed-up resolution and an extra display panel. The same great audio quality from the Quest 3 carries over to the 3S though, so I can’t make any complaints about how immersive and high-quality games sound. I’m not one for mixed-reality spatial computing, but I did a bit more testing with this headset than I usually do. I can see it being a big draw for people who like the look of the Apple Vision Pro but are attracted to a much more affordable device. Hand tracking works fairly well for the most part, allowing me to pinch my fingers to interact, or get physically closer to a virtual menu and use them like I would a touch screen. The fact that Meta's Quest OS windows now operate within real spaces is pretty clever. Going upstairs in a friend’s house, then looking down at the ground, only to see the headset’s app library window still open through the floor was a bit wild, and something people are bound to get a kick out of. Watching content on YouTube and streaming services was where I found the Quest 3 to be a much more versatile option because focus is such a priority for big virtual cinema-like screens. With Pancake lenses, you definitely get a wider area of a virtual cinema screen in clarity without needing to move your head. Similarly, the Quest 3S’s narrower FOV makes itself known in these instances where you aren’t fully immersed since it can be harder to zone out the black borders around your content. Either way, PSVR 2 and the detail and vivid colors its OLED displays can throw at your eyeballs is much better. Not least because the inky black surroundings of any virtual screen in cinematic mode help you to feel more immersed. Keep in mind that I’m making these comparisons from the point of someone who has tried lots of VR headsets and that I’ve really been looking for holes to pick in the 3S. Even five years ago, the idea of an “entry-level” VR headset was pretty alien. The idea of a headset under $450 with full-color passthrough, genuine standalone gaming power, and loads of mixed-reality potential was so out of reach that it was a fantasy. The Quest 3S has all of that, and the fact I can nitpick those features in a device at this price point is excellent. If you haven’t yet owned a modern, standalone VR headset, this is a fantastic option that gets you so many of the Quest 3’s software tricks and lots of its internals for a decent price. Enthusiasts who have played a lot of VR games before, on either a Quest 2 or PC VR headset, will probably want more than the 3S can provide, so I’d be inclined to recommend the full-fat Quest 3, or the Pico 4 Ultra. If you do have more budget to play with, maybe consider a PC option like the HTV Vive Focus Vision - not least because my concerns with how Meta collects our data still make me hesitant to recommend its hardware (see my Meta Quest Pro review). Still, this is maybe the best entry-level VR device ever created. Both in looks and spirit, it’s the spitting image of its father, the Meta Quest 2. However, with updated internals and software perks to its name, it’s potentially more worth a buy than its parent ever was. I tested the Meta Quest 3S for just over a month before writing this review. In that time I’ve used it for plenty of VR gaming, as well as watching some streaming content and general spatial computing tasks. I played a lot of Blade & Sorcery Nomad, Power Wash Sim VR, and Asgard’s Wrath 2 on the Quest 3S to test its gaming potential. To compare it with the Quest 3, I loaded up the same levels in each game and played them one after the other to take notes.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in?

Title: Analysis-2024 the 'year of the bond' as record inflows top $600 billion

By Harry Robertson LONDON (Reuters) -Investors have poured a record $600 billion into global bond funds this year, taking advantage of some of the highest yields in decades ahead of an uncertain 2025. Dwindling inflation has finally allowed central banks to lower interest rates, pushing investors to lock in the relatively high yields available and finally delivering the "year of the bond" after $250 billion left fixed-income funds in 2022. "The story is income," said Vasiliki Pachatouridi, head of EMEA iShares fixed income strategy at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK). "We are seeing the income being put back into fixed income. We haven't seen these levels of yields in almost 20 years." Bond yields tend to fall, and prices rise, as central banks reduce short-term borrowing costs. Although returns on the ICE BofA global bond index have been middling at around 2% this year, the yield on offer topped 4.5% late last year, the most since 2008. As of mid-December, $617 billion had flowed into developed and emerging market bond funds, according to financial data provider EPFR, topping 2021's $500 billion and putting 2024 on track to be a record year. Stocks, meanwhile, have drawn $670 billion of inflows as indexes in the U.S. and Europe scale new heights. Cash equivalent money market funds, which boast high yields and little risk, have fared the best, pulling in more than $1 trillion. CREDIT CRAZE Corporate bonds, which offer higher yields than equivalent government debt, have proven particularly popular, rallying as companies weathered the rise in central bank interest rates. The yield on the ICE BofA global corporate bond index has fallen to its lowest over risk-free government debt since before the financial crisis in 2007. "Before interest rates started to drift up a few years ago, a lot of companies locked in their funding for a long time," said Willem Sels, global chief investment officer at HSBC's private bank. "Therefore, the impact of rising borrowing costs on corporates was much less than people expected. At the same time, a lot of companies earned more on their cash holdings." PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE Investors have shown a clear preference for passive exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were on track for a record year with $350 billion of inflows by the end of November, according to Morningstar Direct data. "ETFs give investors access to a number of assets that previously were harder to trade, including bonds," said Martin Oehmke, professor of finance at the London School of Economics. "Corporate bonds, for example, are notoriously illiquid and ETFs offer easy access to this market in a much more liquid form." The two biggest passive fund players - BlackRock and Vanguard - have reaped the benefits. BlackRock's iShares fixed income ETF business alone attracted $111 billion of inflows between January and the end of October, according to estimates from Morningstar Direct. Vanguard's bond funds took in an estimated $120 billion, the vast majority of which went to its index business which includes ETFs. PIMCO, traditionally known for its active management, has also had a strong year. It has drawn around $46 billion into its bond funds, according to Morningstar, after shedding some $80 billion in 2022. FLOWS COULD SLOW A number of factors could cause inflows to slow in 2025. President-elect Donald Trump's tax-cutting and deregulatory agenda has caused U.S. stocks to jump and inflows into equities to surge, limiting the appeal of bonds. Data from EPFR and TD Securities shows $117 billion flowed into U.S. stock funds in the four weeks after Trump's Nov. 5 victory, more than four times the $27 billion into global bonds. Meanwhile, investors are sceptical that corporate bonds can rally much further after this year's strong performance. "It seems very hard to continue to expect spreads to tighten much more, and I don't believe that bond yields will be much lower from where we are today," said Carl Hammer, global head of asset allocation at Swedish bank SEB.

Title: GM investors plug into electrified growth story amid uncertain road

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. At every turn of the road, GM chair and CEO Mary Barra has reinforced the mantra that 2024 was the "year of execution." Barra and her team made good on that promise to investors who were yearning for better returns, ultimately earning the auto icon the 2024 Yahoo Finance Surprise of the Year award. "There's been a lot of change. We're an industry in transformation and GM itself is in the midst of making sure we're ready and proactive for the changes that are coming," Barra told Yahoo Finance in an exclusive sitdown. Tightening the grips on EV losses and making better-received cars have paid off for GM. Read More: Why Walmart won Yahoo Finance's Company of the Year award The company lifted its profit guidance each time it reported earnings in 2024, powered by strong adoption of new crossover models, such as the Chevy Trax and the Cadillac Lyriq EV, and savvy cost cuts. GM used its improving cash position to repurchase $2.4 billion in stock year to date, more than double the pace compared to one year ago. It's sent a clear signal that despite expensive investments in EVs and a costlier UAW deal inked in 2023, Barra and her team think the stock is an attractive long-term buy. Shares of GM charged to a 47% advance this year, outperforming the 14% drop for rival Ford (F), which has struggled on product quality, and above the S&P 500's 26% gain. "I really felt validation for the team on how well received each of our EVs were," Barra, sporting her trademark black leather jacket, said when asked what has surprised her about the year. The auto leader is now entering her 12th year at the helm — a tenure almost unheard of in competitive and returns-minded corporate America. What's next for Barra and GM in 2025 could mirror 2024, with a few twists and turns. Following in her father's footsteps (he was a die maker at GM's now-defunct Pontiac badge), Barra, 62, began her journey inspecting fenders at a Pontiac plant at age 18. She went on to graduate from the General Motors Institute in 1985, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering. From there, her career path was as curvy as a country road — with stints in communications, marketing, and manufacturing. It's these connections to the company that have given Barra a lot of credibility among the rank and file and shareholders. Now, her intricate knowledge and quicker speed to make tough calls have come together. "GM has walked the walk and talked the talk this year," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said. "This could be a triple-digit stock if they execute." Ives rates GM's stock at outperform. GM's third quarter earnings topped Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue reached $48.76 billion, beating estimates of $44.69 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.96, surpassing the $2.43 that was expected. The automaker also raised its full-year outlook for the third time. By comparison, in late October, Ford said it expected to hit the lower end of its full-year profit guidance. Ford guided to about $10 billion in earnings before interest and taxes this year, down from its prior range of $10 billion to $12 billion. Some strength for GM comes courtesy of its crossover vehicles and a more keen eye toward EV profits, Bank of America analyst John Murphy said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. He's bullish on GM's longer-term product portfolio, a mix of gas-powered trucks, cars, and EVs. “Importantly, when we get to calendar years ‘27 and ‘28, they have their pickups and large SUVs, which are an unbelievable franchise,” said Murphy, adding that no competitor has achieved this feat. “We may actually hit 18 million units in ‘27 and ‘28. I think there’s a tremendous amount of upside in the cycle." Barra had sought to be all-electric by 2035 but has since softened the stance amid industrywide weakness in EV sales. In July, GM delayed plans for a new Buick electric vehicle. Earlier this month, GM reached an agreement to sell its stake in a nearly completed EV battery plant in Lansing, Mich., to joint venture partner LG Energy Solution. GM expects to recoup its $1 billion investment in the plant. "We still have a plan that allows us to get there, and so we're still executing to that plan," Barra said of the 2035 EV target. "But the most important thing is, and I've been saying this for a couple years now, is we're going to be guided by the consumer. We want to give the consumer choice. What do they want to drive?" Investors don't want good money thrown after bad, either. But it's the uncertain return on EVs that continues to hold the stock's valuation back, analysts tell Yahoo Finance. Despite the year of big-time cost-cutting, stock buybacks, and upside earnings surprises, GM's stock only trades on a 4.9 times forward price-to-earnings multiple, according to Yahoo Finance data. For perspective, the S&P 500 trades at 23 times forward earnings. Tesla clocks in at 126 times forward earnings. Even Ford trades at 5.9 times forward earnings. "Without a doubt as far as the earnings and EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization] and free cash flow, we’re going to be at record levels for GM this year," said Murphy. "That’s the level that nobody thought would ever be consistently hit and it seems like they may be hitting that for the next few years.” To stay in the good graces of investors, GM has made a flurry of key decisions late in the year that could shore up profits further. Besides unloading the aforementioned Lansing EV plant, GM opted this month to restructure its China operations. The restructuring will lead to a $5 billion non-cash charge in the fourth quarter. For years, GM has owned 50% of its joint venture with SAIC General Motors Corp. "It was absolutely the right decision to make. And I think there is the chance over time that the rationalization of restructuring of China ultimately means an exit," Murphy said. Then, after a series of operational setbacks, GM pulled the plug on its Cruise robotaxi business. The company had invested $10 billion since acquiring Cruise in 2016. GM said it would merge its Cruise robotaxi business with its in-house, consumer-facing autonomous and driving assist technology group in charge of its Supercruise software. "I think we made some difficult decisions this year to set the business up for success because we're trying to really be proactive and look at where's the business going," Barra said of the China and Cruise decisions. More difficult decisions may be in the cards for 2025, if incoming President Donald Trump slaps 25% tariffs on key auto supplier countries Mexico and Canada. The auto industry is responsible for 26% of imports from Mexico to the US and 12% from Canada, UBS researchers estimate. GM produces highly profitable pickup trucks in Mexico. It has five large assembly plants in the countries. "Almost a third of GM's vehicles are coming from outside the US or from mostly from Mexico in North America," Murphy explained. "And there's a question of how fast you can react to that. You don't have a lot of extra capacity in the US to move." Barra is clear-eyed about the situation. "[Tariffs are] going to have an impact depending on what it is, how long it is, it will impact prices, which, you know, I think could have an impact on demand. But I think we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. I think right now is the time to communicate and make sure people understand the different impacts that will happen based on different decisions," Barra said. "And I have confidence that the new administration will look and do what's best for the American consumer and best for continuing to have great jobs that the auto industry provides."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Weight Loss Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) stands against the other weight loss stocks. Most people have at some point sought to include weight loss and physical exercise in their daily life. The weight loss and fitness market is quite substantial worldwide since improving one's fitness can have direct physical and psychological benefits. Over one billion people worldwide—650 million adults, 340 million adolescents, and 39 million children—are obese, according to the WHO. A novel class of weight-loss medications that don't include strict exercise regimens or diets seems to be revolutionary. People who are overweight or obese can lose 15% to 20% of their body weight with the aid of these ground-breaking medications. According to Andy Acker, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, "This may be the largest opportunity we've ever seen in the pharmaceutical industry." Weight-loss medications are undoubtedly well-liked. Investors are drawing comparisons between the leader in artificial intelligence chips and the US pioneer in weight-loss drugs. Given this increase in demand, Morgan Stanley Research has raised its forecast for the worldwide obesity medication market from $77 billion to $105 billion by 2030. Branded obesity medications brought approximately $6 billion in 2023. According to Forbes, the most prescribed Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 GLP-1 agonist in 2023 was Semaglutide, the market leader for obesity medications and the generic form of Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus. It accounted for almost 88% of all new prescriptions. At present, the FDA has approved just three GLP-1 medications for weight control: tirzepatide, liraglutide, and semaglutide. By 2030, the GLP-1 market is expected to grow to $100 billion, driven equally by obesity and diabetes, according to JP Morgan Research. Thirty million GLP-1 users, or around 9% of the population, may be in the US by 2030. The rising demand for obesity drugs will have a broad effect, helping industries like biotech but creating challenges for others like the food and beverage industry. According to Chris Schott, a Senior Analyst specializing in the U.S. Diversified Biopharma industry, “GLP-1s have been used to treat T2D since 2005, starting with the approval of Byetta, with follow-on products continually improving on efficacy. The most recent, Ozempic and Mounjaro, offer significant advantages over previous products and have accelerated class growth,” “Indeed, the newest generations of GLP-1s and combos lead to 15-25+% weight loss on average, well above prior generations of products.” Some are praising the most recent generation of GLP-1 pharmaceuticals as "miracle drugs" for the treatment of obesity. However, because GLP-1s are expensive and have limited insurance coverage, not all obese people can use them. According to Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics and the chairman of MIT's economics department, the annual cost of treating 40% of obese Americans at the current rate—roughly $15,000 per person—would surpass $1 trillion. That's almost the same as the government spends on the entire Medicare program. That's a staggering figure. According to a study released in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the use of GLP-1 medications, including semaglutide, for weight loss has increased over the last ten years, while it has dropped by about 10% among those with type 2 diabetes. The researchers warn that the ensuing extended drug scarcity may limit the treatments' availability to diabetics. Dr. Yee Hui Yeo, a clinical fellow in Cedars-Sina's Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, emphasized that it is crucial to ensure that diabetic patients have access to GLP-1 therapies as the demand for obesity medications increases. According to the FDA, growing demand is the cause of the shortages. The European Medicines Agency warned that the GLP-1 medicine shortage is a "major public health concern" that is unlikely to be resolved in 2024, indicating that the shortages affect more than only the US. According to NPR, shortages have made it difficult for those with diabetes to get their prescriptions, and some have had to reduce the medications they can use. The potential of GLP-1 medications, which were first created to treat diabetes but are currently being used to treat obesity, was covered by the panelists on "Weighing the Future of Obesity Drugs," which included Julia Angeles of Baillie Gifford, Debra Netschert of Jennison Investments, and Gentry Lee of Fayez Serofim. Netschert highlighted ongoing efforts to further reduce injection frequency and minimize adverse responses, as well as the development of GLP-1 medicine delivery from weekly dosages to multiple daily injections. Despite their exceptional efficacy, Netschert noted that due to supply limits, 1.5 million of the 110 million eligible patients in the US are now receiving therapy with GLP-1 medications. In their disagreement over who should foot the bill, Netschert pointed to significant insurance and Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements, while Angeles asserted that most patients pay cash. According to Netschert, up to 700 million people globally might require these medications outside of American borders. Notably, the panel found that GLP-1 medications were approved more quickly in the United Kingdom than in any other country, indicating their perceived value. The UK payors are generally stringent. Since the market for obesity medications is still in its infancy, it would be a good idea to add several weight reduction stocks to your watchlists. For this list, we scanned through holdings of weight loss ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 weight loss stocks. From that list, we picked 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, based on data tracked by the Insider Monkey database. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is a British-Swedish multinational biopharmaceutical company specializing in developing and manufacturing treatments for diseases such as cancer, respiratory conditions, cardiovascular issues, and autoimmune disorders. Its product portfolio includes biologics, vaccines, and prescription drugs like Tagrisso for lung cancer, Farxiga for diabetes and heart failure, and Symbicort for asthma and COPD. The company is among the largest pharmaceutical companies worldwide. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is advancing in the weight loss and obesity treatment market with innovative drug candidates. AZD5004, an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist licensed from Eccogene, offers a convenient alternative to injectables. Phase I trials demonstrated safety at lower doses, with patients experiencing 5.8% weight loss and improved glucose levels. Now entering Phase IIb trials, AZD5004 is expected to generate $800 million in sales by 2032 due to its favorable tolerability and simplified manufacturing. These developments make AZN one of the best weight loss stocks on our list. AZD6234, a long-acting amylin receptor agonist, targets gastric emptying and appetite suppression, catering to patients intolerant to GLP-1 therapies. Phase I results showed weight loss with manageable side effects. The corporation is exploring its use in combination with AZD9550, a GLP-1/glucagon dual agonist, to enable once-weekly dosing and fat-selective weight loss, enhancing patient convenience and treatment efficacy. By developing oral treatments and combination therapies, AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) aims to broaden its market presence and meet diverse patient needs in obesity care. As of Q3 2024, 42 hedge funds held shares in the company as tracked by the Insider Monkey database. The largest shareholder in the company was Fisher Asset Management with holdings worth $816.5 million. Analysts hold a consensus Strong Buy rating on the stock. Overall AZN ranks 9th on our list of the best weight loss stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:VKTX) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders. Its key products include VK2809 which is a thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist for lipid and metabolic disorders like NASH and NAFLD, and VK2735 which is a dual agonist for obesity and metabolic disorders. The company is also developing VK0214, a thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) targets patients with obesity, liver diseases, and rare genetic conditions, planning to distribute its products through pharmaceutical channels once approved. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported a net loss of $24.9 million, or $0.22 per share, an increase from the same period in 2023. This rise in losses was mainly due to higher research and development (R&D) and general and administrative (G&A) expenses. For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, the net loss totaled $74.5 million, or $0.69 per share, driven by similar factors. R&D expenses increased to $22.8 million in Q3 2024 from $18.4 million in Q3 2023, due to higher costs in drug manufacturing, salaries, benefits, and regulatory services. G&A expenses rose to $13.8 million from $8.9 million, largely driven by stock-based compensation, legal and patent services, and third-party consultancy. Despite these higher expenses, Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) significantly improved its financial position, with cash holdings of $930 million as of September 2024, up from $362 million at the end of 2023. This boost in cash reserves will support ongoing and future clinical trials. As of Q3 2024, 41 hedge funds held shares in the company, as tracked by the Insider Monkey database. The largest shareholder in the company was Artia Global Partners with shares worth $33.7 million. Viking Therapeutics, Inc.

Title: Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia moment’ has arrived. Now it needs to deliver

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc.’s massive rally after last week’s earnings report is reminiscent of when Nvidia Corp. shares first started to take off back in 2023. The chipmaker now needs to prove it can follow through to become another giant of the artificial intelligence era. Most Read from Bloomberg How California Sees the World, and Itself Hong Kong's Expat Party Hub Reshaped by Chinese Influx London’s Tube Fares Are Set to Rise by 4.6% Next Year Broadcom shares have soared 38% through Monday’s close — the two trading days since it reported results — pushing the company’s market capitalization to nearly $1.2 trillion. At the heart of the rally is Broadcom’s prediction that the addressable market for AI components it designs for data center operators will be as big as $90 billion by fiscal 2027. But there’s a lot to be done to turn that opportunity into reality. Shares fell as much as 4.7% in early trading Tuesday. “This is kind of like the Nvidia moment of maybe a year-and-a-half ago where they blew the number out and everybody had to catch up and chase it,” said Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer at Mahoney Asset Management, which owns the stock. Broadcom is showing investors that the demands from AI computing are so big that there’s plenty of room for other winners aside from Nvidia, Mahoney said. Broadcom was having a strong year even before last week’s results, with solid growth in its AI business underpinning its performance as one of the top stocks in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Still, it hasn’t been a completely smooth ride: The shares plunged in September after the company gave a disappointing forecast because of weakness in its non-AI operations. This quarter’s results have turned the focus squarely back to AI. Broadcom shares are now up more than 110% year-to-date, set for the best annual performance since their 2009 listing. Analysts have been scrambling to keep up, with multiple Wall Street firms hiking price targets and estimates following the earnings. Still, even a 19% jump in the average analyst target since the results has failed to keep pace with the shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This trajectory has inevitably spurred comparisons with Nvidia, the stock market’s original AI winner. Nvidia followed its blowout earnings report in May 2023 with a series of estimate-beating results and quarterly forecasts. It has also defied skeptics who said 2024 would be tough for the shares. Nvidia is up about 159% this year, but has pulled back in the past few days — possibly because investors are considering the prospect of rising competition from Broadcom. “I see a lot of parallels between Broadcom and Nvidia,” said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, who sees reason to believe Broadcom’s stock can show sustainable gains in the same way as Nvidia. “Obviously Broadcom still needs to deliver to justify a 38 times multiple, but it has shown good growth and execution this year.” That multiple — the price investors have to pay for shares relative to earnings projected over the next 12 months — is pushing deeper into record territory. That may suggest Broadcom has limited room for error, though Nvidia has set a bullish precedent for investors wanting to jump onto the next big potential AI winner. Nvidia’s profits grew so fast last year that the valuation actually got cheaper as the stock rose, because estimates were being raised at an even faster clip. Estimates for Broadcom’s net earnings per share for fiscal 2025 have risen 12% in the past week. Still, not every “Nvidia moment” has turned into a sustained gain, with some companies failing to live up to expectations or seeing share-price rallies stall. Arm Holdings Plc gave a bullish forecast in February, and said it was “only at the beginning” of the AI boom. That sparked a 93% surge in the stock over the next three sessions, but the shares haven’t progressed much since then and are now down more than 20% from a July peak. “It is too soon to say whether we’re going to see a series of blowout reports like we’ve gotten from Nvidia,” said Alec Young, chief investment strategist at Mapsignals. “Broadcom has done a really good job, but these things don’t always end well.” Top Tech Stories TikTok and its Chinese parent company asked the US Supreme Court to block a government ban set to take effect next month, invoking favorable comments about the popular social-media platform from President-elect Donald Trump. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has agreed to sell its Intime department store business to Youngor Fashion Co. for around $1 billion in a move to offload non-core assets. Kioxia Holdings Corp. was supposed to be an irresistible debutant in a hot Japanese market, heralding the rise of a homegrown chipmaker with big backers and a storied pedigree. It may get a cooler reception than anticipated. Beijing-based Zhipu raised a further 3 billion yuan ($412 million) to power its artificial intelligence development efforts.

Title: Ethereum’s (ETH) Comeback Could Push Its Price to $5000 By the End of 2024, Rival also Positioned for a 31x ROI in 6 Weeks

Most Widely Read Newspaper Kindly share this story: Analysts are now predicting that Ethereum could rise back into the cryptocurrency market’s limelight and surpass its previous all time high of $4,850 in 2024. There are a number of factors driving this optimistic view including substantial market activity and increased institutional entreaty. With this, the accompanying RXS token, which targets real world assets (RWA) is also taking shape, setting the scene for impressive returns during the presale. Ethereum’s Meteoric Rise: Will ETH Hit $5,000 and Beyond in 2025? In the last few months, Ethereum (ETH) has been on an incredible rebound, taking off from a low of about $2,500 in October, to near $4,000 by the time we enter December. A number of key developments in the Ethereum ecosystem have been blamed for this surge. Also notable, the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) projects set new all time highs, suggesting there’s a lot of activity and confidence amongst users. In addition, spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) injection also pulled in huge inflows to invigorate Ethereum’s market position. If Ethereum can hold ground and surge past these key resistance levels, analysts say it’s not unrealistic to see the digital asset reach $5,000 within the next few months. On the technical indicators side, ETH is still bullish as the digital asset remains above key moving averages that indicate that buying interest is likely to persist. Also, different experts in the market have the positive sentiment that Ethereum could be soaring to newer all time highs as far as early 2025. https://x.com/rovercrc/status/1865691790369554473 RXS and Ethereum: The Dynamic Duo Transforming Crypto Investment in 2025 Of course, Ethereum is taking the most attention, but the new token RXS, features its own innovative solution to integrating real world assets into the blockchain space. Runs on the Ethereum network and seeks to fill the gap between classic finance and the decentralized finance space by tokenizing real life physical assets. Therefore, RXS can be considered as a potentially lucrative investment opportunity due to its unique value proposition. RXS is currently in presale and has already made impressive traction. In the next stage, the token price is $0.125, yet before Stage 9 of its presale finishes, it will soar to $0.150. This asset backed token has raised over $25 million on the presale, demonstrating strong investor confidence and demand for this asset backed token. Analyst believe RXS stands for a significant price appreciation in the short term, estimating the ROI up to 31 times in six weeks. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1857692542290059502 Cryptocurrency market overall is on an uprise, lead from the investor’s interest and developments in the crypto regulatory space. Since institutional players are still entering the market, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or projects like RXS will have the opportunity to gain from this injection of capital. However, major institutional investor purchases on Ethereum, such as from BlackRock, have propped up Ethereum’s recent price movements. Those endorsements not only furtherWebView the long term potential of Ethereum, but also drive retail investors to enter the space. Additionally, the demand for ETH is likely to rise, too, as more people participate with Ethereum’s ecosystem through decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs. The fact this adoption is growing, however, will be critical to sustain upward price momentum and could fuel substantial prop up to see $5,000. This inherent synergy is bound to grow between these two tokens, as RXS continues its presale journey on the Ethereum blockchain. As a result of this infrastructure, Ethereum becomes RXS’s starting point as they take a new approach to asset management based on tokenization. This relationship strengthens RXS’s credibility and appeal to investors that are already well accustomed with Ethereum’s ability. As ETH and RXS are expected to make considerable gains in early 2025, with ETH likely to surpass new all time highs and RXS potentially multiplying its value, the upcoming period is looking very exciting for cryptocurrency investment. Conclusion: A Promising Outlook Ethereum and RXS looks to be in good shape as we head into 2025. Investors are closely watching Ethereum’s movement as the crypto is primed to break out above $5,000, aided by strong market dynamics coupled with institutional support. At the same time, RXS is developing into a compelling solution for those who seek to take advantage of creative financial offerings associated with actual world assets.

2024 Marked by Strategic Repositioning to Spatial Core AI and Cloud Based Revenues, Significant DoD Contracts, and Positioning Toward Revenue Growth and Profitability NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / December 17, 2024 / The Glimpse Group, Inc. ("Glimpse") (NASDAQ:VRAR)(FSE:9DR), a diversified Immersive Technology platform company providing enterprise-focused Virtual Reality ("VR"), Augmented Reality ("AR") and Spatial Computing software and services, today issued a letter to shareholders from its President & CEO, Lyron Bentovim, summarizing key Glimpse developments for Calendar Year 2024. Dear Shareholders: 2024 was a transformational year for Glimpse, in which we made significant strides in our strategic transition to focus on providing enterprise-scale Spatial Computing, Cloud and AI driven Immersive middleware software and solutions ("Spatial Core") - led by our subsidiary company Brightline Interactive. This successful transition included major contracts with leading U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") and other large entities, while working directly with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cesium and many others. In parallel, we streamlined our organizational structure and reached a point where we are cash flow profitable from operations. We achieved this milestone without raising capital and while maintaining a clean balance sheet with no debt, converts or preferreds. In fact, we expect our cash balance on December 31, 2024 to match and potentially exceed our cash balance on September 30, 2024 - the first time that has occurred in our history as a public company from internal operations only. The Immersive industry itself also made important progress in 2024, with major initiatives and products announced by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Nvidia, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Samsung (KS:005930), Snap and others. These bode well for the Immersive industry in general and for Glimpse in particular. Spatial Core Summary: In 2023 we commenced on a strategic transition, focusing our investment on Spatial Core. This transition was largely completed during 2024 and Spatial Core is now Glimpse's primary growth engine and value driver. Spatial Core has tremendous potential and has gained strong traction during the year. We are working with some of the leading companies in the world to develop the Immersive middleware that takes in huge amounts of 2D data, creates detailed and life-like digital twins in 3D and then on top of that 3D data makes complex computations inside the digital twin environment while also adding important utility functions, all via the Cloud, in large scale and in real time.Spatial Core is highly relevant and powerful in industries where there is complex 2D data that can be utilized far more effectively in a 3D setting with multiple use cases in Enterprises, Manufacturing, Engineering/Architecture, Oil/Gas, Robotics as well as in Government and the Military.AI is a key element in Spatial Core:Automate the generation of digital twin environments - 2D to 3D, utilizing machine learning and computer vision.Generative AI inside a Spatial Environment - utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to ask functional questions about a descriptive environment. For example, "If I place a building in this location, will I be able to see the other building".Neuro Learning Networks - learn in an immersive environment by performing a function repeatedly, based on visual inputs, and then distribute that learning to all other participants. For example, robots learning to do complex tasks.These AI capabilities, combined with the vast and real time computing available via the Cloud, and delivered via 5G networks are transformative in our ability to create complex and powerful simulations and scenarios, in a cost effective, scalable and effective manner.I encourage you to view the Spatial Core webinar we hosted earlier this year: "The intersection of AI and Spatial Computing, bringing the power of bringing AI into the 3D world": https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2934/51186 Examples of Spatial Core traction include:Signed a $4MM+, 12-month contract with a Department of Defense entity for a Spatial Computing ecosystem, integrating AI workflows and accelerated compute for a variety of defense use-cases.Entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Center, to develop, assess and improve workflows to create and augment synthetic imagery for use in training and assessing AI and machine learning Machine learning algorithms.Extended partnership with a Fortune 500 government Systems Integrator for VR Training in Digital Twin Environments to a key U.S. government agency with over 45,000 employees on a mid six figure contract.Brightline Interactive, Cesium & NVIDIA teamed up at the GEOspatial INTelligence Symposium 2024 to introduce Brightline's Spatial Core which uses AI workflows for complex computations on top of real life data sets, enabling powerful real time, massive data driven, digital twin and simulation applications.Successfully Completed the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division for the adaptation of immersive technologies.Completed a contract to support a major immersive technology hardware provider to accelerate their computing interfaces into GPU-enabled cloud, with streaming and visualization capabilities.We are at an advanced stage of securing several additional multi-million dollar Spatial Core contracts with multiple Government, DoD and large enterprise customers. The short-term aggregate value for these contracts is in the $5-10 million range.Each of these potential contracts has significant growth elements built into them that could lead to significant annual recurring software revenue once the original contracts have been successfully performed.Other Glimpse Entities Summary: In parallel to Spatial Core, our other Immersive businesses continued their positive momentum. Some examples:Foretell Reality entered into a 6-figure partnership with a large University to develop an AI-driven VR training system enabling students and trainees to learn various professional skills through conversation-centric simulations with an AI-based avatar in different immersive settings.Glimpse Learning entered into a two year, mid-six figure contract with the College of Staten Island CUNY ("CSI") Technology Incubator for the design, deployment and integration of a suite of immersive technologies in its new Innovation Hub. This is a cross Glimpse effort, with a significant software license componentIn recent months, we have experienced an increase in our revenues with Snap for AR 3D models and lenses.Sector 5 Digital ("S5D") entered into a 6-figure engagement with one of the world's largest architecture firms to visualize in AR the new business campus of a multinational retail company; a mid-six figure contract with a global water and hygiene infrastructure company for an augmented reality (AR) solution; and a mid-six figure contract with a global energy company for Immersive content.Glimpse Learning entered into a multi year, mid-six figure contract with a state district for Immersive education.Immersive Industry: While the Immersive industry, and Glimpse as a significant participant in it, has faced challenging headwinds over the past two years, we are now seeing and experiencing concrete positive growth indicators in both our business and the Immersive industry. We believe that the Immersive industry is poised for significant growth, driven by:Meta's VR gaming platform continues to grow, and their new Ray-Ban AI glasses have exceeded expectations, demonstrating consumer appetite for discreet wearable tech.Apple boldly entered the headset market with the Vision Pro, its initial Spatial headset, signaling their intent to lead the next digital era.Samsung's recent re-entry to the market, leveraging Google's new Immersive operating system, signals a competitive resurgence and further industry maturation.Perhaps the most significant development lies in Meta's "Orion" concept AR headset. This vision of seamlessly integrating digital experiences into the real world represents a fundamental shift in human-computer interaction. This vision is directly correlated with our vison for Spatial Core.Specifically, as it relates to Spatial Core, the following are key industry developments:Matured AR Cloud and Interoperable Standards for Enterprise and Government Workflows: standardized "AR Cloud"- open standards and protocols enable seamless interoperability, allowing different contractors, departments, and partners to integrate and share geospatial data, maintenance records, and situational guidance without being locked into proprietary ecosystems.Enhanced On-Device Spatial AI for Operational Efficiency and Security: Spatial computing devices can now perform advanced AI-driven tasks directly on their own hardware, enabling real-time environmental understanding, object recognition, and anomaly detection without constant cloud connectivity. Use cases: secure border monitoring, emergency response planning, infrastructure maintenance and technical troubleshooting.Industry-Grade Mixed Reality Headsets and Toolchains for Scalable Enterprise Solutions: High-performance mixed reality headsets, offering comfortable wearability, robust tracking, and industrial-grade durability, became standard gear in many professional fields letting enterprises rapidly create, deploy, and maintain applications - ranging from advanced training simulations for defense personnel to augmented production workflows for automotive manufacturing lines.We believe that these industry developments, coupled with ongoing technological advancements, position the Immersive industry for potential rapid adoption and substantial market expansion in upcoming years. 2025 Expectations:Looking forward, we expect overall revenues to be significantly higher in the coming quarters compared to the past year, resulting in above $3 million/Q revenue on average in the coming quarters. We expect that revenues for 2025 will be well above our revenues for 2024 (for reference, we previously disclosed that we expect our aggregate revenue for FY '25 - ending June 30, 2025 - to be in the $11-12 million range). This expected growth will be primarily driven by an increase in Spatial Core revenues, as well as potential growth in our other businesses.Our Gross Margin should continue to be in the 60-70% range.Post operational restructuring, our current operating cash expense base (pre revenue) is now less than $1 million per month.We expect to be cash flow positive and increase our cash balance throughout the upcoming calendar year, without the need for a capital raise.VRAR StockThe transformational and positive developments achieved in 2024 are not currently reflected in our stock price, creating what we believe is a very significant disconnect between our intrinsic value and our public company valuation.We have a strong position in the Immersive technology segment, AI and Cloud driven revenues, large enterprise and DoD customers, relationships with some of the most successful tech companies in the world, strong pipeline of growing revenues, high gross margins, positive expected cash flow, a clean balance sheet, 10 issued Immersive patents, etc. - yet we have an extremely low market cap and consistent selling pressure on the stock. In essence, we are an abandoned "Nano-Cap" but with top tier customers, partners, IP and technology in an exciting growth industry.The management, board and co-founders of the Company own approximately 33% of the outstanding shares. This group has never sold a share in the Company's history, even after the Glimpse's IPO in 2021, and is determined to maximize shareholder value. It is also a key reason why Glimpse continues to maintain a clean capital structure with no debt, no convertible debt and no preferred equity - a rarity in public companies of our size.This valuation disconnect has had, and continues to have, a substantial negative impact on our ability to execute on our growth strategy. As such, the Board of Directors of the Company is exploring various aggressive strategic options to enable the business to be in a position to invest in its growth while unlocking the value inherent in our business and/or assets and may pursue such options in the future.Summary Remarks We have made major strides over the past year in repositioning and restructuring Glimpse strategically and operationally. It's an exciting time for the Immersive industry, Glimpse is positioned as a leading provider of enterprise Immersive software and services, and we are poised for revenue growth and cash profitability. However, this is not reflected in our stock price, to the great detriment of our growth potential and shareholders. Going forward, we are going to continue our focus on profitable growth and in parallel aggressively explore all strategic options with the goal of unlocking the value of our business and/or underlying assets. I thank you all for your interest in and support of Glimpse, and wish you all a nice holiday season and a happy and healthy 2025. Lyron L.

Time Published: 2024-12-17T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
In the last year, I’ve spent about 200,000 words on a kind of personal journey where I’ve tried again and again to work out why everything digital feels so broken, and why it seems to keep getting worse, despite what tech’s “brightest” minds might promise. More regularly than not, I’ve found that the answer is fairly simple: the tech industry’s incentives no longer align with the user. The people running the majority of internet services have used a combination of monopolies and a cartel-like commitment to growth-at-all-costs thinking to make war with the user, turning the customer into something between a lab rat and an unpaid intern, with the goal to juice as much value from the interaction as possible. To be clear, tech has always had an avaricious streak, and it would be naive to suggest otherwise, but this moment feels different. I’m stunned by the extremes tech companies are going to extract value from customers, but also by the insidious way they’ve gradually degraded their products. To be clear, I don’t believe that this gradual enshittification is part of some grand, Machiavellian long game by the tech companies, but rather the product of multiple consecutive decisions made in response to short-term financial needs. Even if it was, the result would be the same — people wouldn’t notice how bad things have gotten until it’s too late, or they might just assume that tech has always sucked, or they’re just personally incapable of using the tools that are increasingly fundamental to living in a modern world. You are the victim of a con — one so pernicious that you’ve likely tuned it out despite the fact it’s part of almost every part of your life. It hurts everybody you know in different ways, and it hurts people more based on their socioeconomic status. It pokes and prods and twists millions of little parts of your life, and it’s everywhere, so you have to ignore it, because complaining about it feels futile, like complaining about the weather. It isn’t. You’re battered by the Rot Economy, and a tech industry that has become so obsessed with growth that you, the paying customer, are a nuisance to be mitigated far more than a participant in an exchange of value. A death cult has taken over the markets, using software as a mechanism to extract value at scale in the pursuit of growth at the cost of user happiness. These people want everything from you — to control every moment you spend working with them so that you may provide them with more ways to make money, even if doing so doesn’t involve you getting anything else in return. Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and a majority of tech platforms are at war with the user, and, in the absence of any kind of consistent standards or effective regulations, the entire tech ecosystem has followed suit. A kind of Coalition of the Willing of the worst players in hyper-growth tech capitalism. Things are being made linearly worse in the pursuit of growth in every aspect of our digital lives, and it’s because everything must grow, at all costs, at all times, unrelentingly, even if it makes the technology we use every day consistently harmful. This year has, on some level, radicalized me, and today I’m going to explain why. It’s going to be a long one, because I need you to fully grasp the seriousness and widespread nature of the problem. You have, more than likely, said to yourself sometime in the last ten years that you “didn’t get tech,” or that you are “getting too old,” or that tech has “gotten away from you” because you found a service, or an app, or a device annoying. You, or someone you love, have convinced yourself that your inability to use something is a sign that you’re deficient, that you’ve failed to “keep up with the times,” as if the things we use every day should be in a constant state of flux. The tools we use in our daily lives outside of our devices have mostly stayed the same. While buttons on our cars might have moved around — and I’m not even getting into Tesla’s designs right now — we generally have a brake, an accelerator, a wheel, and a turn signal. Boarding an airplane has worked mostly the same way since I started flying, other than moving from physical tickets to digital ones. We’re not expected to work out “the new way to use a toilet” every few months because somebody decided we were finishing too quickly. Yet our apps and the platforms we use every day operate by a totally different moral and intellectual compass. While the idea of an update is fairly noble (and not always negative) — that something you’ve bought can be maintained and improved over time is a good thing — many tech platforms see it as a means to further extract and exploit, to push users into doing things that either keep them on the app longer or take more-profitable actions. We as a society need to reckon with how this twists us up, makes us more paranoid, more judgmental, more aggressive, more reactionary, because when everything is subtly annoying, we all simmer and suffer in manifold ways. There is no digital world and physical world — they are, and have been, the same for quite some time, and reporting on tech as if this isn’t the case fails the user. It may seem a little dramatic, but take a second and really think about how many little digital irritations you deal with in a day. It’s time to wake up to the fact that our digital lives are rotten. I’m not talking about one single product or company, but most digital experiences. The interference is everywhere, and we’ve all learned to accept conditions that are, when written out plainly, are kind of insane. Back in 2023, Spotify redesigned its app to, and I quote The Verge, be “part TikTok, part Instagram, and part YouTube,” which in practice meant replacing a relatively clean and straightforward user interface with one made up of full-screen cards (like TikTok) and autoplaying video podcasts (like TikTok), which CEO Daniel Ek claimed would, to quote Sky News, make the platform “come alive” with different content on a platform built and sold as a place to listen to music. The tech media waved off the redesign without really considering the significance of the fact that at the drop of a hat, hundreds of millions of people’s experience of listening to music would change based on the whims of a multi-billionaire, with the express purpose being to force these people to engage with completely different content as a means of increasing engagement metrics and revenue. By all means try and pretend this is “just an app,” but people’s relationships with music and entertainment are deeply important to their moods and motivations, and adding layers of frustration in an app they interact with for hours a day is consistently grating. And no matter how you feel, this design was never for the customer. Nobody using Spotify was saying “ah man, I wish I could watch videos on this,” but that doesn’t matter because engagement and revenue must increase. It’s clear that Spotify, a company best-known for exploiting the artists on its platform, treats its customers (both paying and otherwise) with a similar level of contempt. It’s far from alone. Earlier in the year, smart speaker company Sonos released a redesign of its app that removed accessibility features and the ability to edit song queues or play music from your phone in an attempt to “modernize” the interface, with WIRED suggesting that the changes could potentially open the door to adding a subscription of some sort to help Sonos’ ailing growth. Meta’s continual redesigns of Facebook and Instagram — the latest of which happened in October to “focus on Gen Z” — are probably the most egregious example of the constant chaos of our digital lives. As every single platform we use is desperate to juice growth from every user, everything we interact with is hyper-monetized through plugins, advertising, microtransactions and other things that constantly gnaw at the user experience. We load websites expecting them to be broken, especially on mobile, because every single website has to have 15+ different ad trackers, video ads that cover large chunks of the screen, all while demanding our email or for us to let them send us notifications. Every experience demands our email address, and giving out our email address adds another email to inboxes already stuffed with two types of spam — the actual “get the biggest laser” spam that hits the junk folder automatically, and the marketing emails we receive from clothing brands we wanted a discount from or newspapers we pay for that still feel it’s necessary to bother us 3 to 5 times a day. I’ve basically given up trying to fight back — how about you? Every app we use is intentionally built to “growth hack” — a term that means “moving things around in such a way that a user does things that we want them to do” so they spend more money or time on the platform — which is why dating apps gate your best matches behind $1.99 microtransactions, or why Uber puts “suggestions” and massive banners throughout their apps to try and convince you to use one of its other apps (or accidentally hit them, which gives Uber a chance to get you to try them), or why Outlook puts advertisements in your email inbox that are near-indistinguishable from new emails (they’re at the top of your inbox too), or why Meta’s video carousels intentionally only play the first few seconds of a clip as a means of making you click. Our digital lives are actively abusive and hostile, riddled with subtle and overt cons. Our apps are ever-changing, adapting not to our needs or conditions, but to the demands of investors and internal stakeholders that have reduced who we are and what we do to an ever-growing selection of manipulatable metrics. It isn’t that you don’t “get” tech, it’s that the tech you use every day is no longer built for you, and as a result feels a very specific kind of insane. Every app has a different design, almost every design is optimized based on your activity on said app, with each app trying to make you do different things in uniquely annoying ways. Meta has hundreds of people on its growth team perpetuating a culture that manipulates and tortures users to make company metrics improve, like limiting the amount of information in a notification to make a user browse deeper into the site, and deliberately promoting low-quality clickbait that promises “one amazing trick” because people click those links, even if they suck. It’s everywhere. After a coup by head of ads Prabhakar Raghavan in 2019, Google intentionally made search results worse as a means of increasing the amount of times that people would search for something on the site. Ever wonder why your workplace uses Sharepoint and other horrible Microsoft apps? That’s because Microsoft’s massive software monopoly meant that it was cheaper for your boss to buy all of it in one place, and thus its incentive is to make it good enough to convince your boss to sign up for all of their stuff rather than an app that makes your life easier or better. Why does every website feel different, and why do some crash randomly or make your phone burn your hand? It’s because every publisher has pumped their sites full of as much ad tracking software as possible as a means of monetizing every single user in as many ways as possible, helping ads follow you across the entire internet. And why does everybody need your email? Because your inbox is one of the few places that advertisers haven’t found a consistent way to penetrate. It’s digital tinnitus. It’s the pop-up from a shopping app that you downloaded to make one purchase, or the deceptive notification from Instagram that you have “new views” that doesn’t actually lead anywhere. It is the autoplaying video advertisement on your film review website. It is the repeated request for you to log back into a newspaper website that you logged into yesterday because everyone must pay and nothing must get through. It is the hundredth Black Friday sale you got from a company that you swear you unsubscribed from eight times, and perhaps even did, but there’s no real way to keep track. It’s the third time this year you’ve had to make a new password because another data breach happened and the company didn’t bother to encrypt it. I’m not writing this to complain, but because I believe — as I hinted at a few weeks ago — that we are in the midst of the largest-scale ecological disaster of our time, because almost every single interaction with technology, which is required to live in modern society, has become actively adversarial to the user. These issues hit everything we do, all the time, a constant onslaught of interference, and I believe it’s so much bigger than just social media and algorithms — though they’re a big part of it, of course. In plain terms, everybody is being fucked with constantly in tiny little ways by most apps and services, and I believe that billions of people being fucked with at once in all of these ways has profound psychological and social consequences that we’re not meaningfully discussing. The average person’s experience with technology is one so aggressive and violative that I believe it leaves billions of people with a consistent low-grade trauma. We seem, as a society, capable of understanding that social media can hurt us, unsettle us, or make us feel crazed and angry, but I think it’s time to accept that the rest of the tech ecosystem undermines our wellbeing in an equally-insidious way. And most people don’t know it’s happening, because everybody has accepted deeply shitty conditions for the last ten years. Now, some of you may scoff at this a little — after all, you’re smart, you know about disinformation, you know about the tricks of these companies, and thus most people do, right? Wrong! Most people don’t think about the things they’re doing at all and are just trying to get by in a society that increasingly demands we make more money to buy the same things, with our lives both interfered with and judged by social networks with aggressive algorithms that feed us more things based on what we’ll engage with, which might mean said things piss us off or actively radicalize us. They’re nagged by constant notifications — an average of 46 a day — some useful, some advertisements, like Apple telling us there’s a nailbiter college football game regardless of whether we’ve ever interacted with anything football related, or a Slack message saying you haven’t joined a group you were invited to yet, or Etsy letting you know that you can buy things for an upcoming holiday. It’s relentless, and the more time you invest in using a device, the more of these notifications you get, making you less likely to turn them off. After all, how well are you doing keeping your inbox clean? Oh what’s that? You get 25 emails a day, many of them from a company owned by William Sonoma? Your work software veers between “shit” and “just okay,” and never really seems to get better, nor does any part seem to smoothly connect to another. Your organization juggles anywhere from five to fifteen different pieces of software — Slack or Microsoft Teams and/or Zoom for communication, Asana or Monday or Basecamp for project management, or Jira, or Trello, or any number of other different ways that your organization or team wants to plan things. When you connect with another organization, you find they’re using a different product, or perhaps they’re using the same one — say, Slack — and that one requires you to join their organization, which may or may not work. I’m not even talking about the innumerable amount of tech infrastructure products that more-technical workers have to deal with, or how much worse this gets if you’ve got a slower device. Every organization does things differently, and some don’t put a lot of thought into how they do so. Yet beyond the endless digital nags there’s the need to be constantly aware of scams and outright misinformation, both on social networks that don’t really care to stop it and on the chum box advertisements below major news publications — you know, the little weird stories at the bottom promising miracle cures. It’s easy to assume that it’s natural that you’d know there are entities out there trying to scam you or trick you, and I’d argue most people don’t. To most, a video from Rumble.com may as well be the same thing as a video from CNN.com, and most people would believe that every advertisement on every website is somehow verified for its accuracy, versus “sold at scale all the time to whoever will pay the money.” And when I say that, I’m really talking about CNN.com, a website that had 594 million visitors in October 2024. At the bottom is the “Paid Partner Content” section, including things from publications ‘like “FinanceBuzz” that tell you about the “9 Dumbest Things Smart People Waste Money On.” FinanceBuzz immediately asks for you to turn your notifications on — you know, so it can ping you when it has new articles — and each bullet point leads to one of its affiliate marketing arms trying to sell you car insurance and credit cards. You’re offered the chance to share your email address to receive “vetted side hustles and proven ways to earn extra cash sent to your inbox,” which I assume includes things like advertorial content telling you that yes, you could make money playing online bingo (such as “Bingo Cash”) against other people. Papaya Games, developer of Bingo Cash, was sued in March by rival gaming company Skillz for using bots in allegedly skill-based games that are supposed to be between humans, and the Michigan Gaming Control Board issued a cease-and-desist order against the company for violating multiple gaming laws, including the Lawful Internet Gaming Act. To quote the lawsuit, “Papaya’s games are not skill-based and users are often not playing against live, actual opponents but against Papaya’s own bots that direct and rig the game so that Papaya itself wins its users’ money while leading them to believe that they lost to a live human opponent.” This is a website and its associated content that has prime placement on the front page of a major news outlet. As a normal person, it’s reasonable to believe that CNN would not willfully allow advertisements for websites that are, in and of themselves, further advertisements masquerading as trustworthy third party entities. It’s reasonable that you would believe that FinanceBuzz was a reputable website, and that its intentions were to share great deals and secret tricks with you. If you think you’re not this stupid, you are privileged and need to have more solidarity with your fellow human beings. Why wouldn’t you think that the content on one of the most notable media outlets in the entire world is trustworthy? Why wouldn’t you trust that CNN, a respected media outlet, had vetted its advertisers and made sure their content wasn’t actively tricking its users? I think it’s fair to say that CNN has likely led to thousands of people being duped by questionable affiliate marketing companies, and likely profited from doing so. Why wouldn’t people feel insane? Why wouldn’t the internet, where we’re mostly forced to live, drive most people crazy? How are we not discussing the fact that so much of the internet is riddled with poison? How are we not treating the current state of the tech industry like an industrial chemical accident? Is it because there are too many people at fault? Is it because fixing it would require us to truly interrogate the fabric of a capitalist death cult? Nothing I am writing is polemic or pessimistic or describing anything other than the shit that’s happening in front of my eyes and your eyes and the eyes of billions of people. Dismissing these things as “just how it is” allows powerful people with no real plan and no real goals other than growth to thrive, and sneering at people “dumb enough” to get tricked by an internet and tech industry built specifically to trick them suggests you have no idea how you are being scammed, because you’re smug and arrogant. I need you to stop trying to explain away how fucking offensive using the internet and technology has become. I need you to stop making excuses for the powerful and consider the sheer scale of the societal ratfucking happening on almost every single device in the world, and consider the ramifications of the difficulty that a human being using the internet has trying to live an honest, dignified and reasonable life. To exist in modern society requires you to use these devices, or otherwise sacrifice large parts of how you’d interact with other people. You need a laptop or a smartphone for work, for school, for anything really. You need messaging apps otherwise you don’t exist. As a result, there is a societal monopoly of sorts — or perhaps it’s more of a cartel, in the sense that, for the most part, every tech company has accepted these extremely aggressive, anti-user positions, all in pursuit of growth. The stakes are so much higher than anyone — especially the tech media — is willing to discuss. The extent of the damage, the pain, the frustration, the terror is so constant that we are all on some level numb to its effects, because discussing it requires accepting that the vast majority of people live poisoned digital lives. We all live in the ruins created by the Rot Economy, where the only thing that matters is growth. Growth of revenue, growth of the business, growth of metrics related to the business, growth of engagement, of clicks, of time on app, of purchases of micro-transactions, of impressions of ads, of things done that make executives feel happy. I’ll give you a more direct example. On November 21, I purchased the bestselling laptop from Amazon — a $238 Acer Aspire 1 with a four-year-old Celeron N4500 Processor, 4GB of DDR4 RAM, and 128GB of slow eMMC storage (which is, and I’m simplifying here, though not by much, basically an SD card soldered to the computer’s motherboard). Affordable and under-powered, I’d consider this a fairly representative sample of how millions of people interact with the internet. I believe it’s also a powerful illustration of the damage caused by the Rot Economy, and the abusive, exploitative way in which the tech industry treats people at scale. It took 1 minute and 50 seconds from hitting the power button for the laptop to get to the setup screen. It took another minute and a half to connect and begin downloading updates, which took several more minutes. After that, I was faced with a licensing agreement where I agreed to binding arbitration to use Windows, a 24 second pause, and then got shown a screen of different “ways I could unlock my Microsoft experience,” with animations that shuddered and jerked violently. Throughout, the laptop’s cheap trackpad would miss every few clicks. At this point, I was forced to create a Microsoft account and to hand over my cellphone number — or another email address — to receive a code, or I wouldn’t be able to use the laptop. Each menu screen takes 3-5 seconds to load, and I’m asked to “customize my experience” with things like “personalized ads, tips and recommendations,” with every option turned on by default, then to sign up for another account, this time with Acer. At one point I am simply shown an ad for Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud storage product with a QR code to download it on my phone, and then I’m told that Windows has to download a few updates, which I assume are different to the last time it did that. It has taken, at this point, around 20 minutes to get to this screen. It takes another 33 minutes for the updates to finish, and then another minute and 57 seconds to log in, at which point it pops up with a screen telling me to “set up my browser and discover the best of Windows,” including “finding the apps I love from the Microsoft Store” and the option to “create an AI-generated theme for your browser.” The laptop constantly struggles as I scroll through pages, the screen juddering, apps taking several seconds to load. When I opened the start bar — ostensibly a place where you have apps you’d use — I saw some things that felt familiar, like Outlook, an email client that is not actually installed and requires you to download it, and an option for travel website Booking.com, along with a link to LinkedIn. One app, ClipChamp, was installed but immediately needed to be updated, which did not work when I hit “update,” forcing me to go to find the updates page, which showed me at least 40 different apps called things like “SweetLabs Inc.” I have no idea what any of this stuff is. I type “sweetlabs” into the search bar, and it jankily interrupts into a menu that takes up a third of the screen, with half of that dedicated to “Mark Twain’s birthday,” two Mark Twain-related links, a “quiz of the day,” and four different games available for download. The computer pauses slightly every time I type a letter. Every animation shudders. Even moving windows around feels painful. It is clunky, slow, it feels cheap, and the operating system — previously something I’d considered to be “the thing that operates the computer system” — is actively rotten, strewn with ads, sponsored content, suggested apps, and intrusive design choices that make the system slower and actively upset the user. The reason I’m explaining this in such agonizing detail is that this experience is more indicative of the average person’s experience using a computer than anybody realizes. Though it’s tough to gauge how many of these things sold to make it a bestseller on Amazon, laptops in this pricepoint, with this specific version of Windows (Windows 11 Home in “S Mode” as discussed above), happen to dominate Amazon’s bestsellers along with Apple’s significantly-more-expensive MacBook Air and Pro series. It is reasonable to believe that a large amount of the laptops sold in America match this price point and spec — there are two similar ones on Best Buy’s bestsellers, and as of writing this sentence, multiple different laptops of this spec are on the front of Target’s laptop page. And if I haven’t made it completely clear, this means that millions of people are likely using a laptop that’s burdensomely slow, and full of targeted advertisements and content baked into the operating system in a way that’s either impossible or difficult to remove. For millions of people — and it really could be tens of millions considering the ubiquity of these laptops in eCommerce stores alone — the experience of using the computer is both actively exploitative and incredibly slow. Even loading up MSN.com — the very first page you see when you open a web browser — immediately hits you with ads for eBay, QVC and QuickBooks, with icons that sometimes simply don’t load. Every part of the operating system seems to be hounding you to use some sort of Microsoft product or some sort of product that Microsoft or the laptop manufacturer has been paid to make you see. While one can hope that the people buying these laptops have any awareness of anything, the reality is that they’re being dumped into a kind of TJ Maxx version of computing, except TJ Maxx clothes don’t sometimes scream at you to download TJ Maxx Plus or stop functioning because you used them too fast. Again, this is how most people are experiencing modern computing, and it isn’t because this is big business — it’s because laptop sales have been falling for over a decade, and manufacturers (and Microsoft) need as many ways to grow revenue as possible, even if the choices they make are actively harmful to consumers. At that point, said person using this laptop can now log onto the internet, and begin using websites like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, all of which have algorithms we don’t really understand, but that have been regularly proven to be actively — and deliberately — manipulative and harmful. Now, I know reading about “algorithms” and “manipulation” makes some people’s eyes glaze over, but I want you to take a simpler approach for a second. I hypothesize that most people do not really think about how they interact with stuff — they load up YouTube, they type something in, they watch it, and maybe they click whatever is recommended next. They may know there’s an algorithm of sorts, but they’re not really sitting there thinking “okay so they want me to see this,” or they may even be grateful that the algorithm gave them something they like, and reinforce the algorithm with their own biases, some of which they might have gotten from the algorithm. To be clear, none of this is mind control or hypnosis or voodoo. These algorithms and their associated entities are not sitting there with some vast agenda to execute — the algorithms are built to keep you on the website, even if it upsets you, pisses you off, or misinforms you. Their incentive isn’t really to make you make any one choice, other than one that involves you staying on their platform or interacting with an advertisement for somebody else’s, and the heavy flow of political — and particularly conservative — content is a result of platforms knowing that’s what keeps people doing stuff on the platform. The algorithms are constantly adapting in real time to try and find something that you might spend time on, with little regard for whether that content is good, let alone good for you. Putting aside any moral responsibility, the experiences on these apps are discordant. Facebook, as I’ve written about in detail, is a complete nightmare — thousands of people being actively conned in supposed “help groups,” millions of people being scammed every day (with one man killing himself as a result of organized crime’s presence on Facebook), and bizarre AI slop is dominating feeds with Mark Zuckerberg promising that there’s more to come. That’s without mentioning a product experience that continually interrupts you with sponsored and suggested content, as these platforms always do, all algorithmically curated to keep you scrolling, while also hiding content from the people you care about, because Facebook thinks it won’t keep you on the platform for as long. The picture I am trying to paint is one of terror and abuse. The average person’s experience of using a computer starts with aggressive interference delivered in a shoddy, sludge-like frame, and as the wider internet opens up to said user, already battered by a horrible user experience, they’re immediately thrown into heavily-algorithmic feeds each built to con them, feeding whatever holds their attention and chucking ads in as best they can. As they browse the web, websites like NBCnews.com feature stories from companies like “WorldTrending.com” with advertisements for bizarre toys written in the style of a blog, so intentional in their deceit that the page in question has a huge disclaimer at the bottom saying it’s an ad. As their clunky, shuddering laptop hitches between every scroll, they go to ESPN.com, and the laptop slows to a crawl. Everything slows to a crawl. “God damnit, why is everything so fucking slow? I’ll just stay on Facebook or Instagram or YouTube. At least that place doesn’t crash half the time or trick me.” Using the computer in the modern age is so inherently hostile that it pushes us towards corporate authoritarians like Apple, Microsoft, Google and Meta — and now that every single website is so desperate for our email and to show us as many ads as possible, it’s either harmful or difficult for the average person to exist online. The biggest trick that these platforms played wasn’t any one algorithm, but the convenience of a “clean” digital experience — or, at least as clean as they feel it needs to be. In an internet so horribly poisoned by growth capitalism, these platforms show a degree of peace and consistency, even if they’re engineered to manipulate you, even if the experience gets worse seemingly every year, because at least it isn’t as bad as the rest of the internet. We use Gmail because, well, at least it’s not Outlook. We use YouTube to view videos from other websites because other websites are far more prone to crash, have quality issues, or simply don’t work on mobile. We use Google Search, despite the fact that it barely works anymore, to find things because actually browsing the web fucking sucks. When every single website needs to make as much money as possible because their private equity or hedge fund or massive corporate owners need to make more money every year without fail, the incentives of building the internet veer away from providing a service and toward putting you, the reader, in silent service of a corporation. ESPN’s app is a fucking mess — autoplaying videos, discordantly-placed scores, menus that appear to have been designed by M.C. Escher — and nothing changes because Disney needs you to use the app and find what you need, versus provide information in anything approaching a sensible way. It needs your effort. The paid subscription model for dating apps is so aggressive that there’s a lawsuit filed against Match Group — which owns Tinder and Hinge, and thus a great deal of the market — for “gamifying the platforms to transform users into gamblers locked in a search for psychological rewards,” likely as a means of recouping revenue after user numbers have begun to fall. And if you’re curious why these companies aren’t just making their products less horrible to use, I’m afraid that would reduce revenue, which is what they do care about. If you’re wondering who else is okay with that, it’s Apple. Both Bumble and Tinder are regularly featured on the “Must-Have Apps” section of the App Store, most of which require a monthly fee to work. Each of these apps is run by a company with a “growth” team, and that team exists, on some level, to manipulate you — to move icons around so that you’ll interact with the things they want you to, see ads, or buy things. This is why HBO Max rebranded to Max and created an entirely new app experience — because the growth people said “if we do this in this way the people using it will do what we want.” Now, what’s important to accept here is that absolutely none of this is done with any real consideration of the wider effects on the customer, as long as the customer continues doing the things that the company needs them to. We, as people, have been trained to accept a kind of digital transience — an inherent knowledge that things will change at random, that the changes may suck, and that we will just have to accept them because that’s how the computer works, and these companies work hard to suppress competition as a means of making sure they can do what they want. In other words, internet users are perpetually thrown into a tornado of different corporate incentives, and the less economically stable or technologically savvy you are, the more likely you are to be at the mercy of them. Every experience is different, wants something, wants you to do something, and the less people know about why the more likely they are to — with good intentions — follow the paths laid out in front of them with little regard for what might be happening, in the same way people happily watch the same TV shows or listen to the same radio stations. Even if you’re technologically savvy, you’re still dealing with these problems — fresh installs of Windows on new laptops, avoiding certain websites because you’ve learned what the dodgy ones look like, not interacting with random people in your DMs because you know what a spam bot looks like, and so on. It’s not that you’re immune. It’s that you’re instinctually ducking and weaving around an internet and digital ecosystem that continually tries to interrupt you, batting away pop-ups and silencing notifications knowing that they want something from you — and I need you to realize that most people are not like you and are actively victimized by the tech ecosystem. As I said a few weeks ago, I believe that most people are continually harmed by their daily lives, as most people’s daily lives are on the computer or their smartphones, and those lives have been stripped of dignity. When they look to the media for clarity or validation, the best they’ll get is a degree of “hmm, maybe algorithm bad?” rather than a wholehearted acceptance that the state of our digital lives is obscene. Yet it’s not just the algorithms — It’s the entirety of the digital ecosystem, from websites to apps to the devices we use every day. The fact that so many people likely use a laptop that is equal parts unfit for the task and stuffed full of growth hacked poison is utterly disgraceful, because it means that the only way to escape said poison is to simply have more money. Those who can’t afford $300 (at least) phones or $600 laptops are left to use offensively bad technology, and we have, at a societal scale, simply accepted that this is how things go. Yet even on expensive devices you’re still the victim of algorithmic and growth-hacked manipulation, even if we’re aware of it. Knowing allows you to fight back, even if it’s just to stop yourself being overwhelmed by the mess, and means you can read things that can tell you what new horror we need to avoid next — but you are still the target, you are still receiving hundreds of marketing emails a week, you are still receiving spam calls, you are still unable to use Facebook or Instagram without being bombarded by ads and algorithmically-charged content. I’ve written a lot about how the growth-at-all-costs mindset of The Rot Economy is what directly leads big tech companies to make their products worse, but what I’ve never really quantified is the scale of its damage. Everything I’ve discussed around the chaos and pain of the web is a result of corporations and private equity firms buying media properties and immediately trying to make them grow, each in wildly different ways, all clamouring to be the next New York Times or Variety or other legacy media brand, despite those brands already existing, and the ideas for competing with them usually being built on unsustainably-large staffs and expensive consultants. Almost every single store you visit on the internet has a massive data layer on the background that feeds them data about what’s popular, or where they’re spending the most time on the site, and will in turn change things about their design to subtly encourage you to buy more stuff, all so that more money comes out, no matter the cost. Even if this data isn’t personalized, it’s still powerful, and turns so many experiences into subtle manipulations. Every single weird thing that you’ve experienced with an app or service online is the dread hand of the Rot Economy — the gravitational pull of growth, the demands upon you, the user, to do something. And when everybody is trying to chase growth, nobody is thinking stability, and because everybody is trying to grow, everybody sort of copies everybody else’s ideas, which is why we see microtransactions and invasive ads and annoying tricks that all kind of feel the same in everything, though they’re all subtly different and customized just for that one app. It’s exhausting. For a while, I’ve had the Rot Economy compared to Cory Doctorow’s (excellent) enshittification theory, and I think it’s a great time to compare (and separate) the two. To quote Cory in The Financial Times, Enshittification is “[his] theory explaining how the internet was colonised by platforms, why all those platforms are degrading so quickly and thoroughly, why it matters and what we can do about it.” He describes the three stages of decline: “First, platforms are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves.” I agree with Cory on some levels, but I believe he gives far more credit to the platforms in question than they deserve, and sees far more intention or strategy than really exists. I fundamentally disagree about the business customers even being some elevated class in the equation — as we’ve seen with the Google Ads trial, Google didn’t really give a shit about its business customers to begin with, has always sought a monopoly, and made things worse for whoever it needed to as a means of increasing growth. Perhaps that’s semantics. However, Cory’s theory lacks a real perpetrator beyond corporations that naturally say “alright we’re gonna do Enshittification now, watch this.” Where The Rot Economy separates is that growth is, in and of itself, the force that drives companies to enshittify. While enshittification neatly fits across companies like Spotify and Meta (and their ad-focused business models), it doesn’t really make sense when it comes to things where there isn’t a clear split between business customers and consumers, like Microsoft or Salesforce — because enshittification is ultimately one part of the larger Rot Economy, where everything must grow forever. And I believe the phenomenon that captures both is a direct result of the work of men like Jack Welch and Milton Friedman. The Rot Economy is selfish and potently neoliberal — corporations are bowed down to like gods, and the powerful only seek more, at all times, at all costs, even if said cost is “the company might eventually die because we’ve burned out any value it actually has” or “people are harmed every time they pick up their phone.” The Rot Economy is neoliberalism’s true innovation: a kind of economic cancer that with few reasons to exist beyond “more” and few justifications beyond “if we don’t let it keep growing then everybody’s pensions blow up.” To be clear, Cory is for the most part right. Enshittification successfully encapsulates how the modern web was destroyed in a way that nobody really has. I think it applies in a wide-ranging way to a wide range of tech companies and effects. I, however, believe the wider problem is bigger, and the costs are far greater. It isn’t that “everything is enshittified.” It’s that everybody’s pursuit of growth has changed the incentive behind how we generate value in the world, and software enables a specific kind of growth-lust by creating virtual nation states with their own digital despots. While laws may stop Meta from tearing up people’s houses surrounding its offices on 1 Hacker Way, it can happily reroute traffic and engagement on Facebook and Instagram to make things an iota more profitable. The Rot Economy isn’t simply growth-at-all-costs thinking — it’s a kind-of secular religion, something to believe in, that everything and anything can be more, should be more, must be more, that we are defined only by our pursuit of more growth, and that something that isn’t growing isn’t alive, and is in turn inferior. No, perhaps not a religion. Religions are, for the most part, concerned with the hereafter, and contain an ethical dimension that says your present actions will affect your future — or your eternity. The Rot Economy is, by every metric, defined by its short-termism. I’m not just talking about undermining the long-term success of a business to juice immediate revenue numbers. I’m thinking in broad ecosystem terms. The onslaught of AI-generated content — facilitated, in no small part, by Google and Microsoft — has polluted our information ecosystems. AI-generated images and machine-generated text is everywhere, and it’s impossible to avoid, as there is no reliable way to determine the provenance of a piece of content — with one exception, namely the considered scrutiny of a human. This has irreparably damaged the internet in ways I believe few fully understand. This stuff — websites that state falsehoods because an AI hallucinated, or fake pictures of mushrooms and dogs that now dominate Google Images — is not going away. Like microplastics or PFAS chemicals, they’re with us forever, constantly chipping away at our understanding of reality. These companies unleashed generative AI on the world — or, in the case of Microsoft, facilitated its ascendency — without any consideration of what that would mean for the Internet as an ecosystem. Their concerns were purely short-term. Fiscal. The result? Over-leverage in an industry that has no real path to profitability, burning billions of dollars and the environment - both digital and otherwise - along with it. I’m not saying that this is how everybody thinks, but I am convinced that everybody is burdened by The Rot Economy, and that digital ecosystems allow the poison of growth to find new and more destructive ways to dilute a human being to a series of numbers that can be made to grow or contract in the pursuit of capital. Almost every corner of our lives has been turned into some sort of number, and increasing that number is important to us — bank account balances, sure, but also engagement numbers, followers, number of emails sent and received, open rates on newsletters, how many times something we’ve seen has been viewed, all numbers set by other people that we live our lives by while barely understanding what they mean. Human beings thrive on ways to define themselves, but metrics often rob us of our individuality. Products that boil us down to metrics are likely to fail to account for the true depth of anything they're capturing. The change in incentives toward driving more growth actively pushes out those with long-term thinking. It encourages hiring people who see growth as the driver of a company's success, and in turn investment, research and development into mechanisms for growth, which may sometimes be things that help you, but that isn't necessarily the reason they're doing it. Organisational culture and hiring stops prioritising people that fix customer problems, because that is neither the priority nor, sadly, how one makes a business continue to grow. We are all pushed toward growth — personal growth, professional growth, growth in our network and our societal status — and the terms of this growth are often set by platforms and media outlets that are, in turn, pursuing growth. And as I've discussed, the way the terms of our growth is framed is almost entirely through a digital ecosystem of warring intents and different ways of pursuing growth — some ethical, many not. Societal and cultural pressure is nothing new, but the ways we experience it are now elaborate and chaotic. Our relationships — professional, personal, and romantic — are processed through the funhouse mirror of the platforms, changing in ways both subtle and overt based on the signals we receive from the people we care about, each one twisted and processed through the lens of product managers and growth hackers. Changes to these platforms — even subtle ones — actively change the lives of billions of people, and it feels like we talk about it like being online is some hobbyist pursuit rather than something that many people do more than seeing real people in the real world. I believe that we exist in a continual tension with the Rot Economy and the growth-at-all-costs mindset. I believe that the friction we feel on platforms and apps between what we want to do and what the app wants us to do is one of the most underdiscussed and significant cultural phenomena, where we, despite being customers, are continually berated and conned and swindled. I believe billions of people are in active combat with their devices every day, swiping away notifications, dodging around intrusive apps, agreeing to privacy policies that they don’t understand, desperately trying to find where an option they used to use has been moved to because a product manager has decided that it needed to be somewhere else. I realize it’s tough to conceptualize because it’s so ubiquitous, but how much do you fight with your computer or smartphone every day? How many times does something break? How many times have you downloaded an app and found it didn’t really do the thing you wanted it to? How many times have you wanted to do something simple and found that it’s actually really annoying? How much of your life is dodging digital debris, avoiding scams, ads, apps that demand permissions, and endless menu options that bury the simple things that you’re actually trying to do? You are the victim of a con. You have spent years of your life explaining to yourself and others that “this is just how things are,” accepting conditions that are inherently exploitative and abusive. You are more than likely not deficient, stupid, or “behind the times,” and even if you are, there shouldn’t be multi-billion dollar enterprises that monetize your ignorance. And it’s time to start holding those responsible accountable. I’m fairly regularly asked why this all matters to me so much, so as I wrap up the year, I’m going to try and answer that question, and explain why it is I do what I do. I spent a lot of time alone as a kid. I didn't have friends. I was insular, scared of the world, I felt ostracised and unnoticed, like I was out of place in humanity. The only place I found any kind of community — any kind of real identity — was being online. My life was (and is) defined by technology. Had social networking not come along, I am not confident I’d have made many (if any) lasting friendships. For the first 25 or so years of my life, I struggled to make friends in the real world for a number of reasons, but made so many more online. I kept and nurtured friendships with people thousands of miles away, my physical shyness less of an issue when I could avoid the troublesome “hey I’m Ed” part that tripped me up so much. Without the internet, I’d likely be a resentful hermit, disconnected from humanity, layers of scar tissue over whatever neurodivergence or unfortunate habits I'd gained from a childhood mostly spent alone. Don't feel sorry for me. Technology has allowed me to thrive. I have a business, an upcoming book, this newsletter, and my podcast. I have so many wonderful, beautiful friends who I love that have come exclusively through technology of some sort, likely a social network or the result of a digital connection of some kind. I am immensely grateful for everything I have, and grateful that technology allowed me to live a full and happy life. I imagine many of you feel the same way. Technology has found so many ways to make our lives better, perhaps more in some cases than others. I will never lie and say I don't love it. However, the process of writing this newsletter and recording my podcast has made me intimately aware of the gratuitous, avaricious and intentional harm that the tech industry has caused to its customers, the horrifying and selfish decisions they’ve made, and the ruinous consequences that followed. The things I have watched happen this year alone — which have been at times an enumeration of over a decade of rot — have turned my stomach, as has the outright cowardice of some people that claim to inform the public but choose instead to reinforce the structures of the powerful. I am a user. I am a guy with a podcast and a newsletter, but I am behind the mic and the keyboard a person that uses the same services as you do, and I see the shit done to us, and I feel poison in my veins. I am not holding back, and neither should you. What is being done to us isn't just unfair — it's larcenous, cruel, exploitative and morally wrong. Some may try to dismiss what I'm saying as "just social media" or "just how apps work" and if that's what you truly think, you're either a beaten dog or a willing (or unwilling) operative for the people running the con. I will never forgive these people for what they’ve done to the computer, and the more I learn about both their intentions and actions the more certain I am that they are unrepentant and that their greed will never be sated. I have watched them take the things that made me human — social networking, digital communities, apps, and the other connecting fabric of our digital lives — and turned them into devices of torture, profitable mechanisms of abuse, and find it disgusting how many reporters seem to believe it's their responsibility to thank them and explain why it's good this is happening to their readers. These are the people in charge. These are the people running the tech industry. These are the people who make decisions that affect billions of people every minute of every day, and their decisionmaking is so flagrantly selfish and abusive that I am regularly astonished by how little criticism they receive. These men lace our digital lives with asbestos and get told they’re geniuses for doing so because money comes out. I don’t know — or care — whether these men know who I am or read my work, because I only care that you do. I don't give a shit if Sam Altman or Mark Zuckerberg knows my name. I don't care about any of their riches or their supposed achievements, I care that when given so many resources and opportunities to change the world they chose to make it worse. These men are tantamount to war criminals, except in 30 years Mark Zuckerberg may still be seen as a success — though I will spend the rest of my life telling you the damage he's caused. I care about you. The user. The person reading this. The person that may have felt stupid, or deficient, or ignorant, all because the services you pay for or that monetize you have been intentionally rigged against you. You aren't the failure. The services, the devices, and the executives are. If you cannot see the significance of the problems I discuss every week, the sheer scale of the rot, the sheer damage caused by unregulated and unrepentant managerial parasites, you are living in a fantasy world and I both envy and worry for you. You're the frog in the pot, and trust me, the stove is on. 2025 will be a year of chaos, fear and a deficit of hope, but I will spend every breath I have telling you what I believe and telling you that I care, and you are not alone. For years, I’ve watched the destruction of the services and the mechanisms that were responsible for allowing me to have a normal life, to thrive, to be able to speak with a voice that was truly mine. I’ve watched them burn, or worse, turned into abominable growth vehicles for men disconnected from society and humanity. I owe my life to an internet I've watched turned into multiple abuse factories worth multiple trillions of dollars and the people responsible get gladhandled and applauded. I will scream at them until my dying fucking breath. I have had a blessed life, and I am lucky that I wasn't born even a year earlier or later, but the way I have grown up and seen things change has allowed me to fully comprehend how much damage is being done today, and how much worse is to come if we don't hold these people accountable. The least they deserve is a spoken or written record of their sins, and the least you deserve is to be reminded that you are the victim. I don't think you realise how powerful it is being armed with knowledge — the clarity of what's being done to and why, and the names of the people responsible. This is an invisible war — and a series of invisible war crimes — perpetuated against billions of people in a trillion different ways every minute of every day, and it's everywhere, a constant in our lives, which makes enumerating and conceptualising it difficult. But you can help. You talking about the truth behind generative AI, or the harms of Facebook, or the gratuitous destruction of Google Search will change things, because these people are unprepared for a public that knows both what they’ve done and their sickening, loathsome, selfish and greedy intentions. I realize this isn’t particularly satisfying to some, because you want big ideas, big changes that can be made. I don’t know what to tell you. I don’t know how to fix things. To quote Howard Beale in the movie Network, I don’t want you to write your Congressman because I don’t know what to tell you to write. But what I can tell you is that you can live your life with a greater understanding of the incentives of those who control the internet and have made your digital lives worse as a means of making themselves rich. I can tell you to live with more empathy, understanding and clarity into the reasons that people around you might be angry at their circumstances, as even those unrelated to technology are made worse by exploitative, abusive and pernicious digital manipulation. This is a moment of solidarity, as we are all harmed by the Rot Economy. We are all victims. It takes true opulence to escape it, and I'm guessing you don't have it. I certainly don't. But talking about it — refusing to go quietly, refusing to slurp down the slop willingly or pleasantly — is enough. The conversations are getting louder. The anger is getting too hard to ignore. These companies will be forced to change through public pressure and the knowledge of their deeds. Holding these people to a higher standard at scale is what brings about change. Be the wrench in the machine. Be the person that explains to a friend why Facebook sucks now, and who chose to make it suck. Be the person to explain who Prabhakar Raghavan is and what his role was in making Google Search worse. Be the person who tells people that Sam Altman burns $5 billion a year on unsustainable software that destroys the environment and is built upon the large-scale larceny of creative works because he's desperate for power. Every time you do this, you destabilise them. They have succeeded in a decades-long marketing campaign where they get called geniuses for making the things that are necessary to function in society worse. You can change that. I don't even care if you cite me. Just tell them. Tell everybody. Spread the word. Say what they've done and say their names, say their names again and again and again so that it becomes a contagion. They have twisted and broken and hyper-monetised everything — how you make friends, fall in love, how you bank, how you listen to music, how you find information. Never let their names be spoken without disgust. Be the sandpaper in their veins and the graffiti on their legacies. The forces I criticize see no beauty in human beings. They do not see us as remarkable things that generate ideas both stupid and incredible, they do not see talent or creativity as something that is innately human, but a commodity to be condensed and monetized and replicated so that they ultimately own whatever value we have, which is the kind of thing you’d only believe was possible (or want) if you were fully removed from the human race. You deserve better than they’ve given you. You deserve better than I’ve given you, which is why I’m going to work even harder in 2025. Thank you, as ever, for your time. Subscribe today. It's free.

Title: Bitcoin Hits Record High Against Gold: What It Means For BTC Price?
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-hits-record-high-against-gold-what-it-means-for-btc-price/
Time Published: 2024-12-17T05:30:37Z
Full Content:
Amid its historic price action, Bitcoin (BTC) has quietly hit a new all-time high (ATH) against gold. The insight was highlighted by veteran trader Peter Brandt in an X post. Brandt’s analysis revealed that the BTC-to-gold ratio has reached a new ATH of 32.19 ounces of gold per BTC. In his post, the seasoned trader also took a subtle dig at long-time gold advocate Peter Schiff, a vocal Bitcoin critic. For those unfamiliar, the BTC-to-gold ratio measures Bitcoin’s performance relative to gold, showing how many ounces of gold are needed to purchase one whole BTC. This metric underscores Bitcoin’s growing dominance as a store of value. Brandt further noted that the next target for Bitcoin is 89 ounces of gold per BTC, suggesting significant room for Bitcoin to grow against the precious metal. This aligns with the broader narrative within the crypto industry that Bitcoin is poised to challenge gold’s $15 trillion market cap. It’s worth recalling that Brandt previously predicted Bitcoin would rise 400% relative to gold by 2025. Back in October, he projected that BTC could reach the equivalent of 123 ounces of gold based on historical market patterns. A recent report by trading firm Bernstein added weight to this narrative, forecasting that Bitcoin is on track to replace gold as the preferred safe-haven asset within the next 10 years. As of now, BTC boasts a market cap of $2.11 trillion, steadily closing in on gold’s dominance. Similar forecast was made by one of the earliest Bitcoin advocates, Eric Voorhees. The CEO of ShapeShift crypto exchange made a bold prediction, saying that unlike gold or oil, BTC’s digitally-programmed supply scarcity will drive its price upwards. Additionally, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, predicts that Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could surpass gold ETFs in total assets under management within the next two years. Supporting this outlook, data from SoSoValue indicates that cumulative net inflows into all spot BTC ETFs currently stand at $35.6 billion, compared to gold ETFs, which sit at $55 billion. With BTC surpassing the pivotal $100,000 price level, speculation has grown regarding President-elect Donald Trump’s approach to digital assets. Industry experts believe that Trump may prioritize Bitcoin adoption early in his second term, further boosting BTC’s price. Data supports this optimistic view. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the number of BTC whales – wallet addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC – has skyrocketed since Trump’s election victory. This optimism is further fuelled by speculation surrounding a potential US strategic Bitcoin reserve. Prominent financiers argue that if the US were to create such a reserve, China and other nations would likely follow suit to remain competitive. At press time, BTC trades at $106,909, up 3.7% in the past 24 hours.

Title: Does BlackRock own 30% of farmland in Ukraine?! | Tech ARP

Does BlackRock now own 30% of farmland in Ukraine?! Take a look at the viral claim, and find out what the facts really are! Some people are claiming or suggesting that BlackRock now owns 30% of farmland in Ukraine! Wide Awake Media / 1minuterantzz (deleted) : [Ukraine] was one of the biggest agricultural and farming producers globally… Now, 30% of its farmland has been sold off.” “And that has been sold off to three companies… The major shareholder and owner of those three companies… is BlackRock.” “So BlackRock effectively now owns 30% of the farmland in Ukraine.” “Meanwhile, by complete coincidence, laws and new taxes have been brought in in the UK, which… are going to lead to pockets of our farmland having to be sold off… The only way [farmers] can pay those taxes is to sell off… their land.” “Who are they going to sell it to? Big corporations.” “I wonder, could that possibly be BlackRock? Or could it possibly be the now biggest private land owner in the whole of the USA, Bill Gates?” Recommended : Did NATO announce plan for sneak attack on Russia?! This is yet another example of fake news circulating on TikTok and X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, and here are the reasons why… BlackRock does not own 30% of farmland in Ukraine BlackRock is a public-listed company, and that means its assets and accounts are not only audited and publicly disclosed, they must also publicly announce material information, which would include buying up large swathes of farmland in any country. If BlackRock does indeed own 30% of farmland in Ukraine, it would be a matter of public record, and would likely have sparked some outrage in Ukraine. Yet, there are no records of BlackRock purchasing or owning 30% of farmland in Ukraine. Unsurprisingly, people making these claims have never provided any evidence BlackRock purchased or owns 30% of farmland in Ukraine. Ukraine forbids foreign ownership of farmland It would be impossible for BlackRock, or any foreign company, to purchase farmland in Ukraine, as Ukrainian law forbids foreign ownership of farmland! As The Sofia Globe explained: Ukraine’s Land Act states in its article 1 that “land is the prime national asset and is under the special protection of the state.” According to the law agricultural land in the country can be owned only by Ukrainian citizens, companies whose ownership is wholly in the hands of Ukrainian citizens, as well as by local councils and the state. Article 130 prohibits foreign citizens, stateless persons or legal entities from acquiring shares in companies or being members on organisations that own agricultural land. The law says also that those restrictions on land ownership can only be removed through a referendum. Between 1992 and 2021 a moratorium on the trade in agricultural land was in place in Ukraine. It did not allow any land sales, even between Ukrainian citizens. Recommended : Is Biden Admin planning to transfer nuclear weapons to Ukraine?! Even after the moratorium on the sale of agricultural land was lifted in 2021, only Ukrainian citizens and companies could buy or sell farmland. This was confirmed by the US State Department’s 2021 investment climate report on Ukraine: Foreign and domestic private entities can engage in all forms of remunerative activity, with some exceptions: foreign companies are restricted from owning agricultural land, producing bioethanol, and some publishing activities. It is therefore impossible for BlackRock, or any foreign entity, to own 30% of all farmland in Ukraine. Ukraine would have to change its law before any foreigner, or foreign company, can buy agricultural land in Ukraine. Even China could only lease Ukrainian land Even China could only lease 3 million hectares (7.4 million acres) of Ukrainian agriculture land in 2013, for about $2.6 billion per year. And it did so by leasing land owned by Ukrainian government-controlled agricultural company KSG Agro. The farmland would be used mainly to grow crops and raise pigs for the Chinese market. I should point out that massive lease involved less than 10% of farmland in Ukraine. It would be impossible for any country or entity to lease 20% to 30% of farmland in Ukraine without public disclosure. Needless to say – there are no reports of BlackRock leasing large swathes of Ukrainian farmland either! Ukraine invited BlackRock to invest in post-war reconstruction In May 2023, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with BlackRock’s leadership. The Ukrainian government invited the asset management company to participate in an investment fund for the future reconstruction of Ukraine. The investment fund not only involves other multinational companies like JP Morgan, and McKinsey, it does not involve foreign ownership of Ukrainian farmland. In addition, this fund is to meant to rebuild Ukraine after the war with Russia ends. In short – even if BlackRock participates in this Ukraine reconstruction fund, it won’t give the company ownership of 30% of farmland in Ukraine.

The US central bank is widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of the meeting on Wednesday, bringing rates down by a total 100 bps in 2024. But the central bank’s outlook on rates will be closely watched, especially in light of recent data showing inflation grew stickier in November, while the labor market remained strong. CME fed-watchtool shows more than 95% chance for a 25bps cut by Fed in this week’s meeting. On the geo-political front, Israel agreed on Sunday to double its population in the Golan Heights, citing Syrian threats despite the moderate tone of rebel leaders who ousted President Bashar al-Assad a week ago. On data front, retail sales from China was reported lower than estimates. NY empiring state manufacturing index and US manufacturing PMI was reported lower than estimates while the US services PMI was strong. Focus today will be on US retail sales and Industrial production, lower than expected data could support bullions from lower end. The Nifty retraced a portion of the Friday short squeeze, creating a “bearish harami” formation. That means the next tactical move will be decided by which of yesterday’s high or low gets broken first. For the day, resistance rests between 24726 and 24800, while supports lie in the 24554 - 24580 range. What’s also interesting is that the Friday low took support at the Bollinger-middle line, which means buyers remain active on any decline inside what will soon be a period of reduced volumes and therefore higher volatility.

Title: SoftBank’s $100 Billion Promise To Trump Is More Than Its Entire Market Cap
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2024/12/16/softbank-trump-masayoshi-son-100-billion/
Time Published: 2024-12-17T00:35:35Z
Full Content:
The Japanese tech conglomerate has assets, like a majority stake in British chip company Arm, but hasn’t detailed how it will pony up. SoftBank announced a $100 billion commitment to U.S. projects over the span of Trump's presidency. On Monday, SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son and President-elect Donald Trump jointly announced a bold commitment: The Japanese tech conglomerate aims to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years. It was a glitzy pledge from a global tech leader, teaming up with the incoming president with a promise to create at least 100,000 new American jobs in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. The announcement eclipses a similar one Son made in 2016 as Trump first took office — a $50 billion pledge and 50,000 jobs. “President Trump is a double down president,” Son said during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private residence in Palm Beach, Florida. “I’m going to have to double down.” There’s just one hitch: SoftBank doesn’t actually have $100 billion at the moment. As of market close on Monday, its entire market cap was $97 billion, and it has $29 billion in cash on hand. It’s unclear how the company would finance its pledge and Son didn’t bother to detail how during its announcement. The commitment is over the span of Trump’s presidency, so SoftBank will have years to make good on its promise. The company did fulfill its 2016 vow of $50 billion, with investments in dozens of companies including Slack and DoorDash. It’s more difficult to determine if it created that number of jobs, and the company did not provide an estimate at the end of Trump’s last term. SoftBank didn’t respond to a request for comment. The company’s most valuable asset is a majority stake in Arm Holdings, the British semiconductor company that went public last year. Arm’s market cap is currently $152.6 billion, with SoftBank’s roughly 90% stake valued at $137.3 billion. If liquidated, it would easily cover the company’s commitment. It’s unlikely, of course, that SoftBank would sell off its entire stake. Offloading large amounts of stock would probably cause the share price to crater. It could use its Arm stock as leverage to take out debt that would finance this commitment; but SoftBank has already taken out $8 billion in margin loans against its Arm stock. In reaching into the Arm piggy bank, SoftBank doesn’t want to repeat missteps it took with Alibaba. In 2000, SoftBank invested $20 million in the Chinese ecommerce company, which went public in 2014 in the largest tech IPO ever, raising $25 billion. SoftBank reportedly owned 24% of the company at the time — a stake that dwindled to 7% in 2022, and down to half a percent by last May. SoftBank’s announcement comes as several tech executives have tried to curry favor with Trump as he returns to power. In the last few days, Facebook parent Meta, Amazon and OpenAI have reportedly promised to donate $1 million each to Trump’s inauguration fund. With key supporters like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Silicon Valley has struck a different tone from when Trump first took office four years ago. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg recently made a visit to Mar-a-Lago, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly has a visit in the works. SoftBank is best known for its Vision Fund, a $100 billion venture fund it announced in 2017 for investing in tech companies worldwide, with half the funds raised from the sovereign wealth funds of Middle East countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But the Vision Fund came to be known for misplaced bets, including the ill-fated coworking real estate company WeWork, and Softbank posted an $18 billion loss. In 2020, the activist investor Elliott Management bought a $2.5 billion stake in the Vision Fund and pushed for restructuring and more transparency. By the time Softbank set out to raise more money for a Vision Fund 2, the company had trouble courting investors because of the first fund’s issues. In trying to hit the $100 billion mark, the company could potentially count already-announced commitments to its tally. For example, Softbank reportedly invested another $1.5 billion in OpenAI last month through an employee tender offer. In May, the Japanese company said it would commit $9 billion a year to AI investments, though it didn’t specify where it would make its bets. Trump, who described Son as “one of the most accomplished business leaders of our time,” didn’t seem worried about where the money would come from, and even pushed for more. “I’ve looked at their books and they do have the possibility of doing more,” Trump said Monday. “I’m going to ask them to do a little bit more.” He then challenged Son to double his promise again to $200 billion. While remaining noncommittal, Son laughed and said he would “try to make it happen.” “He’s a great negotiator,” he said. Additional reporting by Iain Martin.

Title: Deep State Officials Opposing Tulsi Gabbard’s Nomination Have Deep Ties To Defense Contractors, Censorship

Full Content:
Numerous officials that signed a letter opposing Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination for Director of National Intelligence (DNI) are tied to groups targeting “election misinformation,” left-wing organizations, intelligence agencies and defense contractors. Certain members of Foreign Policy for America, the group behind the letter, are linked to entities from Lockheed Martin to George Soros’s Open Society Foundations. Nearly 100 national security officials published a letter calling for a “thorough vetting” of Gabbard, and it was addressed to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and soon-to-be Majority Leader John Thune. Former Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman criticized Gabbard’s views on the Russia-Ukraine war, former head of U.S. counterintelligence Joel Brenner blasted the nomination as “an insult to our intelligence agencies,” and former Senior CIA officer Melvin Gamble said her nomination “should worry any American who cares about keeping our country safe.” But these very same people are part of the cohort of intelligence officials President-elect Donald Trump has signaled he wants to remove from power. FP4A & nearly 100 national security leaders call on the Senate to thoroughly vet Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination for Director of National Intelligence. Her qualifications & past statements raise serious concerns about her ability to serve in this critical role. Full letter here ⬇️ — Foreign Policy for America (@FP4America) December 4, 2024 “This is a perfect example of why President Trump chose Tulsi Gabbard for this position,” Gabbard’s transition spokeswoman Alexa Henning told the Daily Caller. (RELATED: ‘National Security’ Officials Who Endorsed Harris Tied To Intel Agencies, Defense Contractors) “These unfounded attacks are from the same geniuses who have blood on their hands from decades of faulty ‘intelligence,’ including the non-existent weapons of mass destruction. These intel officials continue to use classification as a partisan weapon to smear and imply things about their political enemy without putting the facts out.” U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to be Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard (R) walks with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) to the Russell Senate Office Building on December 09, 2024 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Much of the group’s criticism levied at Gabbard centered around her 2017 meeting with then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Much of that criticism has been absent for Democratic California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who also met with Assad in 2007. Sherman, for her part, previously criticized Trump for attempting to remove U.S. troops from Syria in 2018. Asaad fled the country and escaped to Russia after the oppositional coalition Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) overthrew his regime last week. HTS is considered a terrorist organization by many of the world’s governments, including the United States. The group’s leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, was previously a leader of an al-Qaeda affiliate in the country. The Daily Caller is working to be your voice in the swamp. Support the mission by clicking here to subscribe today. Before she criticized Gabbard for speaking with a foreign dictator, Sherman negotiated with terrorists on behalf of the Obama administration. She was his Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs and played a key role in negotiating the Iran nuclear deal. The Obama administration unfroze nearly $2 billion in assets for the Iranian regime in 2016. Rose Gottemoeller, Joel Brenner, and Brian P. McKeon all served in the Obama administration and slammed Gabbard’s nomination. President Obama launched a CIA program in 2013 aimed at removing Assad, but it was ultimately a failure, and Trump ended the program in 2017. Gabbard called Assad a “brutal dictator” in an interview with CNN in 2019, and has defended the meeting as a means of preventing America from being involved in foreign entanglements. “He’s a brutal dictator. Just like Saddam Hussein. Just like Gaddafi in Libya,” Gabbard told CNN. Far from hurting Tulsi Gabbard’s confirmation chances, this week’s events prove out her contention a decade ago that Al Qaeda would be the chief beneficiary of regime change in Syria. The leader of HTS is a designated terrorist and former leader of Al Nusra. — Michael Brendan Dougherty (@michaelbd) December 8, 2024 Some of the officials opposing Gabbard’s nomination are affiliated with organizations focused on combating “disinformation” in elections. Sherman currently serves as a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center. Former Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, John Tien, also signed the letter and is a senior fellow at the Belfer Center. The Belfer Center was involved in the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency’s (CISA) training seminars on election “disinformation,” according to a CISA “Disinformation in 2020” YouTube video. The CISA relied on the Center’s “Defending Digital Democracy Project” (D3P), which is led by former Army intelligence officer Eric Rosenbach, and Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney’s former campaign managers. The Belfer Center also partnered with The National Democratic Institute (NDI) and The International Republican Institute (IRI) to tackle “misinformation in elections,” both of which are funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to USA Spending. 6.

Additionally, the Executive Director of Foreign Policy for America, Andrew Albertson, worked in the USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI). Multiple Foreign Policy for America members are also tied to Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, which recently held a discussion with never-Trump neoconservative Bill Kristol. In September 2024, it had an event on “free and fair elections” about “threats of foreign interference, disinformation, [and] political violence.” Former Chief of Staff of the Commission Security and Cooperation in Europe, Alex T. Johnson, signed the letter and was senior policy advisor for Europe and Eurasia at George Soros’s Open Society Foundations until February 2019. Aside from ties to left-wing organizations combating “disinformation,” some of the members are linked to defense contractors or groups funded by them.

Ambassadors Anthony Stephen Harrington and Kenneth S. Yalowitz are both fellows and signed the letter opposing Gabbard’s nomination. John D. Butler, another official listed on the letter, was previously on the board of Lockheed Martin. Rose Gottemoeller, who stated Gabbard has “serious red flags,” is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for National Peace’s nuclear program. Carnegie received funding from Boeing and Soros’s Open Society Foundations, according to its 2023 report. Former Ambassador Kenneth S. Yalowitz and former Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Annie Pforzheimer, who signed the letter, are both members of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). The CFR is funded by Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman in addition to Blackrock, various banks, and tech giants like Google, according its list of corporate members. Well, if national security experts oppose @TulsiGabbard… Say no more! I’m voting to confirm @TulsiGabbard https://t.co/iZIxqnHHvi — Mike Lee (@BasedMikeLee) December 6, 2024 Another official, former Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Brian P. McKeon, is Senior Director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. Classified documents from then-Vice President Joe Biden were discovered at the Penn Biden Center office in 2022. (RELATED: GOP Senators Who Could Block Tulsi Gabbard’s Confirmation Took Huge Checks From Defense Industry) Last Monday, however, hundreds of veterans endorsed Gabbard’s nomination and lauded her military service. “As a Member of Congress and as a civilian, Tulsi has been a stalwart advocate for veterans’ health concerning toxic exposures and cancer care as a result of our fellow veterans’ military service. Tulsi’s life exemplifies a rare blend of selflessness, courage, and leadership—qualities desperately needed to reform and strengthen our intelligence community,” their letter reads.

Another day, another rally by mega tech stocks. Shares of iPhone maker Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, electric car maker Tesla and AI-chipmaker Broadcom all rallied to new all-time highs, which helped power the tech-heavy Nasdaq to its own record peak. The Nasdaq closed up 1.24%, or 247.17 points, at a record 20,173.89. The broad S&P 500 index ended up 0.38%, or 22.99 points, at 6,074.08 and the blue-chip Dow slipped for an eight consecutive session for its longest streak of declines since 2018. It closed down 0.25%, or 110.58 points, at 43,717.48. All eyes are on the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which ends on Wednesday afternoon. Although the Fed's expected to trim its short-term, benchmark fed funds rate again by a quarter percentage point, many economists expect the central bank to signal a slower pace of rate cuts next year and revise its economic outlook. "This could be the last cut for a while," said Jacob Channel, senior economist at comparison site LendingTree. "Because the upcoming Trump Administration’s policies might cause a resurgence in inflation or otherwise throw the economy off balance, the Fed might choose to take a wait-and-see approach and hold rates steady at their January meeting." Capitalize on high interest rates: Best current CD rates The day's winners included: Broadcom (AVGO): The chip software company extended its rally off its better-than-expected earnings report late Thursday and strong outlook. Shares are now up more than 120% for the year. Bitcoin: The cryptocurrency surged to an all-time high above $107,000 after MicroStrategy said it bought an additional 15,350 bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 439,000, worth about $46 billion. Companies with the largest declines included: Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The AI server company said its auditor resigned this fall and its shares will be axed from the Nasdaq-100. Nvidia (NVDA): The AI chip company's shares slipped, putting it officially into correction territory, traders said. Shares are down more than 10% from its closing high of $148.88 reached last month. Analysts said money's moving into other AI-related companies after Nvidia's 166% run up this year. Oil fell 1% to $70.58 per barrel after China reported soft retail sales data. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 4.397% ahead of an expected Fed rate cut. Medora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Similarly, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) upgraded Axon's stock from Equalweight to Overweight, reflecting confidence in the sustainability of the company's growth rate.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 Tech Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other tech stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. Like all of us, Jim Cramer is always wondering what's next for the stock market. So far, the year has seen AI continue to dominate the market, accompanied by the Federal Reserve and the 2024 US Presidential Election. Now, with the election over and investors pondering over the incoming administration's tariff policies, like us, Cramer is also focused on the Federal Reserve. The reason why the Fed and tariffs are related is because the latter can cause inflation to force the former to keep interest rates higher for longer. While it tries to decipher what's ahead for AI, Wall Street is also wondering about the pace, magnitude, and frequency of the Federal Reserve's 2025 interest rate cut cycle. This nervousness is reflected in bond yields touching 4.38% on Friday, and asset manager Apollo Global warning that four key inflation indicators appear to be reaccelerating. As per Apollo, the Core CPI, the Core PCE, the Supercore CPI, and the Supercore CPE have all started to rise again. In Mad Money aired last week, Cramer also had the Fed in mind. Cramer, in his show, commented on the nervousness in the market. The television show host wondered why the stock market wasn't responding to semiconductor stocks doing well. He started out by sharing that "I hate the endless focus on the Fed. By everybody. Because it detracts you from benefiting from long-term performance for your stock portfolio." This is because Cramer believes that "every little signal from the Federal Reserve brings out predictions, causing many people to sell good stocks when they are freaked out." He did add that the economic data shows that there will be dissent at the Federal Reserve when it comes to further reducing interest rates at the upcoming December meeting. Cramer shared that "while I don't think the data is cool enough to be positive about the prospects of more cuts for now, I also don't want you to make decisions purely on what the Fed does. Contrary to popular belief, there's more to investing than monetary policy. And I wish everyone knew that. They don't." On the topic of tariffs, Cramer had plenty to share in November. He started out by analyzing the performance of the benchmark S&P index between mid-2017 and the start of 2020. Cramer pointed out that "this is where we start to get the real tariff action from the first Trump administration." He shared that "Trump imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum, solar panels, and washing machines among other goods." While "all these helped the industries in question . . .the broader market didn't like that we were triggering a global trade war." Cramer pointed out the index's performance between January 22nd and December 24th, 2018 to bolster the view that tariffs weren't great for the stock market. However, before you write them off, consider his remarks. According to Cramer, during this time period, "the S&P 500 lost 18% of its value. Of course, some of that is because the Fed got much more aggressive about raising interest rates through this period. Taking them up. a 100 basis points that year. But it definitely wasn't just the Fed. You can see from the chart that virtually every time we got more tariffs, the S&P would roll over, every time China retaliated, we'd sell off." Yet, according to Cramer, "once the Fed decided to stop tightening at the very end of 2018, the S&P was finally able to find a floor." Following this, the market "rebounded like crazy" as part of a "bullish trading cycle, one that continued until Covid hit in 2020. Long story short, the market couldn't handle the trade war when the Fed was tightening. But as soon as the Fed started easing, all those losses evaporated." Using charts from Jessica Inskip, Cramer compared the last intersection of the Fed and Trump tariffs with today's environment. He outlined that the "Fed is now our friend." Why is that so? Well, according to Cramer, as soon as the Fed stopped tightening, the market "stopped reacting as aggressively to the trade war." He shared that Inskip believes that "something like a trade war can certainly hurt us badly when the market's already trending bearishly. But if we've got a bullish trading cycle like we do right now, then she's not worried as long as we can maintain this cycle." So, as Cramer remains cautiously optimistic about the stock market's future, we decided to see how his views about stocks have stood the test of time. Our Methodology To make our list of the 15 stocks Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about, we compiled his statements about top tech stocks and ranked them by the date the statements were made. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 104 Date of Cramer's Comments: 10-04-24 Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s CEO Dr. Lisa Su was nominated as Time Magazine's CEO of the year in December. In October, Cramer was also full of praise for the executive who has capitalized on Intel's troubles to carve out a place for it in the data center industry and grow PC market share. According to him: “Not to be outdone, Lisa Su, the CEO of AMD, will hold an analyst day and it’s entitled Advancing AI 2024. It starts at noon. Today, when the stock was plummeting, I told investing club members at my 10:20 morning meeting that Su’s presentation could show this charitable trust holding in a whole new light, even as they’ve been raising their AI sales forecast quarter after quarter after quarter. I think it’s a buy ahead of the meeting, although the stock did run eight points after we talked about it at the morning meeting.” Since his remarks, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s shares have lost a whopping 22%. The bearishness is built on the firm's third-quarter earnings and a BofA downgrade. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s stature as a growth stock meant that when it guided $7.5 billion in revenue for the current quarter, which was in-line with analyst estimates, investors were spooked that it would be unable to capitalize on AI growth. Then, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s shares fell by 5.6% after BofA downgraded it to Neutral from Buy and slashed the price target to $155 from $180 as it grew wary of a growth in PC sales in 2025. Overall AMD ranks 13th on our list of the tech stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

AMD (AMD), a Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker that has benefited generously from the A.I. boom, is pouring some of its newfound cash into generative A.I. startups. AMD’s newest A.I. bet is on Liquid AI, a startup established last year by MIT researchers that aims to create cost-effective A.I. models. The chipmaker’s investment arm led the startup’s recent $250 million funding round, which included investors like OSS Capital and Duke Capital Partners and reportedly values the startup at more than $2 billion.

By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Unlike the traditional neural networks underpinning A.I. systems, which model the human brain, Liquid AI is focused on a new type of A.I. model that takes inspiration from the smaller brains of worms and requires significantly less compute and energy. “Liquid AI’s unique approach to developing efficient AI models will push the boundaries of A.I., making it far more accessible,” said Mathew Hein, chief strategy officer of corporate development at AMD, in a statement. The Liquid AI investment marks the ninth A.I. bet placed by AMD Ventures in 2024 alone, according to data from Crunchbase. And it isn’t just the chipmaker’s venture division that has been ramping up its work with startups. Of the 12 investments by AMD since 2000, half were made in the past four years. “We’ve decided to become much more active in how we’re working on this,” said Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, during a recent podcast interview. In light of A.I.’s rapid advancement, even large enterprises that were previously “more conservative with working with startups are also becoming much more open,” added Su. “Nobody wants to be behind in A.I.” Earlier this month, AMD Ventures participated in a $155 million funding round for Ayar Labs, a startup developing A.I. chips that transmit data to each other with light. Other investments made in 2024 benefited the likes of Cohere, a Canadian startup specializing in A.I. models for enterprises, and the data-labeling Scale AI. In September, AMD became one of the backers behind World Labs, a venture established by acclaimed A.I. academic Fei-Fei Li that aims to create A.I. models able to navigate and reason with the 3D world. AMD company-wide investments, meanwhile, have focused on A.I.-centered companies like the GPU cloud platform TensorWave and the model provider Fireworks AI. Last year, the chipmaker backed Hugging Face, an open-source A.I. developer platform, in a $235 million round that valued the company at $4.5 billion. AMD isn’t the only chipmaker moonlighting as a major A.I. investor. Nvidia (NVDA), too, has demonstrated a growing appetite for venture capital in recent years; having also partaken in fundraising rounds for Hugging Face, Cohere and Scale AI. The value of its A.I. bets reportedly totaled $1.5 billion at the beginning of 2024—a sharp jump from just $300 million the year prior.

Title: Bitcoin buyer MicroStrategy ends flat after getting Nasdaq 100 nod

Business FILE PHOTO: Representation of the bitcoin cryptocurrency and a price chart are seen in this illustration taken October 24, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo :MicroStrategy shares briefly surged on Monday before faltering to end nearly unchanged, after the software company and bitcoin stockpiler was selected to join the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index, further brightening the prospects of the stock. The $25.7 trillion index that houses the largest non-financial companies will now gain indirect exposure to bitcoin via MicroStrategy, which holds $44 billion worth of the digital currency on its balance sheet, about 2 per cent of the total supply of the world's largest cryptocurrency. The prospect of more buying from funds that track the Nasdaq 100 could further boost MicroStrategy's stock that has surged nearly 550 per cent this year alongside a jump in the bitcoin price. Its share price rose as much as 7 per cent on Monday before running out of steam to close 0.042 per cent lower It could be "the start of a looping cycle of capital that could potentially drive up the spot BTC price," said Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency asset manager Astronaut Capital. "ETFs such as QQQ and many others would buy MicroStrategy to mirror holdings of the index, therefore driving up the price, and in turn, allowing MicroStrategy to purchase more BTC through debt, bond and equity offerings." The fifth largest U.S. exchange-traded fund Invesco QQQ Trust tracks the Nasdaq 100 and has $328 billion in assets under management, according to data analytics company VettaFi. Bitcoin surged to a record high above $107,000 on Monday after President-elect Donald Trump suggested he plans to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its strategic oil reserve. MicroStrategy's shares have gained 3,200 per cent since adopting bitcoin as its treasury asset in 2020 under the leadership of co-founder Michael Saylor. The company has more than doubled its bitcoin holdings this year through convertible note offerings and share sales. It reported a net loss of $340 million in the three months ended Sept. 20, its third consecutive quarterly loss. "MicroStrategy's bitcoin strategy is a long-term, high-conviction 'buy and hold' strategy," said Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. The company's market capitalization rose to over $100 billion as its share price climbed, more than twice the value of its bitcoin stockpile. At the close it was valued at almost $98 billion. Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms and some small biotech firms including Enlivex Therapeutics and Hoth Therapeutics have also decided to allocate portions of their cash to bitcoin. "Longer term, this is a huge milestone for crypto and we are bound to hear the voices, both bulls and bears, get a lot louder talking about MicroStrategy and Saylor in the months to come," Dibb said. Short sellers, or investors betting against MicroStrategy's shares, have lost a total of $9.7 billion since the beginning of the year. Other entrants to the Nasdaq 100 include Palantir and Axon Enterprise, Nasdaq said late on Friday, replacing Illumina, Super Micro and Moderna. The reconstituted index will begin trading on Dec. 23.

Venture capital in the U.S. has moved to artificial intelligence (AI) companies at an “unprecedented” rate, HSBC Innovation Banking said Monday (Dec. 16). The scale of capital invested in AI companies by U.S. venture investors is approaching that allocated to the rest of the venture market, the firm said in a Monday press release outlining findings from Innovation Horizons, its latest quarterly outlook for the U.S. technology sector. Forty-two percent of U.S. venture capital was invested into AI companies in 2024, up from 36% in 2023 and 22% in 2022, according to the report. The report also found that as of 2024, 20 AI companies have each raised $2 billion or more. “Venture capital has always gravitated toward transformative industries, but the level of consolidation we’re seeing within one category is unprecedented,” HSBC U.S. Innovation Banking Head Dave Sabow said in the release. “The radical change this investment will fuel places us in the dawn of ‘The Agentic Age,’ an era where autonomous artificial intelligence capabilities fundamentally redefine how we communicate, work and interface with digital and physical worlds.” Investment giant BlackRock said Dec. 7 that it expects 2025 to be a big year for infrastructure and cybersecurity, with the AI boom playing a major role in those investments. “It’s still very early in the AI adoption cycle,” Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, told CNBC in a Dec. 7 report. Jacobs added that AI firms need to build out their data centers and that protecting that data will likely be a wise investment. The HSBC report came on the same day that SoftBank said it will invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, focusing on AI and related infrastructure. HSBC Innovation Banking also found in its report that R&D spending from the so-called Magnificent 7 companies totaled more than all the dollars invested in U.S. startups in 2024, according to the release. The Magnificent 7 are Tesla, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet. The firm also said in the release that it expects the U.S. tech sector to see new waves of growth and tailwinds for returns resulting from expected changes in the acquisition market, deregulation and fiscal policies that stimulate economic activity. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Vera Wang, WHP Global Discuss New Chapter for the 35-year-old Lifestyle Brand

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Vera Wang and WHP Global's Yehuda Shmidman talk about new opportunities in global markets and sectors like hospitality. News Director “It’s exciting. Who would have thunk it?” said Vera Wang Monday morning after a deal for WHP Global to acquire her 35-year-old luxury lifestyle brand was revealed. In a telephone interview with Wang and Yehuda Shmidman, chairman and chief executive officer of WHP Global, the two spoke animatedly about plans for the future, and where they see the business headed. Hospitality was high on Wang’s list of growth opportunities. Wang said she wasn’t necessarily actively looking for an investor, but “probably I’ve been searching to expand my brand throughout my whole career and my whole company life.” You May Also Like Related Articles Eye Scoops W Hotels Taps Chloë Sevigny, Miranda Makaroff for New Brand Campaign Business Features Inside Graphic Image and GiGi New York's Unique Manufacturing Facility “I’ve got to be honest: I felt it was the perfect time for Yehuda and for me and for our brand — the synergy and his belief in me. They are in a full growth mode, and I mean it. Frankly, I know that we’ve generated a lot of branding over the past six or seven years, and I think it’s the perfect time for me to execute in ways that I could not have done before. With their enormous support, this gives me an opportunity to grow in a way that I could never have done on my own,” said Wang. Founded in 1990, Wang’s brand today generates over $700 million in annual retail sales across categories including women’s apparel, bridal, men’s tuxedos and suiting, fine jewelry, fragrance, and home, among others. “In all fairness, you need financing and a level of expertise, and also energy, in the sense of desire and passion. All these things are things that Yehuda has in spades,” said Wang. WHP Global is a global management firm that was cofounded by Shmidman in 2019 with the help of funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, Ares Management, Solus Alternative Assets Management, and BlackRock. Its portfolio of brands runs the gamut from Bonobos, Joe’s Jeans, Rag & Bone and G-Star to Anne Klein, Joseph Abboud, Isaac Mizrahi, Warners, Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us. Shmidman told WWD: “This is the quintessential ‘1 + 1 equals 5.’ What Vera built is one of a kind, what the Vera Wang brand is is one of a kind and Vera Wang is a legend and one of a kind. We’re combining with an infrastructure of over $7 billion in sales, and we’re active in over 50 countries,” he added. Shmidman said he and Wang have been talking about going global in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, to which Wang interjected: “We’ve been global, people don’t really realize that. We’ve been in China for 25 years. We’ll have eight freestanding bridal stores with our partner in China. [There are seven right now]. We have had seven stores in Japan for probably 20 years.” For the past 35 years Wang said her business has been self-financed, although she has had retail partners. In 2006, Wang held acquisition discussions with companies such as Liz Claiborne Inc. and St. John, before striking a lucrative licensing deal with Kohl’s for Simply Vera, Vera Wang in 2007. Wang, a shrewd negotiator, is known for taking her time before striking deals. Asked what attracted him to the Vera Wang brand, Shmidman gave a one-word answer: “Everything.” He said he’s admired and studied the brand for some time. “Vera’s already built the brand in many countries, and there’s still so much more growth potential. When you think of the global industry of fashion and what Vera Wang represents to people and the emotional connection to people, this is all about the future. It’s all about what we can do together,” he said. He said Wang will not only continue as founder and chief creative officer of her brand, but she will be “an important shareholder of WHP Global.” Citing opportunities for the brand, Shmidman said when one thinks about the DNA of Wang’s business, everyone will say bridal. “There are so many aspects of fashion already built, and more to come, and of course, there’s home, but there’s more,” he said. Wang added that she’s been in hard home and soft home for years, with a thriving business in sheets and towels, “not only at Kohl’s but at Macy’s.” She also has a licensing deal with Waterford Wedgwood. “The future of that is still gift registry and bridal registry and the amount of product we continue to create in crystal, plates, bone china, and silver. All these things have been going on forever,” said Wang. Wang revealed that one of the biggest opportunities in their plans is hospitality. “That’s one of the most important categories that I could never tackle. I’ve had piecemeal offers,” she said. Wang said she’s had a branded suite at the Halekulani in Hawaii for over 15 years. And there were times in her life when she almost did a deal in Singapore for a Vera Wang hotel and chapels for weddings. “I’ve had a lot of stuff going on for 35 years, it was never was the right time and situation for me. But my first concern always was my core company and competency. This [deal] enables me to begin to explore other areas that I could never possibility get to,” said Wang. Wang said she’d like to do hotels, some which could be bridal-oriented and some style-oriented. She likes to be local and bring a modern style sensibility to whatever country she’s in while respecting their heritage. “I’ve had so much experience in Italy and France, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taiwan, Bangkok…. I just feel there’s a lot to offer there. Of course, bridal is a bit of a tease, but I think it’s a very important part of hospitality. I don’t know a hotel opening right now that doesn’t want to attract a huge event. There are very few that are bigger than bridal,” she said. Asked if she’d like to sign a license for high-end ready-to-wear, Wang was game. “That could happen, right, Yehuda? That will happen,” said Wang. Shmidman added, “The reality is the opportunities are almost endless in the best of ways. What begins in bridal extends to all fashion, expands to all home, lifestyle, and now you’re the first person to hear about the vision into hospitality.” Asked if the Vera Wang staff will remain intact, Shmidman said that they’ve signed the deal but haven’t closed yet. All the details and particulars will be forthcoming post-closing, which is expected in the new year. When he was specifically asked about his modus operandi when he takes over a company, such as Rag & Bone, and whether the infrastructure remains intact, Shmidman said it does. “Everything is about growth; what is amazing that it’s already built and how do we expand and grow?” He said WHP in the past six years has gone from zero to over $7 billion. “With Vera and other initiatives I wouldn’t be surprised if we surpass $8 billion next year.” The company has five offices around the world. Wang believes she has created a company that’s unique for a fashion company. “It’s emotional. We are an emotional company. We dress women on the most important days of their lives for their public — their friends, their family, their relatives. I don’t mean that giving birth to your first child isn’t emotional, I’m saying for your most public moment. When you think of the amount of weddings I have done at all price points, over 35 years, I can honestly say as an ex-skater, that I win the Olympic gold medal for the amount of weddings I attended, the amount of brides I have dressed. We’re truly based on a sense of romance and a sense of commitment and optimism. The most optimistic thing you do is to get married,” said Wang. Wang said she’ll continue to pursue deals at both the high-end and for stores such as Kohl’s and Zales. She just signed new initiatives with Jared and Zales, and has new fragrances in the works with Coty. “This is an opportunity for me to flex what’s it’s taken for me to build a company. I had no investors, and I did this self-funded, and I had no partners until now. And you know better than I how difficult it is,” said Wang. She said this is her 55th year in fashion, she just had her 75th birthday, and this is her 35th year in business. “These three milestones were this year,” said Wang, who had to leave the call because she had to take a call with the White House. Asked what that was about, she said, “I have no idea. It’s anybody’s guess.” Consultants think the acquisition makes sense for both parties. Robert Burke, chairman and CEO of Robert Burke Associates, said, “They [WHP] are really trying to go after a premium brand portfolio like Rag & Bone, G-Star and Joe’s Jeans. What’s unique about Vera’s business is that she’s always been very focused on being a lifestyle brand and a brand that has the potential for licensing. She was very early on with the mattress deal and the Lenox tabletop. She tapped into that bridal market and realized it was multifaceted. If she couldn’t make it, she partnered with someone who could. “She’s still the most internationally recognized label in bridal, hands-down. I think there’s still a great deal of room for her brand to grow,” said Burke. Andrew Jassin, managing director of Jassin Consulting Group, said, “Stuart [Kreisler, director of Jassin Consulting Group] and I have had a long relationship with Vera Wang. We are the ones that created the licenses for fine jewelry, and wine and prosecco, as well as with some other extensions. Though Vera Wang has many successful licensing partnerships, we believe that Vera Wang has been relatively conservative in its licensing. I think it is a brilliant move by WHP; Vera Wang is a truly global brand with incredible consumer connectivity. WHP will extend the Vera Wang bandwidth via their professional licensing and management team. This is a win-win for everyone involved.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Title: Inside Amazon Web Services’ Ambition to Train Two Million A.I. Workers: Q&A
URL: https://observer.com/2024/12/aws-ai-skill-training-interview/
Time Published: 2024-12-16T21:15:01Z

As Big Tech invests billions into the expansion of their cloud infrastructure for A.I., companies are struggling to find workers with the skills needed for cloud computing roles. Amazon (AMZN) Web Services (AWS) seeks to address this talent gap through its AWS Skills Centers, offering a stepping stone for entry-level roles like IT support technicians, systems administrators, developers and engineers with salaries starting at $73,000 a year. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. AWS Skills Centers provide free, in-person training for local community members exploring cloud careers. Introduced in 2021, AWS’s learning hubs offer hands-on classes, workshops, exhibitions, immersive virtual reality experiences and certification programs as part of Amazon’s goal to train over two million people with A.I. skills by 2025. Courses range from introductory classes on generative A.I. to training for cloud practitioner roles, which are gaining traction. As of October, more than 145,000 students have participated in these programs across its three locations in Cape Town in South Africa and Amazon’s U.S. home bases in Seattle, Wash. and Arlington, Va., according to AWS. The global cloud computing market generated $602 billion in revenue in 2023 and is projected to grow 21.2 percent annually through 2030 as companies seek additional compute capacity to run A.I. workloads, according to Grand View Research. IDC forecasts that global annual spending on cloud services will reach $805 billion by the end of 2024 and double by 2028. That’s good news for AWS, which owns half of the global cloud market. Observer spoke with Jenni Troutman, director of AWS Training and Certification Products and Services, about the AWS Skills Centers and how they prepare students for cloud careers in an A.I.-driven world. Before joining AWS in 2017, Troutman held various leadership roles at New Relic, VMware and Accenture. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Observer: What was the impetus behind the AWS Skills Lab? How has the program evolved since its inception? Jenni Troutman: The original idea for the Skills Centers was to establish locations in high-traffic areas where there’s a significant need for cloud skills. That way, people curious about the cloud but unfamiliar with it could drop by, have a coffee, explore opportunities and decide if they’re interested in learning more. From there, they could begin a journey that might extend into other programs at the Skills Center or elsewhere. The first Skills Center opened at our headquarters in Seattle. It was a natural starting point because our executives and training team were already there, allowing us to test the concept. The response was strong—not just from learners but also from nonprofits and government organizations interested in helping their communities develop cloud skills. Now, we’ve expanded to locations in Arlington and Cape Town, South Africa. How does the AWS Skills Lab differ from college degrees in computer science or typical workforce development programs like coding boot camps? Does it offer any unique value to job seekers exploring alternative pathways into cloud computing? The Skills Centers offer hands-on classroom experiences led by AWS experts, where students can see how the skills they learn apply to industries like robotics and gaming. Additionally, we host sessions featuring employers and other organizations that share insights about careers in the cloud. Representatives from outside AWS discuss the skills they look for in employees for various roles. And importantly, all of this is free. What do you think is the advantage of AWS Skills instructors over computer science professors at universities? One key advantage is their real-world experience in understanding how AWS customers use our services. Another is their deep expertise in AWS tools and services. Students also have the chance to work directly with our service teams, getting a first-hand look at the types of projects they might work on at AWS. What misconceptions do students have about the AWS Skills programs? When I first heard about them, I assumed they were career development programs designed to land people jobs at AWS, but I’m sure they’re more nuanced than that. You’re right—it’s not solely about getting people job-ready. The Skills Centers are more focused on introducing students to the types of cloud jobs available and getting them started on their learning journey. For those who discover they have an aptitude for and interest in the cloud, we guide them toward next-level programs, like AWS Restart and AWS Cloud Institute, that prepare them for employment. The tech job market is tough right now, with many struggling post-layoffs and fierce competition. Does AWS tailor its skills programs to align with in-demand jobs? Despite challenges in the overall job market, there’s still a significant shortage of cloud professionals. The fastest-growing demand is for A.I.-adjacent roles like data scientists, machine learning engineers and data engineers. Over the last two years, we’ve seen accelerated demand for skills in A.I., machine learning, big data and security, which have become some of our most popular courses. There’s also a notable wage premium for A.I. skills—up to 45 percent higher pay for roles in finance, HR, marketing, and sales that require proficiency with A.I.-powered tools. Job seekers often worry that A.I. automation will replace jobs. How does the AWS Skills Lab prepare students to remain employable in the face of these trends? A.I. will undoubtedly change jobs, but it will also create new ones. Existing roles will become more productive with A.I., as it allows for automation of routine tasks, giving people more time to focus on creativity and innovation. The Skills Centers help students understand these changes, demystify A.I., and show what’s possible. This is just the next major technological shift, similar to the rise of the internet. What specific skills taught at AWS are less likely to be replaced by A.I.? Creativity and innovation are irreplaceable. A.I. is a tool, but humans must define the application, solve problems, and generate ideas. Additionally, effectively using A.I. tools requires foundational skills. For instance, with coding companions like the Amazon Q Developer (formerly known as CodeWhisperer), you need to know how to craft prompts to get the desired results. Learning prompt engineering can significantly boost productivity. What’s next for the AWS Skills Lab? We’ll continue to refresh and adapt our training to ensure it remains relevant. This includes introducing new in-person experiences and programs. The cloud and tech landscape evolves daily, so it’s crucial for people to keep building and updating their skills to stay competitive.

Title: Nvidia Stock Limps To Correction Territory As AI Leader’s Post-Election Slump Deepens

Longtime Wall Street favorite Nvidia extended a rare down stretch, as shares of the artificial intelligence colossus slipped into correction territory, a ding that comes as Nvidia’s trillion-dollar peers enjoy a robust period of gains. A Nvidia display in Shanghai. Nvidia stock fell 1.7% Monday to $132, its lowest end-of-day share price since Oct. 15. That’s 11% below the stock’s all-time closing high of $149 set Nov. 7, officially heading into a correction. Monday’s losses moved against a broader rally for technology stocks, with the Nasdaq index gaining 1.2% to a new record. And shares of each of the six other most valuable American companies – the other members of the “Magnificent Seven” group including Apple, Amazon, Facebook parent Meta, Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla – gained at least 0.7% apiece, led by Tesla’s 6% rise. 5.7%. That’s how much shares of Nvidia are down since Election Day, far underperforming the S&P 500 index’s 5% gain during the period. Notably, the six-week stretch has been a strong one for Nvidia’s big tech peers, as each of the other Magnificent Seven stocks advanced at least 9.9%. There has been no singular catalyst for the Nvidia selloff – its earnings report last month exceeded analyst estimates across the board – though the stock has previously slumped due to geopolitical fears from Nvidia’s reliance on Taiwanese manufacturers. The recent dip for Nvidia shares may be hard to digest for investors, especially in an otherwise rosy market, but the stock’s longer-term returns are still eye popping. Nvidia’s 170% year-to-date return is the best of any company valued at more than $200 billion, according to FactSet data, with shares up a whopping 700% over the last two years. Nvidia rose to prominence over the last two years as the unquestioned market leader in designing the semiconductor technology powering generative AI, causing its market capitalization to grow from below $300 billion in late 2022 to as high as $3.6 trillion last month. Nvidia, whose clientele includes Amazon and Microsoft, translated the surging interest in generative AI into a significant upswing in its financial performance, as sales grew by more than 600% during Nvidia’s most recent quarter compared to 2022’s comparable period. Nvidia is still the third-largest company in the world by market value, trailing only Apple and Microsoft. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Why the rally in chip stocks could broaden beyond AI in 2025, according to BofA

Chip stocks will continue to get a boost from artificial intelligence enthusiasm next year but other trends will emerge to help drive semiconductor shares higher later in the year, Bank of America said. The bank's analysts, led by Vivek Arya, say AI chip stocks will continue to surge before the rally broadens toward less-crowded auto and industrial chipmaker stocks in the second half of 2025. "We see 2025 as a year of two different trends," the analysts said in a note on Monday. In the first half of the year, they see AI semiconductor stocks sustaining strong momentum as excitement continues to build and Nvidia rolls out its new Blackwell GPU. The chip giant's next-gen Blackwell chip has been highly anticipated given its increase in power over the company's current Hopper chip, as companies look for increasingly powerful tools to train and run AI models. The analysts say the strong demand for the chips from US cloud customers like Google and Meta should help the rally sustain momentum, though delivery uncertainties for the chips are a lingering risk after initial shipment delays. "We expect the AI investments driven by AI training and scaling of models to continue, doubling down on the NVDA Blackwell deployment ramps driven by cloud customers," they said. In the second half of the year, though, the analysts see investor interest shifting as AI stocks potentially peak amid concerns about returns on heavy investments by companies in the space. "In AI we continue to trust.. at least till 2H25," the analysts said. "AI stocks could potentially peak in 2H25E when investors start to get concerned about tougher YoY compares in 2026E following two years of 100%+ annual growth in AI silicon." They say sentiment could shift toward auto and industrial chipmaker stocks as a global economic recovery replenishes inventory and boosts auto production. "In the second half, we expect a pickup in auto/industrial semis as customer/channel inventories normalize (replenishment + easy comps), as well as a pick-up in global auto production," the analysts said. The shift would mark a broadening in the semiconductor rally, which has seen the sector over 30% so far this year as AI chipmakers like Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor surge. The analysts see semiconductors maintaining their strong momentum to boost sales by 15% to $725 billion in 2025, marking a slight slowdown from a 20% rise expected for the full year in 2024.

Title: 10 business leaders who spearheaded industry-transforming change in 2024

Innovation and business go hand in hand — and that's constantly on enterprise leaders' minds, regardless of their industry. Executives must understand how technological advancements, systemic barriers, and generational shifts are affecting their growth, then strategize accordingly. Business Insider's annual list of people transforming business highlights these leaders who work in media, finance, technology, transportation, and labor. The WNBA's first female commissioner, Cathy Engelbert, is spearheading a transformation in the sports sector with her focus on fan engagement and equity among players. In finance, Leon Sinclair is leveraging data and analytics to reshape the world of alternative investments at Preqin, where he's an executive vice president. Mike Hopkins, the head of Amazon's Prime Video and MGM Studios, is forging an ad-focused entertainment-business strategy that could redefine how content is made and consumed in the digital age. Below, in alphabetical order by first name, are the 10 business leaders our reporters and editors credit with shaking up and remolding their industries. Employers often say they prefer to hire employees who act like owners. As the executive director of the nonprofit Ownership Works, Miller aims to get employers to act on that ethos. "It's not credible to ask employees to feel, think, and act like owners if you don't give them a financial ownership stake," Miller said. Since its founding in 2021, Ownership Works and its corporate partners have shared $570 million in wealth across six companies and worked with more than 160,000 workers at 113 companies. One way Miller seeks to convince business owners of the merits of employee shareholding is by showing them how it can improve the bottom line. She pointed to a time an employee in an Ownership Works company helped their employer save money by replacing a component costing $100 with a 3D printed part that cost just a few dollars. "They often know where the company is losing money or making a mistake or where things could be better," Miller said. "And they often have ideas for how to fix the problem. It's just nobody ever asked them to." Miller's career in employee ownership grew out of an interest in community development. Early in her career she helped a nonprofit in Hawaii create farming cooperatives, and she worked with another nonprofit to convert small businesses into worker cooperatives. Miller said she wanted to find scale, so she approached Pete Stavros, KKR's cohead of private equity. Stavros first experimented with employee ownership at a garage-door manufacturer in 2015, leading to some of KKR's best results. He was looking to spread that model further. After announcing the creation of Ownership Works with a $10 million donation, Stavros hired Miller as his first employee. Now it's her job to help the company's 35 private-equity partners, including KKR and Apollo, institute plans in their portfolios. She does this in part by partnering with accountants, lawyers, and professional-services firms to make it easier to create these plans, acting as an employee-ownership consultancy. The organization also collects and shares metrics of success, such as hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to employees and decreasing turnover and higher profits at companies with employee ownership. She's helping the nonprofit expand beyond private equity. Ownership Works recently worked with the cold-storage company Lineage to give $100 million in IPO proceeds to its employees and create a stock-ownership plan. Miller believes that expanding employee ownership could significantly narrow the wealth gap and reduce financial insecurity. Sadoun said he mostly received pushback when, in 2017, he told creative agencies that the future of creativity was commerce and AI. "It's funny when you look at what happened now," Sadoun, the chief executive of the French advertising giant Publicis Groupe, told BI. Back then, Sadoun faced a daunting task. He had just taken over as the third-ever leader of the 91-year-old company, home to the storied agencies Leo Burnett, Saatchi & Saatchi, and Publicis Conseil, which had created iconic advertising like the Marlboro Man, Tony the Tiger, and "Labour Isn't Working." But Publicis was languishing behind its competitors having lost key clients like McDonald's. Financial growth was anemic. Sadoun embarked on a plan to turn Publicis from a communications partner to a company that could help clients transform their businesses. He sought to break down silos between Publicis' various agencies and help them retool around a bet on "personalization at scale," advanced by the biggest acquisition in its history: the 2019 purchase of the data marketing firm Epsilon for $4.4 billion. "The financial market did not like that," Sadoun said. Neither did many of Publicis' own employees, particularly the Don Draper-esque creatives who were maddened that an outsize focus on data and programmatic ads meant the Parisian company would lose its je ne sais quoi. Competitors mocked Publicis' multimillion-dollar investment in creating an AI platform. Sadoun and Publicis are having the last laugh. At about $27 billion, Publicis' market capitalization is the largest of any individual advertising-agency holding company. It's forecast to end the year with the largest annual revenue, too, with the combination of its data and media offerings representing about half of its sales. While 2024 was a cause for celebration, it faces challenges ahead: This month, its rival Omnicom announced a deal to acquire Interpublic Group that would create the largest ad-agency network. Sadoun described Publicis' award-winning campaign for the French telco Orange as a good outward representation of its modernized offering to marketers. The commercial begins with stars from the French men's national football team flaunting their skills. The reveal — using VFX and deepfake technology — is that the stars of the ad were in fact from Les Bleues, the women's national team. Sadoun credits his leadership team and employees for Publicis' turnaround. He has a more personal hope for his own legacy. In 2022, Sadoun had an operation to remove a tumor in his neck that turned out to be cancerous. Unusually for the CEO of a public company, he disclosed his diagnosis before he underwent treatment: grueling rounds of chemo and radiotherapy that would affect the jet-setting executive's ability to travel. He was flooded with messages revealing that many people were hiding their chronic illnesses from their employers and colleagues. The following year, Sadoun helped launch the Working with Cancer Pledge, which encourages companies to commit to offering more recovery-focused working environments. More than 600 companies have signed up, and the initiative was promoted with a splashy Super Bowl ad bought and created by Publicis last year. "My one mission in life now, apart from my family, is to erase the stigma of cancer in the workplace," Sadoun said. 2024 was a transformative year for the WNBA. It said that attendance increased by nearly 50% year over year and that ratings on ESPN were up by 170% from last season, fueled in part by its rookie stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. Sponsorship deals have boomed, bringing in advertisers newer to the sports world like Bumble and Skims. Presiding over its astronomical growth is Engelbert, a former Deloitte CEO who became the league's commissioner in 2019. The league has been planting the seeds of its growth for a while. It gained attention by playing during the pandemic in a bubble. It raised $75 million from investors, allowing it to invest in marketing and fan engagement. And it landed sponsorships on its own, separate from the NBA. External factors like the rise of "name, image, and likeness" deals and social media also helped draw attention to the sport. "The thing that was overlooked is that Rome wasn't built in a day," Engelbert told BI. "We didn't do this overnight." One emphasis was on improving the fan experience by meeting spectators where they were, such as updating the app to look more like TikTok, Engelbert said. The WBNA is a big brand now, and with its growth has come scrutiny. Engelbert took heat when she didn't directly condemn threatening comments on social media toward players but likened the situation to a rivalry between male players in the 1970s. She later apologized, promising to do better. "We've been debriefing around a lot of things that happened this year," Engelbert told BI, adding that the league was looking at beefing up security and mental-health resources. "The vitriol our players, me, we all get, we're going to try to tackle that multidimensionally." Engelbert also wants to talk about the flip side. "There's a huge negative to all the vitriol, but there's also people caring about the league like they haven't before," she said. "Apathy's the death of a brand, and there's no more apathy." The WNBA, which is majority-owned by the NBA, remains unprofitable; several outlets described sources as saying it was on track to lose $40 million or more this season. The WNBA declined to comment. Increased sponsorship and media rights will be crucial to keeping up the W's momentum and getting in the black. In a big start, the women's league recently struck an 11-year, $200 million media-rights deal, up from its current deal of $60 million a year. Engelbert also has her sights set on global expansion, starting with the WNBA getting its first Canadian franchise next year. Corporate sponsorships are catching up to the rise of women's sports. Engelbert is ready to capitalize, with stats to appeal to the bottom line. "There's a little scratching and clawing to make sure the old view of the WNBA is not the current view," she said. "Our fans are actually likely to buy from you. So we say this is a good business decision for you." Almost 20 years ago, while she taught at Princeton, Li, known as the "godmother of AI," tested the hypothesis that everything humans could see could be categorized and labeled. This idea built off her graduate research focused on object recognition. Li harnessed the power of crowdsourcing to pioneer ImageNet, a database of 15 million images that became the foundation of computer-vision and deep-learning research. Li has continued advancing this research. This year, she and the leading AI researchers Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner, and Ben Mildenhall launched World Labs, a startup that aims to take AI beyond large language models. It's valued at $1 billion. With $230 million in funding from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, AMD Ventures, and Nvidia's NVentures, World Labs is seeking to explore AI applications in the two-dimensional plane of pixels and in 3D worlds with spatial intelligence. In December, World Labs dropped its first AI project: a tool designed to turn any image into a 3D model. Since her initial research breakthroughs, Li has testified before Congress about applying responsible ethics to AI and has advocated the inclusion of more women and people of color in the field. "Language is important but, as humans, much of our ability to understand and interact with the world is based on what we see," Li wrote in an op-ed article in The Economist in November. She believes spatial intelligence — which can help with developing robots that look after older adults, or extra hands for a surgeon — is what truly human-centered AI will look like. She's now a codirector of Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered AI and serves as the Sequoia Capital professor of computer science at Stanford. Li has also worked as a vice president and chief scientist of AI and machine learning at Google Cloud. Huang is becoming the stuff of legend. He has a reputation as a genius, a visionary, and a workaholic. Bosses everywhere want to know his every theory of management to replicate even a fraction of his success. That's because Nvidia has gone from a niche tech firm to one of the most valuable companies in the world in a little more than two years. After decades of toiling out of the limelight, providing the video-gaming industry with graphics chips to render complex, ever-changing imagery but not gaining much name recognition beyond it, Nvidia burst into broader consciousness in 2022, after ChatGPT came to the market. Word quickly spread that the company had for years been buying thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units — it turned out that the kind of computing they're best at is similar to the demands of artificial intelligence. Huang actually donated OpenAI's first eight GPUs, delivering them himself. But Huang anticipated the connection between his chips and AI long before then — he just didn't know how it would materialize. Huang, 61, was born in southwestern Taiwan. He studied electrical engineering at the University of Oregon and Stanford. He had a few jobs in the semiconductor industry, including at Nvidia's major competitor AMD, until he founded Nvidia at 30 with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Despite the recent spotlight on him now, Huang has staying power. He's one the longest-serving tech CEOs, with more than 30 years at the helm. In a recently published memoir, Morris Chang, the founder of Nvidia's most important supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, described offering Huang the CEO job at TSMC. Even now that Nvidia has a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, Huang sees his work as far from finished. "I watched Jensen make these kinds of bets that are far-reaching, where there's a lot of ambiguity as to when it's going to happen or not," Rev Lebaredian, a vice president of omniverse and simulation technology at Nvidia, told Business Insider this year. Huang is usually right. The journey to enter 2025 with hundreds of foundation models chasing ChatGPT started for Nvidia in about 2006. The next big journey may be self-driving cars and robots, or something else entirely. Some investors still worry that when it comes to Nvidia, what goes up must come down. But investors also believe that if anyone can see or make the future, it's Huang. Sinclair, who grew up in the market town of Rugby in the middle of England, didn't picture a career in finance. "We never really spoke about money around the dinner table or anything like that because there was never any of it," the 42-year-old told Business Insider in an interview. Now Sinclair is helping demystify private markets and powering its growth through data. With civil service in mind, he studied political science at Loughborough University and joined England's Department of Health shortly after graduating in 2004. But Sinclair, a competitive basketball and track athlete, quickly tired of the bureaucracy and craved a faster-paced work culture. After six months, he left for a research-analyst position at Intercontinental Exchange, the operator of major stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and clearinghouses. The finance novice was eager to catch up and learn as much as he could about debt products and subprime markets. He left in 2010 for the data provider Markit, well before the firm merged with IHS and was acquired by S&P Global. Throughout his two-decade career he has maintained a sense of intellectual curiosity, describing himself as one of the most avid readers of industry news among his peers. Drawn to the complexity of private markets, he pivoted away from credit to build IHS Markit's private-equity and debt division. In 2023, he joined the private-markets-data powerhouse Preqin. "You see some of the most innovative companies in the world, and you work with some of the most innovative funds in the world who are deploying capital into just really interesting spaces," he said. Sinclair oversees how Preqin addresses the needs of fund managers, investment banks, and placement agents, representing some 3,000 front-office teams, trying to navigate the opaque industry of private markets. Preqin says the asset class has more than doubled to $16.8 trillion in assets under management over the past five years. Preqin's data can be used, for instance, to target limited partners for fundraising or create customized benchmarks to better convey performance to investors. Private markets are becoming more transparent as providers like Preqin find ways to combine publicly available and proprietary data, Sinclair said. In June, his division launched a data tool to analyze deals across 6,500 funds. This aggregated data can be used to back up valuations in negotiations or identify which financial factors, such as revenue growth or debt pay-down, contributed the most value to a successful deal. The firm's insights are set to become more widely available, as BlackRock is set to acquire Preqin for $3.2 billion. Sinclair said it's easier for individual investors to participate in private markets than ever before, pointing to the growth of data products and favorable regulatory developments. But he added that having options isn't the same as understanding them. "There's a massive amount of education to do. Alternatives have a totally different vocabulary, a different way of thinking about performance, a different way of thinking about risks to the types of products," he said. "I think there's also an obligation of the industry to build the right analytical tools, the right educational tools, datasets to bring the mass affluent along on that journey." The electric-vehicle market has experienced tremendous upheaval in the past year, and car companies are scrambling to understand today's EV buyers. At Ford, Gjaja, the chief operating officer of the Model e electric division, is tasked with navigating the money-losing division through huge changes in demand and customer profiles. After years of growth in the EV segment driven by wealthy early adopters, car companies face the challenge of selling these expensive and complex vehicles to more-regular customers. Ford split its gas and electric divisions in 2022 in a bid to speed up EV development. The company's EV strategy has changed a few times since then, but Ford still breaks out its financial performance: So far in 2024, the Model e division has lost $3.6 billion. In his operations role, Gjaja is trying to reverse those losses by working with Ford's dealers to improve customer experiences and perceptions. Before joining Ford in 2022, Gjaja was a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group, where he worked with clients in retail, technology, and automotive, among other industries. He's putting those years of consulting experience to work as Ford tries to bridge the gap between the wealthy early adopters behind the initial success of vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 Lighting and the more-practical customers who more often leave the lot with a hybrid. While higher prices have turned off some of these new EV shoppers, Gjaja said at an automotive conference in September that this cohort was considering a lot more than sticker price — including their distance from the nearest charger, the cost of charging, battery life, and resale values. Gjaja argued that simply discounting electric cars wouldn't be enough to convince shoppers and certainly wouldn't solve Ford's profitability problem in its Model e division. Instead of focusing on "functional economics," Gjaja said, he examines the "behavioral economics" of EV adoption. He said the journey from what he called an EV denier to a long-term convert could take up to three years. "My job is to figure out how to sell and market a vehicle that people don't appreciate its value until they own it for three years," Gjaja said. Amazon is a retail and cloud powerhouse, and thanks to Hopkins, it's become a media powerhouse, too. Under Hopkins, Amazon now offers not just a wide variety of TV and films but some of the biggest sports franchises like the NFL and the NBA, and even news. Amazon spent $18.9 billion on video and music in 2023, up by 14% from 2022. According to the data firm Ampere Analysis, sports is a growing part of Amazon's entertainment outlay, accounting for 14.3% in 2024, up from virtually nothing five years ago. Amazon's entertainment offerings help keep people subscribing to Prime, the free-delivery service that includes Prime Video and other benefits. But it's also becoming a moneymaker in its own right. In January, Amazon shook up the streaming-ads market when it turned on ads in Prime Video, driving down ad prices for competitors like Netflix while giving Amazon a big shot at the $28.8 billion pie that EMARKETER has forecast will be spent on streaming-TV ads this year. Morgan Stanley has estimated the move could bring in $3.3 billion in revenue this year, on top of Amazon's existing ad business, worth $47 billion in 2023. And with NFL and other streaming rights, Amazon is muscling in on traditional TV networks' turf and training viewers that it's the place to go for live sports. It's even dipped a toe in news, the last stronghold of traditional TV, with a Brian Williams-hosted election-night special. Hopkins' hire in 2020, along with the NBC entertainment vet Jennifer Salke's two years earlier, was a big signal that Amazon was serious about establishing itself as a key player in entertainment. Hopkins is a product of legacy and digital entertainment, having been the chairman of Sony Pictures Television and the CEO of Hulu. At Amazon, he oversaw the $8.5 billion acquisition of the film studio MGM and pushed the company's entertainment studio to expand into broader fare. Prime Video also makes money by fulfilling its promise of being a one-stop shop for viewers by selling subscriptions to other companies' apps like Max, Starz, and, in its most recent flex, Apple TV+. "What we're trying to build is a next-generation entertainment service," Hopkins recently told Bloomberg. Prime Video captured just 3.7% of TV viewing in November, well behind Netflix (7.7%) and YouTube (10.8%), per Nielsen. Despite some wins, like the popular show "The Boys" and the buzzy film "Saltburn," it has a way to go in becoming a consistent hit factory. Still, since most people don't pay for Prime Video as a stand-alone service, it doesn't have the churn problem that dogs other streamers. As part of Amazon, Prime Video is also insulated from some of the financial pressures affecting other entertainment companies. Hopkins is still bringing financial discipline to bear, however. Amazon cut hundreds of jobs across Prime Video and MGM Studios teams early in 2024. Hopkins recently told Bloomberg that the advertising ramp-up was a factor in pursuing NBA rights and that he expected Prime Video to be profitable "very soon." Since 2021, Varkey has been the president of the Mayo Clinic Health System, a network of 16 community hospitals and 45 multispecialty clinics across more than three dozen communities in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The facilities serve rural areas where care can otherwise be difficult to access. Varkey, who comes from a family of physicians, said her work focused on reaching patients without ready access to the sprawling Mayo Clinic campus in Rochester, Minnesota, and its world-renowned medical expertise. Varkey told Business Insider that part of her focus was finding new ways to incorporate technology so that more people can obtain care and administrative burdens can be reduced. That includes using artificial intelligence to help with diagnosing conditions and using technology so that clinicians can manage complex chronic conditions virtually. The efforts also include introducing a mobile clinic that can go where routine and preventive care is needed and even provide wireless internet access so patients can confer with specialists. The clinic, which travels across southern Minnesota, offers virtual or in-person appointments. It has two exam rooms and a laboratory. "So now you have preventive exams, specialist visits that are occurring in very remote areas," she said. Varkey said Mayo Clinic Health System was also trying to bring medical expertise to rural residents through programs that connect small local clinics with specialists from hub sites or from Mayo's Rochester campus. Small clinics, she said, might have only a single nurse practitioner — nothing like the variety of disciplines a larger facility would have. "It's been very exciting to watch, and patients have really appreciated it as well," Varkey said. Another effort to meet patients where they are is the organization's hospital-at-home program. Varkey said remote monitoring technology helped these patients remain with family and be more comfortable than they'd be in a medical facility. "You get the same Mayo care," she said, adding that the approach had been popular with patients. Varkey, who also holds an MBA from the University of Minnesota, returned to Mayo in 2021 after serving as the president and CEO of Yale New Haven Health Northeast Medical Group. From 2001 to 2013, Varkey held leadership positions at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, including associate chair of the Department of Medicine, medical director of Ask Mayo Clinic, and program director of the Preventive Medicine Fellowship. Varkey said the expanding capabilities of AI and discoveries in genomics and molecular medicine were "taking healthcare to the next level — and very fast." While those developments are exciting, Varkey said, they shouldn't distract from the primary goal of patient-centered care. Kapila likes to stay ahead of the game. During the first 10 years of his career, the computer-science graduate completed four certifications each year while working as a tech consultant for firms like Nasdaq and Sallie Mae. While working at the hedge fund Citadel in the mid-2000s, he took MBA classes at night at Northwestern University. "Everything in this field changes so quickly," he said. "Things change in finance and things change in tech at an ever increasing pace." Now Kapila is a copresident and chief operating officer of Parametric, a pioneer of direct indexing with $570 billion in assets under management. He joined Parametric in 2019 after rising up the ranks at BlackRock, overseeing portfolio construction management for its widely used Aladdin platform. Kapila moved to a much smaller firm to have a bigger impact. "It was an opportunity to kind of look at what Parametric has done well, think about how to build on the success, but then also take advantage of what's happening in the technology space and rethink how Parametric could operate, let's say, five years from that point," he said. His move was well timed. There has been a boom in direct indexing, a tax-savvy investing strategy of buying individual securities modeled off an index like the S&P 500. Two years after Kapila joined Parametric, Morgan Stanley acquired Parametric's parent company, Eaton Vance. Thanks to a wave of similar acquisitions, Parametric faces well-capitalized competitors such as BlackRock's Aperio and Franklin Templeton's Canvas. Industry stalwarts like Fidelity and upstarts like Envestnet also want a piece of the action. Kapila said Parametric, founded in 1987, has experience and scale on its side. "I will say that given the technology trends, sometimes it's easy to come in and have a solution. It's much, much harder to have a scalable solution that will serve clients when the demand spikes," he said. "We're managing over 200,000 accounts for our clients. The level of scale, I think, often is a breaking point for some of the newer entrants." To stay ahead of the competition, Kapila is pushing Parametric to develop more automated products, such as Radius, which launched this year. Radius constructs fixed-income and equity portfolios and runs simulations to identify the best selections for portfolio managers. Kapila described it as a "turning point" for Parametric. "This is the first time we've had a product that's really end-to-end running in that automated platform manner with a person reviewing and approving and intervening as necessary," he said. He plans to launch more cloud-native tools, which are easier to scale and manage, for other asset classes in 2025 and 2026. Parametric is also bringing its tax-savvy strategies to active management, launching Custom Active this summer. Rather than modeling portfolios off indexes, clients can pick equities off strategies from its asset-management partner Lazard or sports-league sponsors. "Those are examples where we can provide a tax overlay and help people get the advantages of direct indexing while managing to an active model," Kapila said. "There's a demand for that, and it's early days," he added, "but I think that's really what's playing out."

Innovation and business go hand in hand — and that's constantly on enterprise leaders' minds, regardless of their industry. Executives must understand how technological advancements, systemic barriers, and generational shifts are affecting their growth, then strategize accordingly. Business Insider's annual list of people transforming business highlights these leaders who work in media, finance, technology, transportation, and labor. The WNBA's first female commissioner, Cathy Engelbert, is spearheading a transformation in the sports sector with her focus on fan engagement and equity among players. In finance, Leon Sinclair is leveraging data and analytics to reshape the world of alternative investments at Preqin, where he's an executive vice president. Mike Hopkins, the head of Amazon's Prime Video and MGM Studios, is forging an ad-focused entertainment-business strategy that could redefine how content is made and consumed in the digital age. Below, in alphabetical order by first name, are the 10 business leaders our reporters and editors credit with shaking up and remolding their industries. Employers often say they prefer to hire employees who act like owners. As the executive director of the nonprofit Ownership Works, Miller aims to get employers to act on that ethos. "It's not credible to ask employees to feel, think, and act like owners if you don't give them a financial ownership stake," Miller said. Since its founding in 2021, Ownership Works and its corporate partners have shared $570 million in wealth across six companies and worked with more than 160,000 workers at 113 companies. One way Miller seeks to convince business owners of the merits of employee shareholding is by showing them how it can improve the bottom line. She pointed to a time an employee in an Ownership Works company helped their employer save money by replacing a component costing $100 with a 3D printed part that cost just a few dollars. "They often know where the company is losing money or making a mistake or where things could be better," Miller said. "And they often have ideas for how to fix the problem. It's just nobody ever asked them to." Miller's career in employee ownership grew out of an interest in community development. Early in her career she helped a nonprofit in Hawaii create farming cooperatives, and she worked with another nonprofit to convert small businesses into worker cooperatives. Miller said she wanted to find scale, so she approached Pete Stavros, KKR's cohead of private equity. Stavros first experimented with employee ownership at a garage-door manufacturer in 2015, leading to some of KKR's best results. He was looking to spread that model further. After announcing the creation of Ownership Works with a $10 million donation, Stavros hired Miller as his first employee. Now it's her job to help the company's 35 private-equity partners, including KKR and Apollo, institute plans in their portfolios. She does this in part by partnering with accountants, lawyers, and professional-services firms to make it easier to create these plans, acting as an employee-ownership consultancy. The organization also collects and shares metrics of success, such as hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to employees and decreasing turnover and higher profits at companies with employee ownership. She's helping the nonprofit expand beyond private equity. Ownership Works recently worked with the cold-storage company Lineage to give $100 million in IPO proceeds to its employees and create a stock-ownership plan. Miller believes that expanding employee ownership could significantly narrow the wealth gap and reduce financial insecurity. Sadoun said he mostly received pushback when, in 2017, he told creative agencies that the future of creativity was commerce and AI. "It's funny when you look at what happened now," Sadoun, the chief executive of the French advertising giant Publicis Groupe, told BI. Back then, Sadoun faced a daunting task. He had just taken over as the third-ever leader of the 91-year-old company, home to the storied agencies Leo Burnett, Saatchi & Saatchi, and Publicis Conseil, which had created iconic advertising like the Marlboro Man, Tony the Tiger, and "Labour Isn't Working." But Publicis was languishing behind its competitors having lost key clients like McDonald's. Financial growth was anemic. Sadoun embarked on a plan to turn Publicis from a communications partner to a company that could help clients transform their businesses. He sought to break down silos between Publicis' various agencies and help them retool around a bet on "personalization at scale," advanced by the biggest acquisition in its history: the 2019 purchase of the data marketing firm Epsilon for $4.4 billion. "The financial market did not like that," Sadoun said. Neither did many of Publicis' own employees, particularly the Don Draper-esque creatives who were maddened that an outsize focus on data and programmatic ads meant the Parisian company would lose its je ne sais quoi. Competitors mocked Publicis' multimillion-dollar investment in creating an AI platform. Sadoun and Publicis are having the last laugh. At about $27 billion, Publicis' market capitalization is the largest of any individual advertising-agency holding company. It's forecast to end the year with the largest annual revenue, too, with the combination of its data and media offerings representing about half of its sales. While 2024 was a cause for celebration, it faces challenges ahead: This month, its rival Omnicom announced a deal to acquire Interpublic Group that would create the largest ad-agency network. Sadoun described Publicis' award-winning campaign for the French telco Orange as a good outward representation of its modernized offering to marketers. The commercial begins with stars from the French men's national football team flaunting their skills. The reveal — using VFX and deepfake technology — is that the stars of the ad were in fact from Les Bleues, the women's national team. Sadoun credits his leadership team and employees for Publicis' turnaround. He has a more personal hope for his own legacy. In 2022, Sadoun had an operation to remove a tumor in his neck that turned out to be cancerous. Unusually for the CEO of a public company, he disclosed his diagnosis before he underwent treatment: grueling rounds of chemo and radiotherapy that would affect the jet-setting executive's ability to travel. He was flooded with messages revealing that many people were hiding their chronic illnesses from their employers and colleagues. The following year, Sadoun helped launch the Working with Cancer Pledge, which encourages companies to commit to offering more recovery-focused working environments. More than 600 companies have signed up, and the initiative was promoted with a splashy Super Bowl ad bought and created by Publicis last year. "My one mission in life now, apart from my family, is to erase the stigma of cancer in the workplace," Sadoun said. 2024 was a transformative year for the WNBA. It said that attendance increased by nearly 50% year over year and that ratings on ESPN were up by 170% from last season, fueled in part by its rookie stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. Sponsorship deals have boomed, bringing in advertisers newer to the sports world like Bumble and Skims. Presiding over its astronomical growth is Engelbert, a former Deloitte CEO who became the league's commissioner in 2019. The league has been planting the seeds of its growth for a while. It gained attention by playing during the pandemic in a bubble. It raised $75 million from investors, allowing it to invest in marketing and fan engagement. And it landed sponsorships on its own, separate from the NBA. External factors like the rise of "name, image, and likeness" deals and social media also helped draw attention to the sport. "The thing that was overlooked is that Rome wasn't built in a day," Engelbert told BI. "We didn't do this overnight." One emphasis was on improving the fan experience by meeting spectators where they were, such as updating the app to look more like TikTok, Engelbert said. The WBNA is a big brand now, and with its growth has come scrutiny. Engelbert took heat when she didn't directly condemn threatening comments on social media toward players but likened the situation to a rivalry between male players in the 1970s. She later apologized, promising to do better. "We've been debriefing around a lot of things that happened this year," Engelbert told BI, adding that the league was looking at beefing up security and mental-health resources. "The vitriol our players, me, we all get, we're going to try to tackle that multidimensionally." Engelbert also wants to talk about the flip side. "There's a huge negative to all the vitriol, but there's also people caring about the league like they haven't before," she said. "Apathy's the death of a brand, and there's no more apathy." The WNBA, which is majority-owned by the NBA, remains unprofitable; several outlets described sources as saying it was on track to lose $40 million or more this season. The WNBA declined to comment. Increased sponsorship and media rights will be crucial to keeping up the W's momentum and getting in the black. In a big start, the women's league recently struck an 11-year, $200 million media-rights deal, up from its current deal of $60 million a year. Engelbert also has her sights set on global expansion, starting with the WNBA getting its first Canadian franchise next year. Corporate sponsorships are catching up to the rise of women's sports. Engelbert is ready to capitalize, with stats to appeal to the bottom line. "There's a little scratching and clawing to make sure the old view of the WNBA is not the current view," she said. "Our fans are actually likely to buy from you. So we say this is a good business decision for you." Almost 20 years ago, while she taught at Princeton, Li, known as the "godmother of AI," tested the hypothesis that everything humans could see could be categorized and labeled. This idea built off her graduate research focused on object recognition. Li harnessed the power of crowdsourcing to pioneer ImageNet, a database of 15 million images that became the foundation of computer-vision and deep-learning research. Li has continued advancing this research. This year, she and the leading AI researchers Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner, and Ben Mildenhall launched World Labs, a startup that aims to take AI beyond large language models. It's valued at $1 billion. With $230 million in funding from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, AMD Ventures, and Nvidia's NVentures, World Labs is seeking to explore AI applications in the two-dimensional plane of pixels and in 3D worlds with spatial intelligence. In December, World Labs dropped its first AI project: a tool designed to turn any image into a 3D model. Since her initial research breakthroughs, Li has testified before Congress about applying responsible ethics to AI and has advocated the inclusion of more women and people of color in the field. "Language is important but, as humans, much of our ability to understand and interact with the world is based on what we see," Li wrote in an op-ed article in The Economist in November. She believes spatial intelligence — which can help with developing robots that look after older adults, or extra hands for a surgeon — is what truly human-centered AI will look like. She's now a codirector of Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered AI and serves as the Sequoia Capital professor of computer science at Stanford. Li has also worked as a vice president and chief scientist of AI and machine learning at Google Cloud. Huang is becoming the stuff of legend. He has a reputation as a genius, a visionary, and a workaholic. Bosses everywhere want to know his every theory of management to replicate even a fraction of his success. That's because Nvidia has gone from a niche tech firm to one of the most valuable companies in the world in a little more than two years. After decades of toiling out of the limelight, providing the video-gaming industry with graphics chips to render complex, ever-changing imagery but not gaining much name recognition beyond it, Nvidia burst into broader consciousness in 2022, after ChatGPT came to the market. Word quickly spread that the company had for years been buying thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units — it turned out that the kind of computing they're best at is similar to the demands of artificial intelligence. Huang actually donated OpenAI's first eight GPUs, delivering them himself. But Huang anticipated the connection between his chips and AI long before then — he just didn't know how it would materialize. Huang, 61, was born in southwestern Taiwan. He studied electrical engineering at the University of Oregon and Stanford. He had a few jobs in the semiconductor industry, including at Nvidia's major competitor AMD, until he founded Nvidia at 30 with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Despite the recent spotlight on him now, Huang has staying power. He's one the longest-serving tech CEOs, with more than 30 years at the helm. In a recently published memoir, Morris Chang, the founder of Nvidia's most important supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, described offering Huang the CEO job at TSMC. Even now that Nvidia has a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, Huang sees his work as far from finished. "I watched Jensen make these kinds of bets that are far-reaching, where there's a lot of ambiguity as to when it's going to happen or not," Rev Lebaredian, a vice president of omniverse and simulation technology at Nvidia, told Business Insider this year. Huang is usually right. The journey to enter 2025 with hundreds of foundation models chasing ChatGPT started for Nvidia in about 2006. The next big journey may be self-driving cars and robots, or something else entirely. Some investors still worry that when it comes to Nvidia, what goes up must come down. But investors also believe that if anyone can see or make the future, it's Huang. Sinclair, who grew up in the market town of Rugby in the middle of England, didn't picture a career in finance. "We never really spoke about money around the dinner table or anything like that because there was never any of it," the 42-year-old told Business Insider in an interview. Now Sinclair is helping demystify private markets and powering its growth through data. With civil service in mind, he studied political science at Loughborough University and joined England's Department of Health shortly after graduating in 2004. But Sinclair, a competitive basketball and track athlete, quickly tired of the bureaucracy and craved a faster-paced work culture. After six months, he left for a research-analyst position at Intercontinental Exchange, the operator of major stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and clearinghouses. The finance novice was eager to catch up and learn as much as he could about debt products and subprime markets. He left in 2010 for the data provider Markit, well before the firm merged with IHS and was acquired by S&P Global. Throughout his two-decade career he has maintained a sense of intellectual curiosity, describing himself as one of the most avid readers of industry news among his peers. Drawn to the complexity of private markets, he pivoted away from credit to build IHS Markit's private-equity and debt division. In 2023, he joined the private-markets-data powerhouse Preqin. "You see some of the most innovative companies in the world, and you work with some of the most innovative funds in the world who are deploying capital into just really interesting spaces," he said. Sinclair oversees how Preqin addresses the needs of fund managers, investment banks, and placement agents, representing some 3,000 front-office teams, trying to navigate the opaque industry of private markets. Preqin says the asset class has more than doubled to $16.8 trillion in assets under management over the past five years. Preqin's data can be used, for instance, to target limited partners for fundraising or create customized benchmarks to better convey performance to investors. Private markets are becoming more transparent as providers like Preqin find ways to combine publicly available and proprietary data, Sinclair said. In June, his division launched a data tool to analyze deals across 6,500 funds. This aggregated data can be used to back up valuations in negotiations or identify which financial factors, such as revenue growth or debt pay-down, contributed the most value to a successful deal. The firm's insights are set to become more widely available, as BlackRock is set to acquire Preqin for $3.2 billion. Sinclair said it's easier for individual investors to participate in private markets than ever before, pointing to the growth of data products and favorable regulatory developments. But he added that having options isn't the same as understanding them. "There's a massive amount of education to do. Alternatives have a totally different vocabulary, a different way of thinking about performance, a different way of thinking about risks to the types of products," he said. "I think there's also an obligation of the industry to build the right analytical tools, the right educational tools, datasets to bring the mass affluent along on that journey." The electric-vehicle market has experienced tremendous upheaval in the past year, and car companies are scrambling to understand today's EV buyers. At Ford, Gjaja, the chief operating officer of the Model e electric division, is tasked with navigating the money-losing division through huge changes in demand and customer profiles. After years of growth in the EV segment driven by wealthy early adopters, car companies face the challenge of selling these expensive and complex vehicles to more-regular customers. Ford split its gas and electric divisions in 2022 in a bid to speed up EV development. The company's EV strategy has changed a few times since then, but Ford still breaks out its financial performance: So far in 2024, the Model e division has lost $3.6 billion. In his operations role, Gjaja is trying to reverse those losses by working with Ford's dealers to improve customer experiences and perceptions. Before joining Ford in 2022, Gjaja was a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group, where he worked with clients in retail, technology, and automotive, among other industries. He's putting those years of consulting experience to work as Ford tries to bridge the gap between the wealthy early adopters behind the initial success of vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 Lighting and the more-practical customers who more often leave the lot with a hybrid. While higher prices have turned off some of these new EV shoppers, Gjaja said at an automotive conference in September that this cohort was considering a lot more than sticker price — including their distance from the nearest charger, the cost of charging, battery life, and resale values. Gjaja argued that simply discounting electric cars wouldn't be enough to convince shoppers and certainly wouldn't solve Ford's profitability problem in its Model e division. Instead of focusing on "functional economics," Gjaja said, he examines the "behavioral economics" of EV adoption. He said the journey from what he called an EV denier to a long-term convert could take up to three years. "My job is to figure out how to sell and market a vehicle that people don't appreciate its value until they own it for three years," Gjaja said. Amazon is a retail and cloud powerhouse, and thanks to Hopkins, it's become a media powerhouse, too. Under Hopkins, Amazon now offers not just a wide variety of TV and films but some of the biggest sports franchises like the NFL and the NBA, and even news. Amazon spent $18.9 billion on video and music in 2023, up by 14% from 2022. According to the data firm Ampere Analysis, sports is a growing part of Amazon's entertainment outlay, accounting for 14.3% in 2024, up from virtually nothing five years ago. Amazon's entertainment offerings help keep people subscribing to Prime, the free-delivery service that includes Prime Video and other benefits. But it's also becoming a moneymaker in its own right. In January, Amazon shook up the streaming-ads market when it turned on ads in Prime Video, driving down ad prices for competitors like Netflix while giving Amazon a big shot at the $28.8 billion pie that EMARKETER has forecast will be spent on streaming-TV ads this year. Morgan Stanley has estimated the move could bring in $3.3 billion in revenue this year, on top of Amazon's existing ad business, worth $47 billion in 2023. And with NFL and other streaming rights, Amazon is muscling in on traditional TV networks' turf and training viewers that it's the place to go for live sports. It's even dipped a toe in news, the last stronghold of traditional TV, with a Brian Williams-hosted election-night special. Hopkins' hire in 2020, along with the NBC entertainment vet Jennifer Salke's two years earlier, was a big signal that Amazon was serious about establishing itself as a key player in entertainment. Hopkins is a product of legacy and digital entertainment, having been the chairman of Sony Pictures Television and the CEO of Hulu. At Amazon, he oversaw the $8.5 billion acquisition of the film studio MGM and pushed the company's entertainment studio to expand into broader fare. Prime Video also makes money by fulfilling its promise of being a one-stop shop for viewers by selling subscriptions to other companies' apps like Max, Starz, and, in its most recent flex, Apple TV+. "What we're trying to build is a next-generation entertainment service," Hopkins recently told Bloomberg. Prime Video captured just 3.7% of TV viewing in November, well behind Netflix (7.7%) and YouTube (10.8%), per Nielsen. Despite some wins, like the popular show "The Boys" and the buzzy film "Saltburn," it has a way to go in becoming a consistent hit factory. Still, since most people don't pay for Prime Video as a stand-alone service, it doesn't have the churn problem that dogs other streamers. As part of Amazon, Prime Video is also insulated from some of the financial pressures affecting other entertainment companies. Hopkins is still bringing financial discipline to bear, however. Amazon cut hundreds of jobs across Prime Video and MGM Studios teams early in 2024. Hopkins recently told Bloomberg that the advertising ramp-up was a factor in pursuing NBA rights and that he expected Prime Video to be profitable "very soon." Since 2021, Varkey has been the president of the Mayo Clinic Health System, a network of 16 community hospitals and 45 multispecialty clinics across more than three dozen communities in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The facilities serve rural areas where care can otherwise be difficult to access. Varkey, who comes from a family of physicians, said her work focused on reaching patients without ready access to the sprawling Mayo Clinic campus in Rochester, Minnesota, and its world-renowned medical expertise. Varkey told Business Insider that part of her focus was finding new ways to incorporate technology so that more people can obtain care and administrative burdens can be reduced. That includes using artificial intelligence to help with diagnosing conditions and using technology so that clinicians can manage complex chronic conditions virtually.

"This is the first time we've had a product that's really end-to-end running in that automated platform manner with a person reviewing and approving and intervening as necessary," he said. He plans to launch more cloud-native tools, which are easier to scale and manage, for other asset classes in 2025 and 2026. Parametric is also bringing its tax-savvy strategies to active management, launching Custom Active this summer. Rather than modeling portfolios off indexes, clients can pick equities off strategies from its asset-management partner Lazard or sports-league sponsors. "Those are examples where we can provide a tax overlay and help people get the advantages of direct indexing while managing to an active model," Kapila said. "There's a demand for that, and it's early days," he added, "but I think that's really what's playing out."

Ethena Labs is announcing the launch of a new US dollar-pegged stablecoin that will be backed by BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). According to a new announcement from the Arthur Hayes-backed crypto protocol, the new stablecoin, USDtb, will be Ethena’s second stablecoin offering, following the project’s flagship stablecoin USDe. USDtb differs from other stablecoins in that it will be backed by a fund backed by one of the world’s largest and most trusted asset managers, BlackRock. In October of this year, multiple reports tied BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with the idea of using BUIDL, the crypto asset related to the firm’s tokenized mutual fund, as collateral for trading derivatives contracts. BUIDL, which launched in March of this year, is a tokenized money-market fund designed to offer a stable value of $1 per token built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain that offers “blue-chip” yields. As stated by Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, in a press release issued by Securitize, BlackRock’s brokerage partner, “[BUIDL] is the latest progression of our digital assets strategy. We are focused on developing solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems for our clients.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Why TransDigm Group (TDG) Is Among the Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) stands against the other best aerospace and defense stocks to buy. According to a report by Dinan Capital Advisors, the aerospace and defense industry's EBITDA multiples increased by around 8% on average during the third quarter of 2024. Within the industry, the Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) segment stood out with the highest EBITDA multiple of more than 19%. The robust performance in the sector was driven by increased government spending, AI defense implementation, and increased global travel. As per the report, the global market size of the aerospace and defense sector is estimated to grow from $1 trillion to around $1.5 trillion during the next decade. There are various factors contributing to growth within the industry. Firstly, the defense sector is experiencing significant expansion due to the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. This rising defense demand resulted in a record defense order backlog of $747 billion, indicating an 11% increase year-over-year. Moreover, the Senate Armed Services Committee has projected that Congress will finalize the FY25 US defense budget at approximately $833 billion, exceeding last year's spending limits. In addition to increased defense spending, which is one segment of the overall aerospace and defense industry, international air traveling is also improving. According to a report by FlightGlobal, the global passenger traffic grew by 7.4% subsequently during the third quarter. Although the profitability of the global airline industry is still down by around $1.7 billion year-over-year, the subsequent growth in passengers indicates an ongoing recovery.

Mitchell Reiss, American diplomat and distinguished fellow at the Royal United Services Institute appeared on a CNBC interview on November 7 to discuss how the defense sector will perform under President-elect Donald Trump. He said that the United States government is expected to increase its defense spending under President Donald Trump. Currently, defense spending is at its lowest level since 1998 and the geopolitical situation is more dangerous than the said year. Reiss thinks that the president will double down on some of the initiatives from his first term. Trump sees China as a United States adversary and he sees Israel and Saudi Arabia as stabilizing forces in the Middle East and will want to build upon the Abraham Accords. He also thinks that the president will call upon its European allies to increase defense spending. While Reiss expects the United States' defense spending to increase, he also noted that a third of the NATO countries are still not hitting the 2% mark in terms of their defense spending. Considering the geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine, European countries would also naturally pivot towards increasing their defense spending. Reiss believes that if someone is interested in defense stocks there is a lot of growth potential within the industry.

To curate the list of the 11 best aerospace and defense stocks to buy right now, we used the Finviz stock screener. Using the screener we aggregated a list of companies working in the aerospace and defense industry and sorted them by market capitalization. Next, we sourced the number of hedge funds holding each company from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71 TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) is a company that designs, produces, and supplies specialized parts for aircraft. These parts are essential for both commercial and military airplanes. It specializes in highly engineered components which are sold as replacement (aftermarket) parts and to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). One of the key competitive edges of the company comes from its range of proprietary aerospace components which are mainly sold in the aftermarket. Management has shifted its focus to the aftermarket segment as it generates more margins, as a result around 90% of its net sales for fiscal 2023 came from this segment. In addition, TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) has also been concentrating on expanding its proprietary product portfolio and has taken some bold steps toward this goal. For instance, management acquired SEI Industries and CPI Electron Device Business during the current fiscal year. Both companies have a line-up of specialized products catering to the aerospace and defense sectors. During the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company surpassed its revenue guidance by posting $2.05 billion, up 17.3% year-over-year. Its net income was also encouraging and improved by 31% during the same time to reach $461 million. Management has also revised its full-year EBITDA guidance from $3,995 million to $4,095 million to an updated range of $4,100 million to $4,160 million. It is one of the best aerospace and defense stocks to buy right now. Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy stated the following regarding TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) reported another earnings beat-and-raise during its fiscal third quarter as it continues to benefit from a surge in global travel, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. The airlines posted no significant change in aircraft order or delivery patterns despite overcapacity issues. Both Boeing and Airbus remain in a holding pattern on producing and delivering new units due to manufacturing quality and labor issues (strike) in the case of Boeing and supply chain challenges in the case of Airbus. This plays directly into the hands of TransDigm’s most profitable business, commercial aerospace aftermarket, as load factors remain high, and take-offs and landings continue to grow beyond pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, the company announced a significant special dividend to be paid in October 2024. Even with this payment, TransDigm has over $5.5 billion of capital to execute its acquisition strategy in what should be a robust M&A market in 2025.” Overall, TDG ranks 3rd on our list of best aerospace and defense stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of TDG to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TDG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Five months later, it's out, and the stock is down 8% on the news. Nasdaq said late Friday that Super Micro is being removed from the index, which is made up of the top 100 nonfinancial stocks on the Nasdaq and is the basis for the Invesco QQQ Trust exchange-traded fund, one of the most actively traded ETFs. The announcement is the latest in a roller coaster of a year for Super Micro, whose shares rocketed to a record high of $118.81 in March, as demand soared for the company's servers packed with artificial intelligence processors. The company's market cap reached over $70 billion, high enough to merit inclusion in the S&P 500. Super Micro is now worth about $20 billion, about a quarter the size of the median market cap of companies in the Nasdaq 100. Nasdaq will also remove Illumina and Moderna from the group, effective Dec. 23. The revision will make room for the additions of Axon Enterprise and Palantir Technologies, as well as MicroStrategy, a company whose value is tied to its billions of dollars worth of bitcoin purchases. MicroStrategy shares have gained more than 500% so far this year and were flat in Monday's trading. For Super Micro, the story started to turn in August, when the company said it wouldn't file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company and said in a report that it identified "fresh evidence of accounting manipulation." In October, Ernst & Young resigned as Super Micro's auditor, resulting in a 33% stock plunge. An independent special board committee evaluated concerns from Ernst & Young and found no misconduct following a three-month investigation. The report recommended the company replace its CFO. The company said in November that BDO was its new auditor. Super Micro was at risk of being delisted from Nasdaq altogether for a second time because of its delayed financial reports, but two weeks ago it received an extension until February 2025. In a preliminary earnings report, the company said revenue for the third quarter was up 181% year over year, below consensus. "Competition is strong, but I believe we are in good position," CEO Charles Liang said during a November conference call with analysts. Rivals include Dell and HPE.

getty Looking to secure huge growth potential with artificial intelligence stocks? The timeline may be short. While few expect AI spending to decline in the short term, stock prices often reflect a promising outlook long before expected profits materialize. With AI adoption poised to go mainstream in the coming year, now is the time to stake your claim. Below is a brief overview of the state of AI, followed by a list of six AI stocks that look promising for 2025. A McKinsey report characterizes 2023 as the year "the world discovered generative AI (gen AI)." 2024 is when businesses began realizing value from using gen AI. The rising adoption has sparked extreme demand for AI-capable computing power. Data centers, in turn, invested billions in hardware and software for powering, developing and training AI applications. In 2025, companies like OpenAI will look to move AI's capabilities into increasingly complex tasks. Use cases for AI will expand across industries and into the personal computing space. Organizations that have invested in AI will attempt to quantify the business value of those investments. How those business value questions resolve will influence the S&P 500. Stephen Wu, founding and managing partner of Carthage Capital Management, notes that nearly half of the S&P 500 is concentrated in tech stocks. "With AI expectations running high," Wu explains, "it's crucial for AI to continue meeting expectations or there may be severe consequences." Spending on AI infrastructure will likely continue, but the pace and focus of that spending may change. TechInsights predicts a greater emphasis on cost efficiency over performance. This will pressure the dominant hardware providers to evolve to meet those changing priorities.

Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days. To capitalize on the trends, I sought out the best artificial intelligence stocks with acceptable valuations, profitable business models, positive outlooks and healthy debt levels. These are the screening criteria: Only two stocks on this list have PE ratios above 40: Nvidia (NVDA) and Synopsys (SNPS). The higher valuation is an acceptable trade-off, given that these are also the only two stocks in the group with gross margins above 70%. The table below introduces the six largest AI stocks that meet the five criteria noted. Table data source: Stockanalysis.com. Now, let's explore each of these AI companies in more detail. Nvidia designs and sells high-performance semiconductors and related hardware and software. The company's hardware is used in AI-capable data centers, gaming applications, robotics and automotive applications. For the last year, Nvidia has been showing the world what's possible in terms of monetizing AI. Leveraging its reputation and the extreme demand for AI-capable chips, Nvidia has nearly tripled its enterprise value to become one of the few $3 trillion companies in the world. Nvidia's expertise and AI positioning are unrivaled. The question for investors is whether the growth opportunity is already built into NVDA's share price. The company's PE ratio is on the high side, but NVDA also has the highest EPS growth outlook and the second-highest gross margin among the stocks on this list. While the greatest gain potential for NVDA may have passed, the stock still has room to run. Taiwan Semiconductor makes semiconductors and related devices on contract for customers. The company has fabrication facilities in Taiwan, China, Japan and the U.S. TSM is the world's leading semiconductor foundry with an estimated market share of 61%, according to Statista. The closest competitor is Samsung, with 11% market share. TSM customers include leading chip designers that outsource manufacturing, such as Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom. TSM has a long track record of performance and growth, built on technological expertise. The well-managed company is also critical to the AI infrastructure buildout. While Nvidia, Apple and AMD are designing the chips that will power the AI revolution, TSM is making them.

Photolithography uses light to transfer a pattern to another surface. The process is used with silicon wafers to make semiconductors. ASML is the dominant market share leader in photolithography machines for semiconductors. The company has long-term relationships with major chip foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel and Samsung. Those foundries cannot easily switch to another provider since a tooling change would require expensive downtime. ASML stock hit a high point in July 2024 and then fell 35%. Investors got nervous when the company announced a conservative guidance for next year. The dip creates a nice buying opportunity for a company that will be essential to semiconductor manufacturing for the foreseeable future. Synopsys makes electronic design automation (EDA) software that supports the design, manufacture and testing of integrated circuits. Customers span several verticals, including automotive and semiconductor design. Synopsys has been a high-performing stock for years. Morningstar quantifies its 15-year total return at 23.7%, which outperforms peers in the software infrastructure industry. The track record of performance is comforting, but it looks even better alongside Synopsys' current positioning. The company's product suite will support the AI revolution directly by enabling ongoing innovation in integrated circuit design and manufacturing. Synopsys is also in the process of acquiring engineering simulation provider Ansys (ANSS). The merger will expand Synopsys' market position and be accretive to revenue and earnings in 2025. Teradyne makes automated test equipment for semiconductors, electronic systems and wireless devices. The company also offers robotics equipment and technology. Morningstar categorizes Teradyne as a wide-moat company, meaning it has a significant and enduring competitive advantage. The heart of that advantage is Teradyne's expertise in testing high-performance semiconductors, which is largely unmatched by competitors. The company's testing solutions will be essential as semiconductors evolve to meet the performance and efficiency needs of more mature AI applications. In its third-quarter earnings release, Teradyne reported guidance-beating EPS—citing AI demand as a factor. Teradyne also offers investors revenue diversification, strong margins and good financial discipline. Since 2020, the company has reduced its debt by more than $500 million. Shutterstock licenses third-party graphics and images to corporations, broadcast companies, small and medium-sized businesses and individuals. Shutterstock recently completed the acquisition of competitor Envato. Envato expands Shutterstock's offering with a subscription for unlimited downloads—formerly a gap in the SSTK's product suite. The company is also seeing organic momentum, with improvements in content performance and growth in its Data, Distribution, and Services segment. As of the third-quarter earnings release, Shutterstock's data business had grown 40% year to date. This is how Shutterstock benefits from the AI buildout. The company currently has about two dozen deals licensing its content to train generative AI tools. As of August 2024, those deals were cumulatively worth $238 million. AI will be a driving force in the financial markets in 2025. Well-run, high-margin, adaptable businesses that support the development, training and deployment of AI applications are well-positioned for growth as the technology evolves.

The company's hardware is used in AI-capable data centers, gaming applications, robotics and automotive applications. For the last year, Nvidia has been showing the world what's possible in terms of monetizing AI. Leveraging its reputation and the extreme demand for AI-capable chips, Nvidia has nearly tripled its enterprise value to become one of the few $3 trillion companies in the world. Nvidia's expertise and AI positioning are unrivaled. The question for investors is whether the growth opportunity is already built into NVDA's share price. The company's PE ratio is on the high side, but NVDA also has the highest EPS growth outlook and the second-highest gross margin among the stocks on this list. While the greatest gain potential for NVDA may have passed, the stock still has room to run. Taiwan Semiconductor makes semiconductors and related devices on contract for customers. The company has fabrication facilities in Taiwan, China, Japan and the U.S. TSM is the world's leading semiconductor foundry with an estimated market share of 61%, according to Statista. The closest competitor is Samsung, with 11% market share. TSM customers include leading chip designers that outsource manufacturing, such as Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom. TSM has a long track record of performance and growth, built on technological expertise. The well-managed company is also critical to the AI infrastructure buildout. While Nvidia, Apple and AMD are designing the chips that will power the AI revolution, TSM is making them.

Photolithography uses light to transfer a pattern to another surface. The process is used with silicon wafers to make semiconductors. ASML is the dominant market share leader in photolithography machines for semiconductors. The company has long-term relationships with major chip foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel and Samsung. Those foundries cannot easily switch to another provider since a tooling change would require expensive downtime. ASML stock hit a high point in July 2024 and then fell 35%. Investors got nervous when the company announced a conservative guidance for next year. The dip creates a nice buying opportunity for a company that will be essential to semiconductor manufacturing for the foreseeable future. Synopsys makes electronic design automation (EDA) software that supports the design, manufacture and testing of integrated circuits. Customers span several verticals, including automotive and semiconductor design. Synopsys has been a high-performing stock for years. Morningstar quantifies its 15-year total return at 23.7%, which outperforms peers in the software infrastructure industry. The track record of performance is comforting, but it looks even better alongside Synopsys' current positioning. The company's product suite will support the AI revolution directly by enabling ongoing innovation in integrated circuit design and manufacturing. Synopsys is also in the process of acquiring engineering simulation provider Ansys (ANSS). The merger will expand Synopsys' market position and be accretive to revenue and earnings in 2025. Teradyne makes automated test equipment for semiconductors, electronic systems and wireless devices. The company also offers robotics equipment and technology. Morningstar categorizes Teradyne as a wide-moat company, meaning it has a significant and enduring competitive advantage. The heart of that advantage is Teradyne's expertise in testing high-performance semiconductors, which is largely unmatched by competitors. The company's testing solutions will be essential as semiconductors evolve to meet the performance and efficiency needs of more mature AI applications. In its third-quarter earnings release, Teradyne reported guidance-beating EPS—citing AI demand as a factor. Teradyne also offers investors revenue diversification, strong margins and good financial discipline. Since 2020, the company has reduced its debt by more than $500 million. Shutterstock licenses third-party graphics and images to corporations, broadcast companies, small and medium-sized businesses and individuals. Shutterstock recently completed the acquisition of competitor Envato. Envato expands Shutterstock's offering with a subscription for unlimited downloads—formerly a gap in the SSTK's product suite. The company is also seeing organic momentum, with improvements in content performance and growth in its Data, Distribution, and Services segment. As of the third-quarter earnings release, Shutterstock's data business had grown 40% year to date. This is how Shutterstock benefits from the AI buildout. The company currently has about two dozen deals licensing its content to train generative AI tools. As of August 2024, those deals were cumulatively worth $238 million. AI will be a driving force in the financial markets in 2025. Well-run, high-margin, adaptable businesses that support the development, training and deployment of AI applications are well-positioned for growth as the technology evolves.

The latest rally was spurred by Broadcom's better-than-expected earnings report late Thursday, and an uplifting outlook for the first quarter. Broadcom, which sells semiconductors and infrastructure software, is seeing soaring demand from the boom in generative artificial intelligence and reported a 220% jump in AI revenue for the year to $12.2 billion. Goldman Sachs analysts, who recommend buying Broadcom shares, lifted their 12-month target to $240 from $190, citing additional large customers for custom silicon. They also referenced management's execution following the $61 billion purchase of VMware, which closed last year. "We now have even higher conviction on the company's forward revenue and earnings growth outlook," the analysts wrote in a report dated Dec. 15. Barclays raised its priced target on the stock to $205 from $200, while Truist raised its call to $260 from $245. Broadcom shares are now up 126% for the year, closing at $250 on Monday. Nvidia, which has been the primary beneficiary of the AI craze due to the popularity of its graphics processing units, or GPUs, is up more than 165% this year, reaching a market cap of $3.2 trillion. The Nasdaq has gained 34%. Broadcom refers to its custom AI accelerators as XPUs, which are different than the GPUs Nvidia sells. Broadcom said it doubled shipments of XPUs in the quarter to "our three hyperscale customers." The company does not name the customers, but analysts say the three are Meta, Alphabet and TikTok parent ByteDance.

Title: Here Is How MicroStrategy Could Qualify For An Inclusion In The S&P 500 Index In 2025

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. As a levered bet on Bitcoin, which itself is one of the most volatile assets to ever exist, MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares are in the limelight these days, with investors and analysts alike honing in on the company's ever-increasing BTC holdings, which then serve to precipitate a circular "tail wags the dog" effect on the price of the world's preeminent cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 46.4% QTD and 72.4% YTD. As of 12/15/2024, we hodl 439,000 $BTC acquired for ~$27.1 billion at ~$61,725 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/SaWLNBVkrl — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 16, 2024 In what has, by now, become a fairly predictable pattern, MicroStrategy announced on Monday that it again increased its Bitcoin holdings last week, spending ~$1.5 billion to acquire 15,350 BTC, which increases the size of its total holdings to 439,000 BTC. MicroStrategy's ever-increasing Bitcoin stash in an overall bullish crypto market could unlock a significant milestone for the company in 2025, courtesy of a recent accounting change spearheaded by the FASB. To wit, the FASB's Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 23-08, which went into effect on the 15th of December 2024, posits that entities holding crypto assets must use the fair value (market-based) approach to revalue those assets for each reporting period, with the resulting gains and losses incorporated within the net income for the pertinent period. This means that, in an environment where Bitcoin's price continues to increase in a consistent fashion, MicroStrategy is likely to record significant quarterly gains. BREAKING: Bitcoin hits $107,000, a new all time high. — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) December 16, 2024 As of the time of writing, Bitcoin has notched another all-time high of $107,000, precipitated by expectations that President-elect Trump will approve a strategic Bitcoin reserve on his very first day in office. Beyond these extrinsic factors, BlackRock recently recommended an optimal multi-asset portfolio allocation of between 1 and 2 percent to Bitcoin. For context, global reserve assets are currently valued at ~$900 trillion. A theoretical 2 percent allocation to Bitcoin can easily boost the cryptocurrency's price to $900,000. The only requirement left for $MSTR to enter the S&P 500 is to have positive earnings over the SUM of the previous 4 quarters. On a theoretical basis once FASB is implemented in Q1 2025 and with a $BTC price of $120,000 and no increase to their $BTC holdings, $MSTR will have… pic.twitter.com/4LJUCweADU — James Van Straten (@btcjvs) December 15, 2024 This brings us to the crux of the matter. For MicroStrategy shares to qualify for an inclusion in the S&P 500 index, the company has to show positive earnings on a cumulative basis for a period that covers the previous 4 quarters. MSTR has yet to satisfy this significant requirement. However, with ASU 23-08 in effect now, and paired with an environment where Bitcoin's price continues to increase, MicroStrategy can show a net income of $25 billion for Q1 2025, which should qualify it for the inclusion in the S&P 500 index, assuming an average Bitcoin price of $120,000 for the period and no additional significant BTC purchases. Bear in mind that the high-flying stock has now been added to the Nasdaq 100 index, unlocking significant passive inflows. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: BlackRock Identifies 1% to 2% as Optimal Bitcoin Allocation
URL: https://www.ai-cio.com/news/blackrock-identifies-1-to-2-as-optimal-bitcoin-allocation/
Time Published: 2024-12-16T17:30:50Z
Full Content:
If an institutional investor wants to incorporate bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio, what is an appropriate allocation? A white paper from the BlackRock Investment Institute, “Sizing bitcoin in portfolios,” identifies a 1% to 2% allocation to bitcoin as reasonable. Any higher, and bitcoin would account for too much risk. The paper stated that a 1% to 2% allocation to bitcoin lifts the digital currency’s share of portfolio risk to 2% to 5%, in line with the average “Magnificent Seven” tech stock, which contributes approximately 4% of portfolio risk, based on current index weights. As bitcoin’s allocation in a portfolio increases, its estimated contribution to risk becomes outsized, compared with those large-cap tech stocks. For example, a 4% allocation to bitcoin would account for 14% of portfolio risk, according to the paper. Therefore, the white paper stated that an allocation to bitcoin of less than 2% would introduce a different source of return and risk, while managing risk exposure. The paper’s authors—Samara Cohen, BlackRock’s CIO of exchange-traded-fund and index investments; Paul Henderson, a senior portfolio strategist; Robert Mitchnick, head of digital assets; and Vivek Paul, global head of portfolio research—wrote that bitcoin cannot be compared to traditional assets and that the main driver of the price of bitcoin will be an increase in adoption. Bitcoin is less correlated with major risk assets in the long term, with a very low correlation between bitcoin and equity returns, the authors wrote. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert daily newsletter.  Institutional ownership of bitcoin could possibly dampen the asset’s volatility, but mass adoption could also dampen future returns, according to the paper. “Broad adoption could also mean bitcoin loses the structural catalyst for further sizable price rises,” the paper stated. “The case for a permanent holding may then be less clear-cut and investors may prefer to use it tactically to hedge against specific risks, similar to gold.” BlackRock noted the high volatility of the asset. Since 2015, there have been six times when bitcoin saw a drawdown of more than 70% from its previous high, including twice—in 2015 and 2019—when the asset had a drawdown of more than 80%. “Taking all this into account, we do see a case for including bitcoin in multi-asset portfolios—provided you believe it will become more widely adopted in the future and are comfortable bearing the risk of potentially rapid price plunges,” the paper stated. Bitcoin is becoming easier to own; several firms, including BlackRock, have launched ETFs which track the price of bitcoin. These bitcoin ETFs have seen $10 billion in inflows since the U.S. election on November 5, according to data from Bloomberg. In total, more than $100 billion has flowed into these ETFs, according to the white paper. Some asset owners have included bitcoin ETFs in their portfolio, including the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which allocated $160 million to two such ETFs, one from Grayscale and one from BlackRock.

Title: Introduction to Bitcoin Transcript

Time Published: 2024-12-16T17:04:32Z

So the Bitcoin revolution, the revolution will be televised. So, starting off. First, what is Bitcoin? Why does it matter? So I think the 1st important critical thing is trying to consider and think you know what is Bitcoin we’ve all heard about in the news we heard about Bitcoin as being a Ponzi scheme, a pyramid scheme. And honestly, my mom has gone through her fair share of Ponzi schemes like she she got suckered by the whole Amway scam. I think the reason why Bitcoin is so important and critical is, Bitcoin is like the early days of the Internet. So if you go into a time machine and you could tell somebody in the past, okay, you know, in the days before email existed. Right? So okay, once one day, you know, everyone’s gonna have a supercomputer in their pocket. They’re using it to check all their bank statements. You’re going to be able to use your camera on your phone to scan your you know your checks, your bank account balances. You can use this to send money and messages and videos to everyone on the planet. Instantly everyone would have thought you were crazy.and I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin. So a constructive way of thinking about bitcoin is trying to figure out what bitcoin is not. ￼My personal opinion is, I do not think that Bitcoin is actually cryptocurrency. I think currency is the Us. Dollar, and I think one of the biggest problems about the whole field of crypto and cryptocurrency is everyone is like a crypto anarchist, which means that they want to see the Us. Government and all the governments on the planet fail, and they can essentially live in peace and silent without interference from the Government. Yet, you know, obviously, at the end of the day, it’s nice to have public streets. It’s nice to not get robbed in the streets. And actually, I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin is. People think that Bitcoin is trying to replace the Us. Dollar. But my personal thought is, Bitcoin is going to be a supplement to the Us. Dollar. Essentially, I thought this a long time ago that essentially Bitcoin is digital gold to hedge against inflation, which means, as our money, our Us. Dollars, or our euros, or our local currencies become devalued. The upside is, our Bitcoin will become more valuable. I think the best analogy that I got was from chairman of microstrategy mstr Michael saylor, essentially thinking that Bitcoin is is not digital currency, but digitalreal estate. So I think this analogy is better, because nobody’s on their zillow, you know, 20 times a day, checking their home prices right? And this is my mad Max Post Apocalyptic perspective. So imagine the future where there’s, you know, essentiallythere’s this like nuclear fallout. And you know.there’s no inhabitable places anywhere. And let us say, there’s only 21 million single family homes left on the planet for anybody to live. Obviously, sooner or later, you know, people are going to want somewhere to live. And so I think the best analogy, I think, is Bitcoin as digital real estate, which means that with digital real estate. You know, a lot of people are like– I want to quickly make money off of Bitcoin. But how do I make money off of it? It’s kind of like the early days of real estate. So if you bought Manhattan in the 1600s, you know, how do you monetize it? And I still think that we’re in the very, very early days of bitcoin and institutional adoption, which means you’re going to start to see New Bitcoin products come out. So some simple thoughts. So we’ve all heard stories of Scumbag San Francisco based scumbag landlords, you know, charging an arm and a leg for their tenants, and we all hate the landlords, I think with Bitcoin we’ll become the new digital landlords, which means effectively, we will in the future be able to like rent out our Bitcoin. And you know, let’s say we have one bitcoin right, and it’s and then I think that the personal math I like to do in my head is thinking that one Bitcoin is equivalent to one single family home. So I currently live in Los Angeles, in Culver City. It’s kind of insane. A single family home. I’ve even seen some in my neighborhood for 4.4 million dollars. The average Median household single family home is around 1.7 million dollars. So in my personal mind, where I think Bitcoin is a trillion times more valuable than physical real estate land, because you could always make more of it. It’s not a real scarcity. A single family home, and the price of a Bitcoin should be pegged to another. So in my mind I still think of a Bitcoin at least 1.11.7 2.1, maybe even 4.4 million dollars a coin. And I think this is a very very fascinating idea, because also, you know, people say, Oh, but Bitcoin is not real. Money is yeah, but like our dead, shiny rocks. Aka. Gold money either, or is fiat currency, you know pieces of paper. You cannot eat pieces of paper to to live. And I think one of the most interesting things I learned about the philosophy of money is that essentially all money is just existing in the minds and souls of men, the value for men, is all essentially subjective. Money is not “real”, but subjective. Now, what makes Bitcoin so fascinating to me is that it’s the 1st time in human existence, you had a hard cap supply of money. So, for example, people often talk about gold, right? So the issue with gold is at the time it was the least bad form of money, because it was very, very scarce. It was difficult to find. It’s difficult to mine and transport. Yet there was lots of good properties of gold. It’s, you know, essentially it kind of lasts forever. Aesthetically, it looks beautiful, the nice yellow color of gold mimics that of the sun, and you know, at least back in the day, let’s say you had gold coins it could easily fit in your front pocket whatevers. But now things become a lot more difficult because we’re living in the 21st century, the 22nd century you know, we would have flying car drone robo taxi, self driving car waymos. It’s like, Why are we still using an antiquated digital framework of modern day banking swift code accounts? If you’ve ever tried to send money, you know, from the Netherlands to South Korea, to Nigeria, to Lagos whatever you find that the the whole SWIFT system is kind of like a bunch of gangster mafiosas like even my mom is currently living in South Korea. Example if I want to just send my mom a small sum of money, it is insane, ￼ it takes like three or four days, and the wire transfer fees like 55 bucks, I hate this. This should be done instantly. Therefore the thought of bitcoin, being able to quickly and effectively and securely transfer value across time and space without a trusted intermediary is a big big deal, a big big revolution. So why does Bitcoin matter? It’s kind of like asking somebody why does clean water matter so one of the things I love about Michael Saylor, and I highly recommend watching all of his videos. @wsaylor. It’s essentially Twitter or X or michael.com. He uses this analogy of sewer water. So let us say, every all 8 billion people on the planet are all drinking sewer water, and people are dying of dysentery, and people are saying, I don’t get it, you know I exercise, you know. Iyou know I eat healthy exercise every day, but I’m still dying of dysentery. My kids are dying of dysentery, and so the whole issue is that if you’re drinking sewer water, no matter how healthy your lifestyle is, how virtuous you is. It don’t matter. You’re going to be, you know, dying of dysentery, or perpetually sick. And so, if we think about these physiological terms, and apply it to Bitcoin and money and digital capital. This becomes really fascinating because my personal thought and you know, also, I grew up in a family of poverty, poverty, meaning that I thought I was going to be homeless at least 2 or 3 times. My dad was perpetually addicted to gambling with the rent money. So what a lot of people don’t understand about growing up in poverty, and prosody is that the logical strategy that you never know when your dad is going to steal your money and gamble it away, and therefore the smart strategy is actually to spend it all right now! Because you never know when he’s going to look in your piggy bank, your personal checking account that your mom put away for your college, or even take your hard earned $3000 as a 15-year-old bus boy at your mom sushi restaurant, lying that you’re going to invest in some business, leaving to LA for about a month, gambling it away, and coming back empty. When I think about it, this is actually super sad. Once again when I was like super super young like two years old, my mom tried to make me a savings account, like one of those checking or savings investing accounts for kids, and she might’ve had a nominal amount of money in it, like 200 or 250 bucks or something. And she told me the sad news is that one day when she checked up on it she discovered that the money was gone. Essentially my dad even stole away that $250 from my child savings account for college, once again feed his gambling addiction. So once again, as a kid growing up, I never had this ethos or tactic of saving. Because we literally cannot come every dime that my mom made was fun into paying for groceries and rent. Therefore I like a 15-year-old kid, my thought was I’m going to take every single penny, I can immediately go out buying some new sneakers, you know, buy some cool clothes, and I literally had $0 in my bank account. So I think the pernicious, vicious cycle of inflation is. You cannot blame people for not saving up capital for their future if the money itself is deflating at such a rapid pace, and so I personally think that you know Bitcoin is like giving every single person on the planet like unlimited free Fiji water, or the best alkaline hipster water whatever water you want. Essentially giving people clean water. Anda lot of people say, Yeah, but Bitcoin is not real money. It’s a okay. So I think this is a big this is a big shift for me also, personally. My personal thought is, Bitcoin is actually more important than money. So we should not think about money. We should think about capital. I think capital is a lot more robust and strong as a concept. So, for example, capital comes from Cap CAP. Like upon your head. K-ap. Essentially it came from the head of oxen. So if you read the Iliad, the Odyssey essentially, every time you want to appease the gods, you have to sacrifice a hectacomb, Hecta means 100 a hundred head of oxen to appease the gods. And you know, obviously, that’s very expensive, like, can you imagine, if you know you sacrificed a hundred Lamborghinis to appease the gods, it would be quite expensive endeavor. Right? And so, capital. We all live under Capitalism — it doesn’t matter if you’re living in Europe, Africa, Asia, America, China, and also one thing that people don’t understand is, I think, what a lot of these people, maybe 4 or 5 years ago, China is going to take over. China’s not going to take over. China is dependent on America, and effectively, the Chinese Yuan the CNY is essentially effectively pegged to the Us. Dollar and the Us. The US is essentially the world. Reserve currency and capital is what we seek, not money. Talking about currency, so currency is like, you know, buying a Starbucks Frappuccino, or buying a in and out Burger. Right? That’s like money currency, right? Capital is essentially long storm, long term, store of value. So it’s building generational wealth. So one of my favorite songs from Kanye West is the off the grid songs that we off the grid grid grid this for my kid, kids, for when my kids, kids have kids. And I think this is also the big thing is a lot of millennials, nowadays, I think the disincentive to have kids is because there’s so much fear mongering about the the future is gonna become uninhabitable, you know boil the seas or whatever. So there’s not going to be a future. So essentially, there’s a strong sense of pessimism. But Bitcoin, to me is like solidified optimism, which means that the future is going to be glorious and great. And you know, even having Seneca right now, think about his future kids, kids, kids, or my future kids, kids, kids.It brings me so much joy. Because the simple strategy, you just keep stacking Bitcoin until you die, and then you hand it on to your kids. Your kids give it to their kids kids. It’s like, if you owned, you know, a hundred penthouses or 10 square blocks or 20 square blocks in Manhattan, on the main island. Do you ever sell that to buy a Lamborghini? No! That’s not what one does, or liquefy it all into us dollars and brag about how many billions of dollars you have in your bank account. Nope, that’s not the goal– you want to build capital. And traditionally it’s been real estate. But once again, real estate was a good idea. In the 16 hundreds, 17 hundreds, 18 hundreds, 19 hundreds, or 2000s. But then the subprime mortgage meltdown proved that, you know maybe it’s not always the best idea. Real estate can go down. And I think the hard thing is, people say, Yeah, but you know, real estate, you know, essentially, everyone needs somewhere to live, and it’s historically, the value of real estate is always going to go up forever. Now people say that the tricky thing is the pace of monetary inflation is around 15%. The best thing is to either chat Gpt or Google The M2 Money Supply. And essentially what you will find isthat the money supply is essentially a metric in which the Us. Government, or any other government on the planet, includes the euro and stuff. They keep printing more currency. And the reason why then this becomes an issue is that if you have more currency in the system that means the individual value of each unit is going to go down. I call this the shake Shack Burger incident. So me and Seneca we used to always buy a single burger, patty, for $1.49, $1.50 … and one day we come and they say no it is $2.50, a party. Why this makes no sense is like, yeah, we just increased the minimum wage to $20 an hour from $15 an hour. $20 an hour for fast food, and the hard thing is with minimum wage. You cannot rewind the the hands of time. If you suddenly said that the minimum wage is only $17 an hour, there will be riots. The streets would not be not be good. So we’re all photographers, you know, street photographers, whatever. And the hard thing with digital is in our minds, digital is infinite and free. So, for example, I could take a copy of Mozart’s 5th Symphony, or whatever, as an mp3, file, and I could copy and distribute it a trillion times with 0 marginal cost right? So this is where the notion of cyber becomes more interesting. And I’ll think about like, you know, cyber punk thinking about cyber truck. It’s essentially once again, mathematically, cryptographically, that the hard science and the hard math is there can never be more than 21 million coinsin existence come up forever. Even if you took all the quantum ultra computers on the planet, times it by 20, you still could not produce more bitcoins. It’s just how it works right? One Bitcoin is like one cyber-ox, and it’s immortable, immortal, indestructible. It’ll give you life forever. And there’s only gonna be 21 million of them in the future. And now and so this is your chance to get one for an extreme discount. Let’s even say let’s say you want to buy a single family home. Let’s say it costs a million euros or whatever. Right? So if I could tell you today that you could buy a single family home for only $100,000 or €100,000 you’d be like, wow, that’s that’s the deal of a century. That’s you’re still getting a 90% discount. And my personal thought is Bitcoin is far more valuable than real estate, because in the next 20-30 years, when essentially all the all the baby boomers, The Gen. Xers die off, and it’s the millennials and Gen. Z’s. And, alphas! When we millennials take over, what’s interesting is that we don’t really care about physical real estate anymore. We will care about digital cyber real estate which is bitcoin. ￼￼ So my personal story, how did I get into Bitcoin? So it might seem a little bit random. It’s like, Okay, ERIC, you’re super famous for photography, street photography like, how do you get to Bitcoin like? It’s like, so random, right? But actually, it’s not very random at all, because, you know, if you’ve been following me carefully, you know the whole time, I’ve always been talking about living minimalistically, frugally, Spartan lifestyle, whatever’s. And you know now that you know I’m pretty stacked with a bitcoin and microstrategy stock mstr. Funny enough, I’ve personally found that my lifestyle habits haven’t changed much after getting super rich, I mean, I’m a little bit more generous, maybe, like, you know, took out a friend last night to all you eat Korean barbecuepaid for her bill didn’t really even flinch. Even a random aside, my best friend and my best man Justin, told me this when we were like in our early 20s, when we finally got good paying jobs whatever, is that the greatest joy is being able to eat out and not really feel the pain associated with having to eat out because we both grew up poor. ￼ I still remember even when I was undergraduate at UCLA, after our KYRIE club meeting, we would all go out to eat, and then I would see all the other guys ordering these really expensive $15 Korean barbecue gogi plates, (this was in 2006, when you could still buy a foot-long sub sandwich for five bucks￼), and $1.99 tacos, and $1 tacos, and me trying to save money, would force myself not to eat even though I was hungry, and my friends would ask me if I was hungry and I would lie, and say I wasn’t, while my stomach was still grumbling. ￼ So my personal thought with Bitcoin is, I personally wanted monetary freedom, and so long story short, so I’ll never forget this moment. So I’m born 1988. Went to UCLA as an undergrad — my roommate at the time, Kevin. It’s our junior he’s on Reddit, and I’ll never forget we’re in our studio apartment. I think I was distracted. I was doing something else. He was like Eric, you know. He’s on some subreddit, and he’s like. “Oh, Eric, this thing called Bitcoin, and there’s this one dude who just bought two domino’s pizzas for like 10,000 bitcoins. We should just get like a hundred bucks worth of bitcoin, and just see what happens.” I then responded “￼Eh, seems like a scam” and disregarded it. No this is one bitcoin was like less than a penny, so even if me and Kevin and my roommate Kevin, just bought a hundred bitcoins at the time for funsies, right? And I had a hundred bucks right? We would each be worth at least 1.2 billion dollars. If I had bought $100 worth of bitcoin at the time, once again we would each have about $1.2 billion in our checking accounts. Today, I’m like, man. This was like the worst mistake of my life, right? But everything has happened as it should have happened. You know. Maybe if I had become a billionaire I’d just become some degenerate, you know. Cocaine addict on some beach somewhere in in Hawaii, and then Seneca would never been born. I would have never done my photography, world travels, whatevers. Then my reintroduction to Bitcoin was kind of more recently when moving to LA. The cost of living is so expensive, and you know every I don’t know a single person who doesn’t want financial freedom. A long story short, I 1st heard about Bitcoin again, kind of earlier than when I was living in Vietnam around 2017, 2018, and at the time I didn’t really need Bitcoin, because our living expenses were so cheap. It was $320 bucks a month for a brand new studio apartment, fully furnished up, uplighting and the jazz right? And even at the time, passively, the income we’re making. Let’s say it’s a $1000- $2,000 a month. Let’s say it’s not even that much right, but like our whole total expenses, living expenses like maybe $600-700 a month, so I had the epiphany I’m like, I’m never going to run out of money. So already, at the age of 26 in my mind, I mentally retired rightand just more for funsies. I met this guy named Bing in Singapore. Heard about this thing called Digibyte. Dgb, I don’t even think they’re around anymore. But at the time I’m like, Okay, I want to buy some bitcoins, buy some digibyte. How do I do this? And at the time Coinbase seemed like the best option, because it was the simplest, most minimalist to me it looked like the paypal for for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. For fun I bought about $25,000 worth of bitcoin, which, and Bitcoin was only about $7,000, $6,999 a bitcoin. So that was around 3.5 bitcoins. ￼ I then traded some bitcoin for digibyte, and I kept some bitcoin in my Coinbase account. Then the next few years I essentially saw the waves and the crashes and the dogecoins and stuff like that. And essentially, I just kind of woke up to my guts and found out that Bitcoin was a real deal. Some strange analogies is to me Bitcoin is almost like a newWorld economic religion, I mean, people who follow Bitcoin are like fanatic. They’re zealous about it. They follow Michael Saylor like he’s like you know the prophet. You know the next prophet of Bitcoin right? And it’s always good to invest in religions or to invest in cults like the cult of Tesla, Elon Musk apple, Steve Jobs. Whatevs, right? Now obviously, I have financial independence now, and the only reason I’m teaching this workshop or sharing this information is, I almost feel like it’s my ethical imperative. Once again, if you could have discovered internet in the early days, or clean drinking water, I would feel that it would almost be a disservice if I did not share this information with others. So everyone’s always about like, okay, so what is the Bitcoin gonna be worth? So there’s the open source model. Michael Saylor, I think, helped create it. It’s called the Bitcoin 21 model, I think. Right? So 21 years from now his base case is that Bitcoin is going to be $13 million a Bitcoin. Bear case, $3 million a Bitcoin. The bull case is $49 million a Bitcoin, and note, this was in 2024 in July before Trump was announced as President, and he is ultra super pro crypto and bitcoin and also worth following, is his son Eric Trump, ironically. His name is also Eric also the funny thing. There’s a bunch of Eric’s actually in the world of Bitcoin, Eric Kim Eric Semler, of semler scientific, this other Etf guy who works for Bloomberg. His name is Eric Balconus, or something like that. Essentially, we have an all Republican trump, pro bitcoin pro crypto, President and cabinet, whatever right? What is really fascinating about Michael Saylor’s predictions for the future price of bitcoin is that when it was only $65,000 a bitcoin, and we were a bit uncertain about what the future of bitcoin and the president and the government would look like. The last four years, we were all fighting an uphill battle, because the former administration was adamantly anti-crypto and anti-bitcoin. Gary Gensler who seems like a smart guy, was for some reason really anti-bitcoin and crypto? ￼￼ And so these were all written by Michael Saylor’s predictions before we had the most pro bitcoingovernment of all time. So all these numbers, I think, should be inflated. So my personal thought is, I think, for the next 4 years once Trump takes office, January 20, 2025. I think this will be the craziest, best Bitcoin Bull Run of all time the next 4 years. So currently, Bitcoin’s been going up around 60% to 62% arr annual rate of return. And I think once Trump takes office, and I’m pretty sure he’s gonna buy the 1 million Bitcoins, or whatever for the strategic American Reserve. And also I think Eric Trump, his son, is committed to having Bitcoin be at least a million in Bitcoin. So let’s see. So my personal prediction, right? So I think Bitcoin will grow by at least 120% arr over the next 4 years. So let’s say, Bitcoin is worth around $100,000 right now. So by next year, let’s say it’s $250,000 the year after that, let’s say it’s $750,000, let’s say the year after that it’s like $1.2 million. So I think we’re on track to hit a million a bitcoin in 4 years about 10x gain. So just do the math from then. Currently as an account measure, I now equate one bitcoin being worth one cyber truck, assuming that a cyber truck is currently around $100,000. So the smart strategy is to take your hundred thousand dollars and invest it into bitcoin today, and you’ll see that becoming $1 million in four years. ￼ What that means is sell your cyber truck for $100,000, buy bitcoin, otherwise you have just done spent $1 million on your cyber loser truck. Now, people are always asking, okay, this, you know, Bitcoin reserve strategy, you know, like, how is? And why is America going to buy the Bitcoins? Right? So we’re essentially out of physical land and real estate. Now we have to go to cyberspace right? And it seems kind of silly, like something out of a sci-fi film. But the truth is, they’re currently the war we’re having with China and Russia. It’s it’s not physical war per se. It’s actually cyber war. So cyber security is the big big money maker. Even cyber penetration testing. Right? I think Gmail is trying to get like all these malicious actors trying to attack the Gmail servers like a million times a minute. Something crazy, right? And if you look at the history of America, right? So, Manhattan, 1600s, the price of Manhattan. It was essentially stolen from the natives. Right? 60 guilders, right Louisiana purchase, you know, to fund Napoleon, California. Also kind of stolen from the the local Mexicans right? And also Alaska right. The the payoff was great, right, and so essentially the Bitcoin Act, the Cynthia Lummis Bill, she’s trying to get the States to buy at least a million bitcoins right? And you know even a Michael Saylor is much more aggressive. He’s like no America should at least purchase maybe 5 or 6 million bitcoins, which is 20 to 25% of the whole Bitcoin supply. And all America has to do is a free trade. They just need to sell their gold and then buy Bitcoin. And in a recent interview that I was listening from Saylor.super fascinating, is like essentially what he said was the super evil genius strategy of America selling her gold reserves and buying Bitcoin is that if that’s the case,we demonetize our enemies. You know, gold capital reserves. So then suddenly, the the gold of the Russians, the Chinese, will go to 0, and then everyone’s going to rush into Bitcoin. And if America owns Bitcoin, it’s a good sign for the future. And also another big thing I want to talk about. Why does America have the best economy on the planet?So we essentially gave birth to Apple Amazon, Facebook, the magnificent 7 stocks, Netflix. And you know, people talk about China. It’s like. Okay, I don’t know a single rich mainland Chinese oligarch who doesn’t want to send their kids to the States to Harvard or Yale or Princeton, you know, buy a nice house in Palo Alto, the Bay area, or even Vancouver. No rich mainland Chinese person actually wants to be in China, but because of capital controls, they’re kind of stuck. So once there’s going to be a mad rush to Bitcoin. That means that you, your family, your whole squad, is going to prosper now. My friend Dante had a question about storage. So I think the hard thing with storage is okay. So how do you say this?This is my personal philosophy. The reason I do not personally trust cold storage for myself or more of these self custody options is that I know that I am very forgetful, and my biggest fear is, let’s say, I forget my passcode, or whatever is right to the Bitcoins. And or let’s say, my kids, kids can forget it right? Then boom like, you’re gonna be out like a hundred 1 million dollars. Right? So that’s that’s not fun, right? And so personally, I think the easiest is to just, you know, store it on the cloud. So, using a trusted custodian, whether it be coinbase. I think fidelity has their own services now. And the you know honestly, it seems like Coinbase is probably the best option,,, coinbase.com, or you just download your iphone ipad. Whatever right is that you could also get a link with your biometric apple id data, whether it be face id or thumbprint. Whatevs right? So this way, it just feels much more secure. So for me, I would prefer an 80 to 85% optimal thing that is kind of dummy proof rather than take the 100% secure option which, because of user error, I might fail, and something that I personally learned is in terms of technology. And all these things in betweenseeking the simplest, most straightforward optionthat is least complicated is often the best solution. And the reason I would be very, very wary of a lot of these people promoting, you know, buying their hardware wallets. Whatever right, everyone has a buck to make. Everyone has a bitcoin to make. Everyone wants to make a few satoshis here and there. So they’re trying to fear monger us. Oh, you’re gonna you know, Coinbase going to get hacked. And I’m like, no, I don’t think it is. It’s like, you know, back. It’s like essentially a Us. Government backed institution, you know, it’s essentially it’s traded on the the the US Stock Exchange. It’s a American based company. I would not trust anything outside of the States. If you’re super, you know, quant genius, autistic genius, then do all the cold storage stuff. But if in doubt, just the simplest thing is, coinbase seems to be the best. Okay, so this is kind of my free money hack. So I call this microstrategy, strategy, mstr microstrategy versus bitcoin. And okay, so it’s very, very simple. So this becomes a philosophical debate. To say it short.I think the ultimate goal is to own Bitcoin, he or she, or the entities which own the most Bitcoin shall win. And so for me, philosophically, you know, let us say that you could own, you know, 20 bitcoins, or you could own 2 million dollars worth of micro strategy. Mstr. Stock. Right?10-20, 30 years from now, right? With MSTR you’re going to actually outperform Bitcoin. You’re actually going to make more money from microstrategy stock than Bitcoin. So Bitcoin, historically, has been 60% to 62% ARR annual rate of return MicroStrategy is almost double that 120 to 125 ARR. So if you actually want to maximize your returns, you just buy microstrategy stock mstr. The issues is, you know let us say that Michael Saylor gets shot. He gets killed. He dies in a Cybertruck self driving accident whatever. Right? Then, it’s probably not going to be the world’s best future for microstrategy. So it’s actually much more risky. If you want the least risky option, just put all your money into Bitcoin. And some millennial living strategies. Right? So the the simplest strategy I have, I call it the Spartan strategy. This is why I personally follow. Is you essentially try to live as minimally and frugally and sparse as you can, and just put literally 90% of your income into bitcoin. And a free money hack I discovered. So, for example, let’s say you have $150,000 or €150,000. Right? And you know I’m not 100% sure how it works if you’re a European. Anyways what you do is you buy microstrategy stock. So let’s say you buy, you know, $100,000 or $150,000 worth of it right? And Mstr, and you use fidelity, or robinhood, or whatever trading app you have. Right. And the strategy is simple. Let us say the base case is $150,000. Let’s say your microstrategy stock value then goes up to $200,000. Right?You sell $50,000 worth of it, and then you just transfer that to your bank account, and then your bank account is linked with your coinbase account. Then you just buy the Bitcoin — rinse and repeat. So very, very impressive over the last 3 months, I started with initial seed capital of around $150,000 in microstrategy stock, off of that $150,000 right and I haven’t even touched my principal. I yielded $242,000off of that initial $150,000. Once again I didn’t touch any of my principal. So essentially I made a free $240,000 dollars … in just 3 months! And also for traditional Roth, Roth, Ira retirement accounts. I put everything into microstrategy stock, and it had already like 3x’d. For example, My roth, Ira, just kind of randomly was like was $78,000, and then the course of 3 months it’s like now, $230,000. It peaked at around $300,000. So it’s going to be a good future. So the the very simple strategy– cut and reduce your expenses to a bare minimum. ￼So let us say you’re able to get down your living expenses to let’s say you know, $5,000 bucks a month or €5,000 a month. Right? the point isn’t to just make a bunch of money and just go out and buy the Lambo. The the goal is actually to continue to live frugally. If anything live more frugally. So the funny paradox here is that when people say they want to become a millionaire, but they’re really mean to say is I want to spend $1 million. ￼ But the funny thing is the second you go out and you spend $1 million, you then become worth zero dollars. So actually, the game then is to stack your capital indefinitely and to see your numbers go up forever. And then the hilarious thing assuming that you’re like some sort of greedy money rich person, you actually continue to live as frugally as possible, and not touch your capital. ￼￼￼ I think one of the wise ways to think about money is like heat loss. For example, if you’re super effing cold, do you want to seal up the window windows and the spots of your house which loses heat. The same thing is with money and capital. You want to stop the capital loss. ￼So for example, the number one thing is the whole vehicle thing!￼ Never ever ever ever ever purchase any vehicle that requires premium gas. This is like the stupidest mistake of all time.￼ You continue driving your old Toyota Prius, and just pour all of your money in Bitcoin, because really the truth is and this is my philosophical thought is, there’s almost nothing worth on the planet purchasing.Besides, Bitcoin is my philosophical thought. The only thing worth purchasing on the planet is bitcoin. ￼ ￼Also some even more super smart economic leverage. Instead of paying an arm and a leg for rent in La or New York. Brooklyn, you just move to like Southeast Asia. So if you move to Southeast Asia, you can live like a king, for like $300-500 bucks a month. Right? You just put all your money to Bitcoin. So even if you had a modest savings, right, let’s say you had like $200,000, and you have microstrategy stock.Let’s say every month of the month is rent is due, and the expenses are due right? You just sell a small portion of that stock, and it’s going to go up. So my thought on the next 4 years, microstrategy, assuming it’s around 2x Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is going to go up 120% ARR. I think microstrategy is going to double that 240% ARR. So just do the math. At the end of every single month in which expenses are due, let us say it’s like $1000 bucks or something… You just sell $1000 worth of bitcoin or microstrategy stock to just afford your lifestyle. ￼ But ultimately my personal thought is whatever excess, money and capital you have just put it onto Bitcoin. So the microstrategy then ends up becoming the engine or the turbocharger or the cash cow. You milk it, and you shave the cream off the top, and then you buy Bitcoin with it. So I think the reason why to me Bitcoin is such a fascinating thing, and very exciting, is essentially Bitcoin is digital photography. Peter Diamandis, the X prize guy. Right? You know, he talks a lot about kodak film. You know the iphone and disruption.So actually, intuitively, as photographers and digital photographers, we should actually understand bitcoin. You know, this disruptive power about digital photography. So obviously, you have the hipsters with their mustaches and their flannels, you know, talking about the virtues of film photography. But the truth is, digital photography is like a quadrillion times better than film photography. And also currently, in the year 2025, incomingdigital photography is actually superior to film photography. In the early days of digital ,,, digital photography sucked. But now, at this point, digital photography is far superior to any sort of film photography, and the only reason you should shoot film in today’s world is either as like a practice to appreciate the joys of photography. So the philosophical approach. Or you know, you’re trying to be some sort of like, you know, snobby fine art photographer and overcharge money for your photos. Then you shoot film.Because honestly, the the fine art market, they’re always going to overvalue film photos over digital photos, because it’s more complicated. It’s more strange, right? So in the art, in the art world, the more complicated, abstruse, and complicated, you can make your art the better. But for us,where we care about practical things, yeah, think about Bitcoin. So think about the iphone iphone pro versus your mom’s kodak Browning camera. I think the the thought is obvious. Okay. Very simple. Just download the coinbase app. Buy Bitcoin. If you don’t want to actually own Bitcoin, you just want to make a ton of money, just buy microstrategy stock MSTR, and use your traditional accounts. And I still think that this is the biggest thing is that everyone wants to become a millionaire, right?But you know what I think people want to do isthey don’t want to earn like, okay, okay.people want to spend a million dollars.They don’t want to actually save and build a million dollars right? And so if you think about, you know, money andcapital digital capital, I think about like Lego bricks, right? I just went to Legoland. Senecall is great. So let us say thateach bitcoin, or dollar or 1 million dollars like these. Let’s say these are Lego bricks right? The goal is, you want to build your Lego Tower brick thing as tall as possible. You don’t ever want toget rid of your bricks and throw into the trash. That’s essentially what consumerism is. And this is actually another big philosophical thing I discovered is, what’s the difference between capitalism and consumerism. Consumerism is actually the exact opposite of capitalism. Capitalism is about accumulating wealth.building your capital and not spend it right. Even one of my favorite Kanye quotes is like why people make money don’t spend it. But I’d rather buy 80 gold chains go ignorant, right ignorant. And so the pernicious thing that happens in a lot of communities, especially poor communities. Right? I’ve seen this happen with my own eyes. Right?Happens to Korean people. It happens to everybody, right? Is that you know you live in a crappy apartment in K. Town with 20 other dudes. Yet you drive the brand new Bmw. And you’re not building any sort of generational wealth. Right? And so essentially, yeah, you want to build the capital and not spend it. And essentially, you want to start to intelligently leverage your capitalto give to your future kids or your descendants, or whatever you want to do. Now, the hardest thing about Bitcoin is stomaching the volatility so volatile, mean. Just it goes up, it goes down, and then, like honestly for most people, it’s going to give them like 5. 100 heart attacks over right nowI think of a Bitcoin kind of like nuclear energy, sonuclear energy in the untamed formed is obviously toxic could cause the next Fukushima whatevers right? But if you have a bunch of smart people, engineers, nuclear physicists working in a controlled manner, right? It’s like the greatest benefit to society, because to humanity, because essentially, you’re giving people free electricity forever. Right? AndI think my personal thought is the volatility is a future not above. So the reason why Bitcoin goes up and down the sideways so much all the time, and you can have huge swingsis because you could trade a 24, 7, 365 on the weekends in the evenings. Right?It still befuddles me that in the year 2024, 2025 like. Why is it that you know, after 5 pm. You know Eastern time, or on the weekend Saturday, Sunday like, why did they close the market? So what if there’s another Cuban missile crisis. It makes no sense right?And also the reason why it’s so volatile is that it’s actually the mostdesirable commodity on the planet. And there’s all these people with these weird Bloomberg machine terminals, whatever they are, always pegging everything to the Bitcoin. So a lot of people ask about ethereum dogecoin webs, right. I think Bitcoin is the only true.Everything else is the false prophets. Everything else is the false coins. The immaculate conception of Bitcoin and Satoshi.I think this is actually a big deal, because anything that is not Bitcoin, you know, ethereum and the like. They they need some sort of spokesperson, or, you know, individual to prop up the value right, whereas Satoshi, he invented it, he disappeared forever. Now the reason why this is such a big deal is thatevery other crypto thing which is not Bitcoin.It does not have a hard caplike you could print more ethereums. You could print more. Whatever tokens you cannot print more bitcoins, and that’s that’s the big thought.So. Volatility is vitality. Eric Kim. I actually didn’t say that. Sorry. That was actually Michael Saylor. I typed that in wrong. But essentiallyyou know, volatility is vitality, and the more volatile the more energy the power you have, the more vitality you have. So once again, people think of volatility as being risk. That is actually not the case. Bitcoin is going to go up forever, but it’s going to be like an extreme roller coaster and go up down, but with extreme swings it’s extreme performance. Soyeah, volatility is not risk. Volatility is just going up and down a lot, but essentially over a long enough time span. It’s going to go up forever.So I borrowed a lot of slides quite liberally from Michael Saylor. Some of these are from his recent Microsoft. Pitch. And yeah, just go. michael.com go to his presentations looking at yourself. So I’ll just make some quick points. Soessentially, currently, Bitcoin is like a 2 trillion dollar asset class right? And this is also from Jesse Myers once in a species.com. And the reason why this is important is currently you know. Let us say the whole world’s economy is 900 trillion dollars, right? Andwhat we have our eyes on is real estate. So real estate is, you know, most people don’t really just use real estate as a place to live right? Otherwise, you just rent. People use it for a long term store of value. So, for example, if you’re a really really rich family from New York City, you own, like 10 square blocks in Manhattan, and, you know, does your descendants sell, you know.a square block to buy himself a few Ferraris. No, that that would be a bad strategy. So the the tip I have for any single person trying to build intergenerational wealth. Keep it simple. Only one rule. You don’t sell the Bitcoin. If you face extreme poverty or financial distress, I don’t know. Become an Uber driver or something. Pay the bills, but don’t sell the Bitcoin.and currently I think we’re going to see is Bitcoin is just going to take over the gold market, which is 16 trillion dollars, maybe the cars and collectible art market.Now, a big thought is this is from Michael Saylor once again, is thatall these assets on the planet.Some of half of it is to provide utility. Right? So, for example, you know.let’s say you need you need somewhere to live right? No so that provides utility right? But then, again, some of it is to preserve capital right? Andas a 36 year old millennial nowadays. The pressures. Oh, you got to buy a single family home today, right? But the the reason I get so sus of people saying you should buy a house is that they’re like, oh, you essentially need somewhere to live. You’ll build capital. Blah! Blah, right? You don’t want to give money to land, but it’s like no, you only need one reason like you would only ever buy a single family house. If let’s say you really like having a backyard and a garage, or what is right. But it’s really nota money making thing, because homeownership is like a trillion, times more expensive than you would otherwise think, and as a consequence, with a single family home, even if the price is going up rightat best, you might be breaking, even if not, you know, slowly bleeding yourself. Because, let’s say, real estate is on average, going up 10% a year, right? The money supply the inflationary. M 2 supply is 15% a year. So you’re actually kind of losing money.So the big thought is once again, you know.the optimistic thought is eventually all these long term sort of things are going to become digital capital. I still think about this, the Warren Buffett. They’re all gonna die. And then, when we, you know, take the take the mantle. What’s gonna happen the next 20 years, even if you’re 80 years old right now? 81 years old. Shout out.You know, I think I’m optimistic. We could live to be 100 20. So yeah, this is definitely the next wave. You’re not going to want to miss right? And you know, currently a lot of millennials. People like everyone wants to buy the Lambo or the Ferrari.You’re you’re going to lose the value of it in about 3 years. You want to live forever.So these are some kind of conservative growth estimates, according to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin 24 model. So in about 21 years, and this was still pretty conservative. Right? Bitcoin is going to become a 280 trillion dollar, you know thing right? So going from 2 trillion to 200 trillion, so at least 10 x. So you’re conservatively, you’re going to see your money at least 10 x in 21 years, which is pretty cool. Right? It’s not going to take over all these other things. It might, but it might not.Now people always ask.what is Bitcoin backed by? So I did the maths right and based on what other people say, too essentially the Bitcoin network. If you took all the apple Amazon aws servers, Meta.combine them all times 20, you could still not hack the Bitcoin network in in terms of the raw power that goes into powering. Think about like 20 nuclear power reactors powering the thing right? And also people don’t understand is there’s already been 850 billion dollars of quote, real money investment thing follow Blackrock. They just recently recommended most of theiryou know, owners to allocate at least 2% of their portfolio into Bitcoin, which is kind of a big deal. Look about what Larry Fink says. Blackrock is like what they own. What 40 trillion dollars of assets around the planet. They’re they’re kind of a big deal. And also it’s a network effect. So you remember, in the early days of Facebook. It was only it was only university students with the Edu address were allowed to join in. Then they opened up to everybody, and the network effect of Facebook is thatif you have Facebook and I have Facebook, then Facebook instantly becomes more valuable to both of us, because I can now share my photos with you, whatever’s right. But then, if your friends friends also have Facebook, it becomes much more valuable to everything. Same thing goes with facetime right. The reason why I got you know I used to be a Diehard android dude. Now I’m like all icloud everything. It makes life so much easier. You get your mom an iphone. Now you get facetime imessage. It makes life way better.And so Bitcoin is going to be the same thing as more and more people are going to continue to download Coinbase or Whatevs. And also my optimistic thought is, if Apple doesn’t want to become irrelevant, it’s I’m very certain the next 5 to 10 years. Apple is going to have their ownBitcoin storage thing in your icloud account. It makes sense right. They have apple pay. They have the apple wallet. Essentially.apple is the new bank. And so now, when they do like a you know, a 3 device authentication for your bitcoins through your iphone, your ipad and your macbook pro whatevers.It’s actually it might actually be one of the most safe ways to store your bitcoins.Also things to think about. If you’re a traditional investorso there’s this notion called the cost to capital cost to capital that Michael Saylor says a lot. I might be getting this wrong. Butessentially the S. And P. 500 right?on average, is like 14 to 15% return year over year. Right? So if you’re not making at least 15% or over 15% a year, you’re essentially losing your bleeding money. So real estate gold bonds is kind of a losing bet, right? And so the magnificent 7 which all the big tech stocks 28%, a little bit better, right? But look at Bitcoin. It’s like 62% year over year. And it’s kind of the obvious bet, right?And even if you think about you know, everyone’s talking about Nvidia Tesla. You know what is right.I think the reason why the mainstream media they don’t like to talk about micro strategy is that it’s still a little bit too weird and bizarre. And it’s not as buzzworthy as AI, because, okay, people like to think of this like evil Terminator AI, the video going to take over the world and find it right. But nobody is like Bitcoin, likeBitcoin is not an android walking around 2 feet, taking over the planet right? So people actually don’t like to talk about Bitcoin. And for so long people thought that Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme right. No one ever thought that AI was a Ponzi scheme. So the video always catches the headlines. But look at microstrates, look at the best performing stock on the human unit in the human universeover 3 x. That of Nvidia, which is already impressive, and Nvidia is already destroying Tesla by a massive margin as well. Right? SoI mean? That’s that’s pretty obvious, right?Even Donald Trump watches a Nashville presentation. He quotes Michael Saylor directly, says, Never sell your Bitcoin. Apparently Eric Trump, the son of Donald Trump has known Michael Saylor for 20 years. I’m not sure if that’s true or not, but if that’s the case.I’m like a hundred percent certain that. You know, Michael Saylor essentially has the left ear of Donald Trump.And yeah, it’s it’s a it’s a very good thing.So if you want to plug and create your own models. Google, the Bitcoin, 24 model. It’s on Githubplug in your own assumptions.And this is the big thing that I have my eyes set on. So currently, you know, it’s December right? And everyone’s waiting for the trump to get into the office January 20.th So this is a tricky thing. So I used to be Super Anti Donald Trump, right? Because I could care less about politics and stuff like that right? Andbutone Donald Trump became super super pro bitcoin. I started to listen and start watching all his interviews and looking like honestly the you know, I’m from the Bay Area like Liberal Democrat, my whole life right? And actually, I kind of realized, wow, the the left leaning media is kind of the they’re kind of the evil ones here. And Donald Trump, he seems actually kind of like a cool, nice nice nice guy, right?And the big thought is.there’s no, there’s not going to be a World war 3. What is right? And Bitcoin, under the trump administration is gonna explode, and it’s gonna be thethe greatest 4 years of prosperity of all time, and this once again coming from like a super left leaning liberal. So this is a good thought so. Anyways. Let us say, you know.America leads the charge in the crypto Bitcoin revolution. Right? And yeah, I thinkassuming that America really wants to control the future. I think the America purchasing 6 million bitcoins is not fully out of this this planet. Right?So some thoughts on building personal family wealth.So the reason why I think this is kind of a big deal is thateveryone wants to build wealth right. Everyone wants to be intelligent with their investing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a nonprofit, a charity, a church, Mother Teresa, like every single organization, will always need money. Capital. If you have an endowment, you know, for Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford Brown University. Whatever even the Uc. Is right, everyone needs money and capital right.and I don’t like to think too much about the macro, because I’m not an institutional investor. I just think about myself, my family, my best friends, my squad. Right? So the goal is building personal family wealth and how to intelligently invest. So a lot of people talk about timings. Oh, when should I buy Bitcoin? Should I time it the high. Then people take out these charts and these candlesticks, which is all just witchcraft and pseudoscience don’t follow any of that.Essentially the thought is.anytime is a good time to buy Bitcoin if it’s high, low, Middle, whatever. We’re going to keep buying the top forever. So recently I bought some more Bitcoin at $100,000. Right then it dipped down to 90,000 to 88,000 hit 103,000 again, and so I’m pretty sure that in 1020 years I’m going to be buying Bitcoin at 1 million, a Bitcoin, 10 million dollars a Bitcoin, 55 million dollars a Bitcoin, whatever is right, and because if you do the simple math, just think at least 4 years ahead, right? So if I could tell you with 100 certainty that Bitcoin is going to be 1.2 million a Bitcoinin 4 yearsas long as you’re buying it for less than a million dollars a coin. You’re going to be in the green like it’s it’s kind of a a good bet, right? And actually, also, ironically, my personal thought ischasing gains is a good thing, but also it’s it’s a good idea to not get quote greedy in the sense of maximizing your gains. So so, for example, right like, what’s the difference between getting a 38% yield and a 32% yield like the the difference is nominal. Don’t don’t worry so much about maximization, because even a lot of what I thought my trades were bad2 years ago ended up being right. So as investors, we have to think at least 410-20-3040 years ahead of us. So don’t worry so much about the the short termso practical and pragmatic investing strategies right? So once again, so if I had a simple blueprint, sosome some simple thoughts.there’s lots of different blends. You could do this, you could. You could be super simple. Just 100 to Bitcoin, buy it on Coinbase what is right, and just keep stacking forever.100 legitimate. That’s the Bitcoin Maximus opposed the triple, triple Maxi, the triple Maximalist approach. If you just need to pay the bills whatever, and still stack the Bitcoins. My personal suggestion is put 80% of your wealth into Bitcoin and 20% of your wealth into micro strategy Mstr stock. And once again. This is this is what you do. So let’s say, for simplicity of math. Let’s sayLet’s say you have a million dollars or a hundred $1,000, or you use whatever kind of a number you want, right? So put 20% that to microstrategy stock whenever it goes upbeyond the principal, sell some of that stock and put that into micro strategies. Sorry. Put that into Bitcoin, and or use that money to just pay your your bills. So once again what I personally did right?$150,000 working capital into micro strategy Mstr stock. And let’s say, when it goes from worth $150,000 to $160,000. I’ll sell $10,000 worth that stock. That $10,000 gets deposited to my checking account, which is linked to my coinbase. Then I’ll just buy $10,000 worth of bitcoin right? Or, if you need that, $10,000for living expenses. Let’s sayyou need $3,000 to pay your rent. You take $3,000 of that to pay your rent, and you put the other 7% of that into Bitcoin.also some other definition. What’s the difference between being an investor, a trader versus speculator?So an investor, we want to be investors. We want to think about (102) 030-4050 years ahead of us. A trader is a bunch of these, like 20 year old. High testosterone degenerates, you know, single, you know, maybe addicted drugs, or whatever right, who just want to like look cool. I made a billion dollars in a month by using all these complicatedstatistical models. Blah! Blah! Right? But you don’t. You don’t want to be a trader because essentially it’snobody could time the market. Not even God could time the market right. And what a speculator is people who invest in meme coins. So a meme coin is like buying a Dogecoin or shiba Inu, that the reason why these are not you should not do this is that it is extremely dangerous. You’re going to lose all your money, and it requiresa charismatic leader to support it. So Dogecoin, right? Dogecoin is essentially elon musk coin right?But if one day Elon musk tweets. Ha! Ha! Doge was just a joke all along, right. It’s not worth anything. The value of it will pump it to 0, or if once again. Elon dies in a you know a robo taxi accident. The value of dogecoin is going to go to 0, whereas if Elon Musk dies, you know Bitcoin is going to still keep going up forever. So speculator is meme coins beyond bitcoin us Bitcoiners. We’re we’re investors.So you know, somebody also asked about, you know, monetary inflation right? So there’s this thing called the M. 2 monetary supply of the the rate rate inflation.And once again you’re going to have to exceed at least 13% to 15% tonot lose money. So, for example, let us say, you have a billion dollars of us dollars in your checking account. Right? You’re going to be bled to death. Right? So in a year, your 1 billion dollar is going to shrink to 750 million down to 500 million, to 350 million. And essentially, you’re going to get a point where your money is worthless.And already we see this right now. So currently, the price of real estate, single family homes is exploding. But this is my critical view. How much of that is that the value of a single family house is higher versus our Us. Dollars are just simply worthless. Right? So if you just do the same simple maths, right?So let us say that. You know, minimum wage goes from $15 an hour to $20 an hour overnight for Mcdonald’s worker. Right? That means instantly. You see, 25% inflation. So your 1 million dollars in the bank is now worth only 750$1,000. So yeah, once again. The real real rich people. They store less than 1% of their wealth inUs. Dollars in their checking account like, you’re not gonna have Jeff Bezos bragging to other people that he has 10 billion dollars of us dollars in their checking account. No, it’s it’s all going to be in you know, stocks, or, you know, real estate. And actually, ideally, Bitcoin. Cyber cyber capital.So yeah, that’s that’s essentially the the end of my presentation. When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy As Marc Norman, associate dean of NYU’s SPS Schack Institute of Real Estate, kicked off the proceedings for Commercial Observer’s second annual Breakthrough Awards Breakfast, he neatly summarized the depth of the challenges faced by all those nominated for these awards — and, for that matter, for all who endeavor to close deals and create new properties in an industry that has been besieged by obstacles in recent years. “The deals nominated today represent for me and our students at Schack an amazing series of case studies in how complex transactions get done in a dynamic political, policy, and economic environment,” said Norman. “The structure of this event is something I love, because it shows us excellence across all asset classes and sectors, deal sizes, and financing types. This crew of finalists represents a kind of best-in-class, and shows us the way in innovating and moving forward in a very tough market — really the toughest market — New York City.” And this, illustrating the resilience and ingenuity at the heart of the industry, is in many ways the primary purpose of the Breakthrough Awards. “Our Commercial Observer Breakthrough Awards have become an important way of recognizing and celebrating the critical deals, transactions, projects and teams that are leading the industry forward despite market challenges,” said Observer Media CEO James Freiman. “In a challenging economic landscape, it’s easy to get distracted by the many hurdles the industry faces, but each of the Breakthrough Award finalists and winners have demonstrated best-in-class work and the innovation and ingenuity needed to overcome those obstacles.” The prestige of these awards had a clear and marked impact on all those nominated. “Knowing that Rosenberg & Estis is recognized along with other top-notch law firms as one of the elite firms representing the real estate industry, in what is a very competitive business and in the world’s most competitive city, is at the same time gratifying and humbling,” said Michael E. Lefkowitz, managing member at Rosenberg & Estis, one of the evening’s nominees for Law Firm of the Year. “These types of industry recognition events are excellent opportunities to showcase Rosenberg & Estis’ talents, and well as to get to know a bit more about the amazing achievements and successes of other players in the real estate industry.” Kicking off the evening’s deals and transactions segment, the night’s first award, for Retail Transaction of the Year, went to Kushner, Fortress Investment Group, GreenBarn Investment Group, and Rithm Capital for their $415 million financing of Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, N.J. The financing will be used to transform the former mall into an open-air town center featuring 900,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space. “I want to thank our partners Fortress and GreenBarn on our amazing Monmouth Square project in Eatontown,” said Kushner CEO Laurent Morali. “And to our amazing team at Kushner, represented here by so many, I love all of you and I love working with all of you. Thank you so much.” Industrial Transaction of the Year was awarded to Turnbridge Equities, Dune and Cushman & Wakefield for Otto Environmental Systems’ 61,000-square-foot lease at 807 Bank Street in Brooklyn. “Biggest thanks to Turnbridge and Dune for their incredible collaboration in bringing this innovative, eco-friendly solution to life,” said Rico Murtha, a managing director at Cushman & Wakefield. “With its forward-thinking design and low carbon footprint, this breakthrough embodies the future of sustainable technology in industrial facilities. We are thrilled for Otto to commence its war on rats in the streets of NYC!” Residential/Multifamily Transaction of the Year, intended to recognize the breakthrough deal or transaction advancing the residential and/or multifamily markets, was awarded to Blackstone and Wells Fargo. The award represented the latter’s role as buy-side M&A adviser and lead financing provider for Blackstone for the $10 billion acquisition of AIR Communities, which included a $2.65 billion term loan and $4 billion in SASB CMBS transactions. Life Sciences Transaction of the Year was awarded to Breakthrough Properties for its 15-year, 230,000-square-foot lease with Pfizer Oncology at the premier life sciences campus Torrey View in San Diego. “In this transaction,” said NYU’s Norman, “Pfizer drives its commitment to accelerating breakthroughs for cancer patients utilizing two state-of-the-art facilities at these buildings.” Then, a special award for Structured Debt Transaction of the Year was presented to Blackstone. “In March of this year, Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies acquired a $1 billion performing senior mortgage loan portfolio from German lender Deutsche PBB,” said Norman. “The portfolio consists of 11 loans secured against performing multifamily, office and hospitality assets across the U.K. and U.S. Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies acquired the entire portfolio on an all-cash basis. So we want to congratulate the team at Blackstone for the 2024 Structured Debt Transaction of the Year Breakthrough Award.” Shifting the focus to specific projects, the Sustainability Project of the Year was awarded to Bank of America for its financing of a $35 million construction loan for The Helios Project, a transformative, solar-powered, 186-unit affordable housing development in Virginia’s Henrico County. “Bank of America was thrilled to work with the Spy Rock Real Estate Group and Crescent Development team on an innovative project that will help revitalize Richmond by delivering much-needed high-quality housing,” said Sam Buzzelli, vice president of community development banking for Bank of America. “The Helios will feature an on-site solar array that generates solar power to operate the property while eliminating tenants’ electricity costs. This was our first project with the development team, but we’re glad to already be working together again.” The award for Adaptive Reuse Project of the Year, awarded for “the repurposing of a building that’s designed to, or has resulted in, a positive impact for the greater real estate community,” according to Norman, went to GFP Real Estate and TPG Real Estate for acquiring and transforming 222 Broadway from a 750,000-square-foot office tower into an 800-unit residential building. Norman referred to the winning project as “an amazing example of adaptive reuse.” “We are deeply honored to receive Commercial Observer’s 2024 Breakthrough Award for Adaptive Reuse Project of the Year alongside our partner, TPG, for our work on 222 Broadway,” said Brian Steinwurtzel, co-CEO and principal of GFP Real Estate. “This recognition is a testament to our shared vision and dedication to reimagining and revitalizing urban spaces. Thank you to Commercial Observer for this prestigious recognition, and congratulations to all the other winners who are shaping the future of our industry.” Design and Development Project of the Year was awarded to Pacific Retail Capital Partners for developing District Galleria, a $2.5 billion transformation of a regional shopping mall into a dynamic mixed-use, transit-oriented district in White Plains, New York. The Public-Private Partnership of the Year award then went to RXR and the City of New Rochelle for the opening of the luxury residential tower Two Clinton Park in New Rochelle, N.Y. “Thanks to Commercial Observer for recognizing this public-private partnership,” said Joseph Graziose, executive vice president of RXR, where he is head of construction and development. “It’s being awarded in 2024, but it’s 10 years in the making, a true testament to what the private and public sectors can do when they put their heads together.” Next up, Tech Advance of the Year was awarded to Savills for the development of the generative AI tool Savills GPT, which was developed in collaboration with OpenAI. “Thank you so much for the recognition for this, especially amongst such wonderful and amazing technology partners,” said Sarah Dreyer, executive vice president and chief information officer at Savills. “We’re really taking a collaborative and innovative approach to what we’re doing with our AI with our technology partners, and we’re excited to share more about it.” The next three awards rewarded firms advancing key asset classes through innovative approaches to design, development, financing and marketing. The award for Innovation in Residential went to Avdoo & Partners Development for the development of Bergen, a residential building designed by Taller Frida Escobedo and featuring 105 residences along with 14,513 square feet of indoor and 11,943 square feet of outdoor amenities. “We’re really excited to be part of such a strong group of peers that were nominated for this award today,” said Krystyn Gatto, Avdoo’s COO. “As you all know, it takes a great deal of effort from a really strong team to be able to make these projects come to life. It was a really unique opportunity to have 400 feet of linear frontage in Brooklyn, which is not very common, and create an urban oasis. Thank you so much for the award.” The Innovation in Industrial Award went to Alterra IOS, the investment platform for Alterra Property Group, for the redevelopment of 6110 Passyunk Avenue in Southwest Philadelphia from a 5-acre industrial outdoor storage site into a state-of-the-art soil remediation facility. The Innovation in Office Award then went to RXR for its RXO tenant experience program. “The RXO program is about elevating the tenant experience,” said Dave Gise, senior vice president and head of hospitality and amenities at RXR. “I wish my entire team was here today with me, but they’re actually elevating the tenant experience on site. So thank you. This means a lot.” The team awards kicked off with Gensler winning as the Top Architecture Team of the Year for its work on projects including Disney’s new headquarters, Google’s St. John’s Terminal, and IBM’s flagship office in New York. “It’s really our pleasure and honor to be a part of such an amazing world-class real estate community, and to help rebuild the fabric of New York,” said Amanda Carroll, managing director and principal at Gensler. “We’re really proud of our physical impact on the city of New York.” Top CRE Financier of the Year (Banks) was awarded to J.P. Morgan Chase based on more than $120 billion in multifamily loans, over $22 billion committed to affordable housing, and $173 billion in total commercial real estate loans in 2024. “We’ve carved out a unique niche as a development lender — a transitional lender — in an area which a lot of banks are not competing in these days, and we’re trying to fend off a lot of these non-bank lenders who are here today to be recognized as well,” said Jeremy Hellinger, a managing director at J.P. Morgan Chase. “We appreciate the amazing team and amazing clients that made this easy.” As a perfect follow-up to his comment, the award for Top Financier of the Year on the Non-Bank side went to Tyko Capital for projects including the provision of the $357 million construction loan for the Flatiron Building conversion project, a $527 million loan for the St. Regis Residences in Miami, and a $555 million long-term, permanent loan for 830 Brickell, Miami’s first new stand-alone office tower in over a decade. “We started in the advisory business as an unknown commodity 14 years back,” said Adi Chugh, Tyko’s founder & CEO. “And I got up one day and said, ‘We’re done with this business. We’re pivoting.’ And everybody said, ‘We are with you.’ Not one employee left. In 15 months, we’ve been able to deploy more than $5 billion.” The final award of the night, Law Firm of the Year, was presented to the Real Estate and Land Use teams at Kramer Levin for handling billions of dollars of transactions for clients such as BlackRock, The Carlyle Group, Mount Sinai Hospital, NYU Langone Medical Center, The Nederlander Organization, Vornado Realty Trust and The Walt Disney Company, among many others. “I want to thank Commercial Observer for the honor, and for bringing greater transparency to our industry,” said Jay Neveloff, partner and chair of the real estate practice at Kramer Levin. “I want to thank my team, which I am incredibly proud to be part of. And I want to thank the other law firms that were recognized. It’s terrific when you have law firms you can collaborate with to get things done efficiently and in the right way.” In the face of a tumultuous and uncertain period for commercial real estate, the Commercial Observer Breakthrough Awards shined a positive light on the state of the industry, and left attendees with a sense of hope and promise for the future. “The general spirit of the room and the fact that it was a sold-out event,” said Freiman, “all indicate that there is a strong confidence in the market as we head into a new year.” Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Title: 3 Enormous Supercomputers May Now Be In The Works

A smart phone is displaying the NVIDIA Corporation stock price on the NASDAQ market, with an NVIDIA ... [+] chip visible in the background, in this photo illustration taken in Brussels, Belgium, on December 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) When I wrote about XAI’s Colossus project a few weeks ago, the scale of the initiative seemed, for lack of a better word, dizzying. You can look back at the video with Patrick from ServetheHome leading the audience through the halls of a supercomputing cluster ostensibly created to power XAI’s Grok chatbot: you can see row after row, rack after rack, of processors set in powerful motion, like a massive army, marching in lock-step and served with enormous amounts of electricity and water. According to recent news, a major vendor of AI hardware is now claiming that three of its major customers are planning projects on the colossal scale of Colossus. Broadcom reports that no fewer than three of its clients may develop data centers with 1,000,000 processors by 2027. This came from the company Q4 earnings call Dec 12, where leaders cited a 220% spike in revenue for the year. "As you know, we currently have three hyperscale customers who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU roadmap to be deployed at varying rates over the next three years," President and CEO of Broadcom Hock Tan reportedly said on the call. "In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1,000,000 XPU clusters across a single fabric." For reference, Colossus started by reporting a need of 100,000 GPUs. After quickly doubling that order, Musk then came out with the frank update: that the center would require a cool million of the Nvidia GPUs that run there. Industry leaders like Jensen Huang marveled over the breakneck pace of the data center’s construction: so did notable journalists. It seemed like a unicorn. But is this kind of project, within the next few years, going to become de rigueur? The available reporting clarifies that there are no specific identifications of who is planning these enormous designs. Ask ChatGPT, and it will confirm this, although the model does give a list of top companies that it believes are more capable of scaling up these kinds of plans, including: · Nvidia · Microsoft · Amazon Web Services · Google · OpenAI · Meta · Tesla In addition, ChatGPT cites a collection of Chinese companies that have their own large data center capabilities, including Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu. When you dig a little deeper, it looks like most of these companies are pretty far from this metric. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg has publicly said that the company is aiming for about 350,000 data center GPUs by the end of this year. Google has estimated a total of 2 million GPUs in all of its global operations, not just one center. As for major clusters at AWS, where the hardware provides B2B services, one of the official numbers is that AWS has built a virtual supercomputer performing 9.95 petaflops, which looks like it would require a couple of hundred Nvidia H100s. So a million GPUs is still a really big deal. While the news is impressive, some are likely to be less than enthused about the idea of multiple data centers of this size. If we go back to Colossus, we have critics on the record talking about what they fear in terms of resource competition by this power-hungry behemoth. For one thing, Colossus is estimated to need up to 1,000,000 gallons of water per day - where you often see per capita municipal usage of around 100 gallons per day. There’s also the use of natural gas turbines to provide all of that energy… Experts have been suggesting for a while now that the U.S. is poised to expand nuclear power infrastructure, in order to power data centers, and specifically, to locate the power sources right next to the superclusters in order to make things more efficient. But even if they’re 100% efficient, it’s obvious that the power needs are going to be immense. As key journalists and others covering this issue have been pointing out, things are moving at an incredibly rapid pace. We’re going to have to figure out what impact these supercomputers are making on our society, because even though Colossus is the only one publicly identified as in the works, others are likely to be here soon.

Title: Friedrich Merz: German conservative gunning to become chancellor

Manage your account German opposition leader Friedrich Merz, who hopes to become the next chancellor, is a millionaire ex-corporate lawyer who promises a return to his CDU party's conservative roots as an alternative to the far right. Now that centre-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz has lost a confidence vote following the dramatic collapse of his three-party coalition, Merz may soon get his chance after decades of waiting in the wings. Although he has never held government office, polls say Merz is the favourite to win the February 23 election. Merz, a 69-year-old Roman Catholic, hails from the rural Sauerland region of North Rhine-Westphalia and is the top candidate of the Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian allies the CSU. A long-time rival of the CDU's centrist ex-chancellor Angela Merkel, Merz has criticised her legacy, from her open-door policy to migrants to her insistence on maintaining dialogue with Russia. Merz is a pro-business economic liberal, who published a book in 2008 titled "Dare More Capitalism", a passionate advocate of transatlantic ties and the European Union, and a defender of traditional social values. First elected to the Bundestag three decades ago, Merz took over the CDU leadership on his third attempt after its 2021 election defeat and was confirmed as its chancellor candidate in September. Firmly on the right of the CDU, Merz has backed a tougher immigration policy and law and order stance and pledged to reverse marijuana legalisation and Germany's phase-out of nuclear power, as he seeks to win back voters who have drifted to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). - Seeing red - Merz has sparked anger by labelling the sons of Muslim immigrants "little pashas" and accusing some Ukrainian war refugees of "social welfare tourism", before later apologising. In recent months he has led the charge in raining down withering criticism on Scholz's government, blaming its "wrongheaded" policies and "green-tinted interventionism" for the woes of Germany's stuttering economy. He is rhetorically skilled and visibly enjoys a good political scrap. The news magazine Der Spiegel said he also tends to take conflicts personally and is given to fits of anger, writing that "if Merz were a bullfighter, he would probably hold the red cloth in front of his stomach". Scholz too has tried to portray his rival as a "hothead" who would play "Russian roulette" with Moscow, by sending long-range missiles to Ukraine. Nonetheless, according to news weekly Die Zeit, the old-school conservative is "currently the CDU's answer" to the recent electoral successes of the AfD, which is polling at close to 20 percent. - Hobby pilot - Merz was born on November 11, 1955 and has been married for more than 40 years to Charlotte Merz, a judge. They have three adult children. Merz, who at 198 cm (6ft 6 in) stands out in a crowd, is a licensed pilot who sometimes flies his own private jet. Trained as a lawyer, he was elected to the European Parliament in 1989 and then to the Bundestag, where his mentor was the CDU's powerful late finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. But Merz lost out in a power struggle against Merkel, who took over the CDU leadership in 2002 as the party struggled to rebuild after Helmut Kohl's chancellorship ended in a slush fund scandal. Merkel went on to become Germany's second-longest serving post-war chancellor while Merz -- humiliated, and his influence greatly diminished -- opted for a hiatus from politics. He left parliament in 2009 and for over a decade pursued a successful career in the private sector. He worked as a corporate lawyer, built up a personal fortune and held senior positions on the boards of US investment firm BlackRock and multiple other companies. His business world success and wealth have left him open to charges of being out of touch with most German voters -- a claim he has rejected by insisting he belongs to the "upper middle class". ilp-sr-jsk/fz/giv NATO officials estimate more than one million people have been killed or injured in Ukraine since Russia invaded the country in February 2022. A supposed ABC News clip reporting that around one million Ukrainian soldiers alone have died in the conflict is altered; the original segment on fighters receiving prosthetics in the United States did not address casualty estimates, and other sources say the number of military fatalities is far lower . In the shadow of derelict, Soviet-era factories on the outskirts of Tallinn, Nato’s “Baltic backbone” is being forged with British steel and EU funds. Donald Trump appears to have debuted a new look—and the reviews it’s getting on social media are less than glowing. Trump’s signature hairstyle—golden, puffed-up, and tightly coiffed—has been an iconic part of his brand since long before he stepped into the political arena. But a new video of the president-elect circulating on social media seems to show him with a totally different do. In a clip posted by one of Trump’s supporters at his golf club in Palm Beach, his mane appears to be more compa Wrapping up their own investigation on the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack, House Republicans have concluded it's former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney who should be prosecuted for probing what happened when then-President Donald Trump sent his mob of supporters as Congress was certifying the 2020 election. The findings issued Tuesday show the Republican Party working to reinforce Trump's desire to punish his perceived enemies including Cheney and members of the Jan. 6 committee that the president-elect has said should be in jail. President-elect Trump dropped a round of ambassador nominations on social media Tuesday night, naming Herschel Walker and Nicole McGraw as nominees to serve in the Bahamas and Croatia. Barring any last-minute sabotage from the West (again), it appears the Ukrainian president might have just “blinked.” There was “a lot of lying from the president-elect” but one comment stood out, said Daniel Dale. "I think this is a red alert moment," Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy told the MSNBC host. Republican Sen. Eric Schmitt (Mo.) on Tuesday blocked a request by Democratic senators to pass legislation to protect federal workers from civil service reforms that President-elect Trump has endorsed to fight what he calls the “deep state” in Washington, D.C. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine (D) stood on the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon to ask for unanimous… A new report reveals several grounds on which House Republicans are preparing to punish Liz Cheney. Head of RT Margarita Simonyan, a decorated state TV propagandist and Kremlin insider, has spilled not only Russia’s hopes and dreams for Donald Trump’s second term in office but also Moscow’s strategy for suckering him in. She believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin has an irresistible sway over Trump and will extract the desired outcome—but only if they meet face-to-face, without any influence or interference from other American power brokers, à la Helsinki, where the two men held discus Andre Rush also suggested ways he would "manipulate" the president-elect's diet to make it healthier if he were to serve in the next administration. The House Ethics Committee secretly voted earlier this month to release its report into the conduct of former Rep. Matt Gaetz before the end of this Congress, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the matter. President-elect Trump’s attorney unsuccessfully asked a federal judge to move forward with his lawsuit against journalist Bob Woodward over published audio tapes of interviews the famed Watergate reporter conducted with Trump for a 2020 book. U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe, an appointee of former President George W. Bush who is overseeing the case, denied the… "This can’t be legal," said an X user. "Why does this administration want to weaken the United States?" The president-elect has teased it before, albeit under the cover of "jokes." John Kirby, the spokesperson for the National Security Council, told CNN Monday that the drones reported recently over New Jersey and other East Coast states do not pose a threat to the public, and “represent lawful, legal, commercial [and] hobbyist drones—even law enforcement drones.” When asked by AC360 anchor John Berman whether the drones might pose a risk, Kirby was clear. “The answer to that is no. We don‘t propose to see any national security or public safety risk by these drones and thes Stephanopoulos was particularly upset with being forced to apologize to Trump in a statement that was released by his employer, The Post has learned. Syrian leader Bashar Assad issued what appeared to be his first public statement since he was ousted and fled with his family to Russia more than a week ago. "Get it together, America." President-elect Trump suffered a major loss in his bid to toss his New York criminal conviction when a judge ruled Monday that the guilty verdict withstands the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling. While Trump’s effort to dismiss the case now that he’s president-elect is still pending, Judge Juan Merchan’s latest ruling shot down the former… Donald Trump’s felony conviction in the New York hush money case should not be tossed out because of the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity, Judge Juan Merchan ruled Monday. President-elect Trump condemned Judge Juan Merchan’s decision allowing a jury verdict to stand in the hush money case despite the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this year that largely shields former presidents from criminal prosecution. Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social that the judge’s decision “completely disrespected the United States Supreme Court, and its… A former White House chef spilled the tea on Donald Trump’s favorite meals—and why the president-elect may have a healthier diet than many Americans think. Chef Andre Rush, who also worked as a chef in the White House for the likes of Trump, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, told Politico’s West Wing Playbook that the upcoming 47th President of the United States likes to keep his meals simple and isn’t the biggest fan of snacking. While Trump is notably a fan of the classic Amercan Tom Homan, President-elect Donald Trump's incoming 'border czar,' reacts to the arrest of suspected Tren de Aragua gang members in Aurora, Colo., on 'America Reports.' When Bernard Jones Jr. and his wife, Doris, built their dream home, they didn’t hold back. With water, electricity, clean air and food, they felt ready for any disaster, even a nuclear blast, at their bucolic home in California’s Inland Empire. Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. George Stephanopoulos is famously meticulous. He does not slip up. He used to arrive each day at 2:30 a.m. for Good Morning America, the show he has co-hosted for the past 15 years, so that “his face could settle” before going on air at 7 a.m. He would then monastically eat an apple at 9 a.m. after each show. He runs, he works out, he meditates—he’s out of book parties before they’ve barely begun, and he sleeps early. The name of his and his wife Ali Wentworth’s production company is literal: Be "I feel like I sold all these students a load of garbage." Donald Trump Jr.’s new girlfriend, Bettina Anderson, has ruffled feathers in MAGA land by showing interest in serving on a White House philanthropic committee and by generally not being sufficiently on brand, according to a new report. The 38-year-old Palm Beach socialite has been pushing to lead the president’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities, saying she could help the incoming administration appeal to “more sophisticated and liberal Hamptons and Palm Beach types,”the New York Post reports North Carolina legislators voted this month to ask Congress to call for convention of states to suggest changes to the U.S. Constitution. Some Republican legislators have been pushing to file an application for a constitutional convention for more than a decade. North Carolina’s resolution is added to the pile of requests for a convention that […] President-elect Donald Trump on Monday suggested that he may reverse President Joe Biden's recent decision to allow Ukrainian forces to use American long-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory. Trump called the decision made by Biden last month “stupid." With the loosening of the restrictions, Biden gave Ukraine long-sought permission to use the Army Tactical Missile System provided by the U.S. to strike Russian positions hundreds miles from its border. President-elect Donald Trump has assembled the wealthiest presidential administration in modern history, with at least 13 billionaires set to take on government posts. In total, the combined net worth of the wealthiest members of his administration could surpass $460 billion, including Department of Government Efficiency co-head Elon Musk -- whose net worth of more than $400 billion exceeds the GDP of mid-sized countries. Trump is calling on President Biden to "stop selling the wall," but the White House said it is following the law for unused wall pieces. Fox News host Jesse Watters highlights how Michelle Obama and VP Kamala Harris, despite previously expressing concerns, no longer seem very worried about the incoming President-elect Donald Trump. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) said on Tuesday that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told him he has come to an agreement with President-elect Trump on the issue of abortion, concluding the matter will be left to the states to decide. Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Health and… Commentators roasted Vice President Kamala Harris for the latest of many confusing verbal statements given during a public appearance, this time at a community college. “If people don’t come back to work, come back into the office, they’re going to be dismissed,” the president-elect said. The brazen street bombing of a top Russian general could reflect Ukraine's wish to hit Moscow hard before Donald Trump takes office and any negotiations begin. House Republican leader challenged over tech billionaire’s opposition to latest stop-gap funding deal High in the mountains of the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, the town of Majdal Shams is home to members of one of the Middle East’s most insular religious minorities: the Druze. With its roots in 10th century Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam, the roughly 1 million-strong minority is spread across Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Golan Heights. American warplanes could be kept from joining the fray of a conflict with China for days or weeks, analysts have concluded. Donald Trump Jr may be the most MAGA member of his family apart from his father, but some of his inner circle apparently fear his new girlfriend’s credentials don’t quite match up. Chuck Klein says postal workers must deliver mail to his property, but the service says it's unsafe. The case may impact rural delivery nationwide. Florida Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz on Tuesday shut down rumors that he could sign onto Donald Trump’s upcoming presidential administration. A Monday CNN report had said that Moskowitz was a favorite to become the president-elect’s pick to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which would have made him the highest-ranking Democrat in Trump’s administration. Moskowitz has now made it clear, though, that he isn’t interested in holding that title.

Title: House Committee Says It Finds Evidence of ‘Climate Cartel’

The House Judiciary Committee said it’s found “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. An interim report published by the Republican-led committee said “a cartel” of financial firms and climate activists sought to replace Exxon Mobil Corp. board members in 2021 after the company declined to make a series of climate pledges. “Unfortunately, the pressure campaign against Exxon Mobil isn’t an isolated incident,” the committee wrote. “Through coordinated shareholder pressure campaigns at US companies, the climate cartel seeks to use the trillions of dollars it manages to impose its agenda on the US economy and drain it of affordable energy.” Far from igniting strategic turmoil, the actions against Exxon led by a firm called Engine No. 1 coincided with a massive upturn in the company’s fortunes. The oil giant made record profits in 2022 and its stock outperformed rivals as crude prices bounced back from the pandemic. Exxon now has plans to produce more oil and gas by 2030 than at any time since the 1970s, and also spend $30 billion on low-carbon ventures like carbon capture, hydrogen and lithium. The judiciary committee, chaired by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, singled out groups including Climate Action 100+ and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero for leading what they described as a climate crusade. The committee said its investigation is ongoing. The claims by the House Judiciary Committee are “completely false,” said a spokesperson for CA100+, adding that the group “doesn’t control how shareholders vote, nor has it ever done so.” Last month, BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by boosting electricity prices through their investments. BlackRock and State Street both pushed back against the allegations. State Street, for example, said the suit is “baseless and we look forward to presenting the facts through the legal process.” Vanguard declined to comment when contacted after the suit was filed on Nov. 27. The committee’s report is the latest salvo against environmental, social and governance investing. And the expectation is that President-elect Donald Trump will add his support to the GOP’s attacks against ESG.

Title: From $45,000 to $500,000, here's the bull and bear case for bitcoin in 2025
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-2025-price-outlook-ranges-45000-to-250000-wall-street-2024-12

Bitcoin has been on a tear in 2024, surging 145% year-to-date and breaching the psychological $106,000 in recent days. The volatile cryptocurrency has been a polarizing asset, but with an incoming Trump administration, combined with the launch of bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, it seems more and more investors are starting to embrace bitcoin. But not everyone is bullish, and there are some on Wall Street who still see a coming correction in 2025. Here are the biggest bear and bull cases for the token next year. Chief global strategist Peter Berezin of BCA Research expects bitcoin to crash in 2025. Berezin, who is bearish on risk assets broadly for next year on the expectation that a recession will hit, said that bitcoin will finish 2025 at around $45,000, marking a decline of 57% from current levels. With his bearish outlook, Berezin said gold would finally outperform bitcoin in 2025, as investors seek safe-haven assets amid a period of economic weakness. To that point, he argues that bitcoin is not a store of value like gold, but is instead simply a high-beta play on technology stocks. The strategist provided the chart below, which shows the strong correlation between the price of bitcoin and the ProShares UltraPro QQQ 3x Shares ETF. The three-times levered ETF seeks to track daily movements in the Nasdaq 100 Index. Since 2018, the price of bitcoin has closely tracked the fund, with both assets trading about 650% higher in that time. Thus, a crash in tech stocks brought on by a bear market in 2025 would also spark a steep drop in the price of bitcoin. Way on the other end of the spectrum of bitcoin forecasts is Fundstrat's Tom Lee, who is highly bullish on the coin for next year. The strategist said the cryptocurrency is on track to soar 140% in 2025 to $250,000. However, the crypto could soar even higher if the Trump administration establishes a national bitcoin reserve. According to Lee, there are two tailwinds for bitcoin heading into the new year. The first is the halving price cycle for the cryptocurrency, which tends to be bullish for the price of bitcoin in the year following a halving event. The last bitcoin halving occurred on April 20 with another scheduled every four years. A halving reduces the amount of bitcoin that miners are rewarded for solving cryptographic problems by half, limiting the supply of new crypto coming to market. With new supply slashed, the price should rise if demand stays constant or increases. The second factor that is bullish for bitcoin in 2025 is "friendlier government regulations," Lee said in his outlook note last week. President-elect Donald Trump is viewed as a close ally to the crypto space, and his recent administration picks, like Paul Atkins for SEC Chairman, have been cheered by the market. And there could be even more upside for bitcoin in 2025 if a US strategic reserve is announced and implemented. "Our Head of Digital Assets Strategy, Sean Farrell, believes that a US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve adds upside to Bitcoin as much as $500,000 in 2025," Lee said in a Monday note. That target represents a 381% increase from current levels. Finally, Lee highlighted that a recent white paper from BlackRock recommends a 2% portfolio allocation to bitcoin for investors. The recommendation could spark further institutional adoption of bitcoin and fuel demand for the crypto, helping push the price higher.

Title: Truist Securities: NVIDIA To Tap ~$35 Billion In New TAM By Launching A Client-Side CPU In 2025

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA is ending 2024 on a historically strong footing, and 2025 might turn out to be equally auspicious provided that the GPU maker is able to deliver on Wall Street's lofty expectations. Today, Truist Securities raised the proverbial bar on the expectations count by incorporating a whole new product segment within its stock price target computations for NVIDIA. NVIDIA $NVDA price-target raised to $204 (from $169) at Truist Securities, implying +54% upside. Analyst Will Stein expects Nvidia to announce a client-side CPU in 2025, which would unlock an additional $35 billion in TAM: "Incrementally constructive on AI dominance & client… — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) December 16, 2024 Truist Securities analyst, Will Stein, dropped a bombshell today by pegging expectations of an entirely new product segment to NVIDIA's 2025 projections: "We believe NVDA will announce a client-side CPU during 2025, opening up an additional ~$35B TAM." The analyst remains "incrementally constructive on [NVIDIA's] AI dominance & client CPU," while noting that the stock has proven to be a "home-run investment over the last two years owing to a new wave of AI demand." Stein expects 2025 to be another "constructive" year for NVIDIA due to the opening up of its CPU-related TAM and continuing market dominance via its full technology stack: "All relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack (not just chips...or servers...or even server racks...but especially software and pre-trained models)." Accordingly, the analyst has raised his price target for NVIDIA shares from $169 to $204, implying a ~54 percent upside potential relative to the current price level. Meanwhile, as we recently reported, NVIDIA's next-gen "Blackwell Ultra" GB300 AI servers are expected to debut by mid-2025. Despite suffering initial setbacks from several minor design flaws, NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture is slated for significant expansion in 2025, as per the trend that can be gleaned from the GPU manufacturer's supply chain partners. This dovetails with recent reports that suggest ongoing discussions between NVIDIA and TSMC to manufacture Blackwell GPUs in the latter's Arizona facilities. Bear in mind that the outgoing Biden administration recently awarded TSMC $6.6 billion in new funding to incentivize its production facilities in Arizona, where commercial activities are currently slated to commence in the first half of 2025.

Red Cat shares rallied 27% on news that it's working with Palantir to integrate visual navigation software into its drones. The ticker RCAT has been the sixth-most-popular mention on Reddit's famed WallStreetBets page over the last 24 hours, behind only crypto play MicroStrategy, Nvidia, Tesla, Palantir and SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust), according to data tracking firm Quiver Quantitative. RCAT's popularity on WSB has surged more than 1,625% in the past 24 hours, the firm said. Donald Trump Jr.-affiliated Unusual Machines was another big winner Monday, surging about 16%. Kratos Defense and Security Solutions added about 5%. Aerovironment gained 8%. The partnership news comes as recent sightings across the Northeast have reignited interest in the sector, while also fueling national security concerns. FBI officials on Thursday said there was "no evidence" that the drones jeopardize "national security and public safety." Officials also said Saturday that many of the sightings are "manned aircraft being misidentified as drones." Many on Wall Street view the incoming White House administration as a potential boon that could boost funding for the sector and U.S.-made drones. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has spoken favorably of drone technology and is poised to play an influential role in President-elect Donald Trump's White House. "On the drone protection side, federal government counter-drone technologies are increasingly being used by local and state law enforcement to protect stadiums, airports, prisons, and other public settings," said William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma in a note to clients. "This will likely result in a surge in counter-drone investments by local and state government agencies over the next decade." Investors have also come to view ties to the sector through Trump Jr.'s connection to Unusual Machines as another potential tailwind for the industry. The eldest son of the president-elect joined the advisory board of the company in November. Congress has also taken interest in the sector. The National Defense Bill, recently passed in the House, is also drawing interest. If the bill is passed by the Senate and signed into law, China-based DJI would be barred from selling new drones to the U.S. — CNBC's Yun Li contributed reporting. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: How Walmart's $90 billion Sam's Club is aiming to take down Costco

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Sam's Club is riding the dual waves of Walmart's (WMT) rise as budget-conscious consumers flock to wholesale retailers. Led by CEO Chris Nicholas, who started in September 2023, the wholesale club founded in 1983 by Walmart founder Sam Walton has been a beneficiary of inflation-weary shoppers. In its most recent fiscal quarter, same-store sales, excluding fuel, jumped 7%, compared to a 3.8% increase in the same time period a year ago. Through the nine months ended Oct. 31, Sam's Club has hauled in $67.2 billion in sales and $1.8 billion in operating profits. Walmart's third largest business segment behind its namesake and international division is on track to post close to $90 billion in sales this year, according to analyst estimates. Parent company Walmart, with its own string of record-breaking quarters, in part powered by Sam's Club, is the 2024 Yahoo Finance Company of the Year award winner. "We are the essence of the Walmart culture," Nicholas said. "We've spent the last year really getting after this really exciting growth agenda." Experts contend that one key aspect that differentiates Sam's Club from rivals like Costco (COST) and BJ's (BJ) is its investment in technology. "Costco is clearly the market share leader in the club space, ... we think Sam's Club is a formidable competitor," CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram told Yahoo Finance, "One area where Sam's Club is better than Costco currently is related to their technology, and that's because it's backed by Walmart, which is very technology savvy, unlike Costco." Sam's Club's Scan and Go technology, now rolled out in most locations, allows members to skip the checkout line. Shoppers scan items' barcodes on the app as they go along, pay in-app, and a member checks a few items to ensure they match the customer's order upon walking out. The Just Go exit arches do that job for the employees, using computer vision to quickly scan items as shoppers exit. Costco posted e-commerce growth of 13.2%, compared to Sam's Club 26% gain in the latest quarter. "You need to be technology savvy to win younger generations," Sundaram said. Nicholas has been in the retail industry for more than two decades. He started pricing goods at a grocery store in Hull, England as a 14-year-old. "The first day I was there, the store manager said to me, 'Listen, Chris, you've got to take this cage of goods and hide it because my regional manager is coming around this afternoon, and he doesn't know I bought all of this inventory,'" Nicholas recalled. "So I tell that story to my managers. I'm like, 'I'm watching you. Please don't do that.'" In 1983, Walton opened the first Sam's Club in Midwest City, Okla. His intention was to help other small businesses access products and services. It was also shortly after its competitor Costco (COST), then known as Price Club, made its debut in the 1970s in San Diego. As of November, there are 600 Sam's Club locations in the US. Costco and BJ's Wholesale operate 625 and 266 stores in the US, respectively. Sam's Club also has 50 locations open in China, under the leadership of Walmart International CEO Kath McLay, with plans to open more in the country, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi. Here, Nicholas shares his thoughts with Yahoo Finance on Sam's Club's growth potential, what's working, and how it's investing in tech to compete. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Yahoo Finance: September marked one year since you became Sam's Club CEO. How would you describe your year? Chris Nicholas: Sam's Club is this little $90 billion business hidden in the corner of Walmart. You get to see the essence of our culture, and you get to do things as a pioneer, as an innovator, that you can only do because you're the little $90 billion company in the corner. [Our] growth agenda is focused on getting digital engagement with our members. ... Probably the thing that stands out most there is the digital engagement in the clubs and e-commerce, ... Scan and Go, and those Just Go arches. The third thing is great items, great value. [Private label] Members Mark would be the pinnacle of that. Sam’s Club had quite the year. Same-store sales in the recent fiscal quarter were up 7%, excluding fuel. What were the main drivers of growth? In the club business, the best health check you can have is how many members you've got and are they renewing. We're really happy that we've got all-time highs in membership and in renewal rates. ... [What] helped us grow even faster is this idea of experiences. ... There's been this idea ... that you can't have great experiences because it costs money. We really disagree with that. We've been investing really hard, whether it's leveraging the Walmart platforms or e-commerce and supply chain to building these new technologies that people are engaging with in unprecedented ways. In e-commerce, specifically, what is driving growth there? I've been in the e-commerce, retail business for more than 20-odd years now. It's not a new thing. Here's the thing, people want you to give them what they want. They want more. They want better items. They want more quality. They want lower prices. And they want you to serve them however they want to be served. Our job is to give them all of that, so if you have the choice, ... you can come into the club and shop, but if we can pick it for you, and you just pick it up, or we can deliver those items from the club to your home, or if you want an extended assortment, we can send them from the fulfillment center, but you still get Sam's Club prices. Sam's Club would be 20% to 25% cheaper than retail. You can get e-commerce delivered to your home, or you can pick it up, without the friction of shopping, at club prices. That's just an incredible value proposition, and we think is unmatchable. Are people still mostly going to Sam's Club for groceries? The tradition of the club model would be: You come with a flatbed or a big car, and you fill everything up, and you do it once a month. That's not the way that people shop us. Now, people are much more prone to come to us for the top-up shop, for the lobster mac and cheese and the bottle of Russian River Pinot or whatever that you want and hopefully pick up some GM [general merchandise] on the way. We think that we are not just a grocer, but we do enjoy that frequency of visit with our amazing fresh business and food businesses. On top of that frequency driver of grocery, ... you get the treasure hunt of general merchandise items, whether that's technology or wares or seasonal items or apparel. ... We want to be a GM business, a services business, and a grocer. Read more: Best credit cards for groceries (December 2024) Sam's Club is a membership model — who is its audience? At the heart of it, the Sam's Club member is [the] better-off-than-average family. ... We see great growth in our business members, we see exceptional growth with small, young families that are just coming through and starting their journey. Whilst we might tether on the wealthier shopper with family, we want to serve everybody. How is Sam's Club competing with rivals? Of course, Costco is such a prevalent player in the space. If you take a look at the whole of the club channel, that's less than 7% of total retail in the US. ... Whilst you can get better always by looking at your competitors and looking at what they're doing better than you, your main focus better be what your members are asking for. Trust is more important in the club model than anywhere, and the reason is because I'm asking you to pay me up front for the promise of value in the future. We spend a lot of time working on "How do you build an ecosystem that just takes all of the decision making away from you?" Because you just know you get the right value from Sam's Club, and then you go tell your friends, and then they come join. How is Sam's Club investing in technology? Think about the back end of your technology and the member-facing [part]. The back end is really difficult to invest in, [it] takes a long time, and it's really great that Walmart has already built a lot of those platforms. What we're doing is leveraging on the back end of the supply chain technology ... automation, the e-commerce technology — that's all of the stuff that they do in the fulfillment centers and the clubs but also the app that members use and our associates use. All of that takes a lot of time and a lot of effort. I'm really grateful that we're part of Walmart, so we get to leverage that. That means the Sam's Club engineers are able to focus on creating disruptive, pioneering, delightful experiences for our members that we wouldn't be able to do if we didn't have that backbone, that back end. [At] CES last January, ... we announced that we were going to roll out these computer vision arches ... if you use Scan and Go, you can walk out [of the store] and there's zero friction. This year, we've used technology that's computer vision ... to take 100 million tasks out of our associates hands in clubs. We don't have fewer associates. They just don't have to do the mundane things they used to do: the paperwork, the clipboards, the how do you find the inventory? How do you solve problems for members? Are you thinking about artificial intelligence in that capacity? AI is everywhere. We've been working on AI for a long time. ... The Scan and Go is a great example of AI. We're using AI to help with search. We use AI to help with recommendations on the app, ... recommendations if you may have forgotten something. ... We're using AI to look at how you transacted with us before. AI is becoming rooted in everything that we're doing, but we're doing it in a way that's human, and I think that's a really important nuance for us. How are you thinking about potential issues ahead — like tariffs — under the new administration? We've got a limited assortment in Sam's Club, so that gives a lot of agility and flexibility, and our exposure to imports is insignificant. How about the reacceleration of inflation? What are you seeing there, and do you expect any change in 2025? My merchandise team [fights] every single day to reduce prices for our members. ... That is what the club model does. This is the moment for the Sam's Club business model. The Sam's model and the club model, in general, shouldn't make any money on what we sell, so the lower you can run your operation in terms of cost, the lower you bring your prices down and you make your profit from membership. It's a really cool model because what it means is that you get better items and sell them cheaper, you get more engagement, and those members then renew with you, and they tell their friends, and they come and join your club. This is why the club model is such a great place right now, and that's not just in the US. ... We see that globally.

Title: MicroStrategy Stock Jumps On Nasdaq 100 Inclusion—Bitcoin Giant Up 570% This Year
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/12/16/microstrategy-stock-jumps-on-nasdaq-100-inclusion-bitcoin-giant-up-570-this-year/
Time Published: 2024-12-16T14:33:02Z
Full Content:
Shares of MicroStrategy rallied Monday after the corporate bitcoin holder earned a spot in a key stock index, an apparent institutional vote of confidence in the company whose stock has been red hot amid the cryptocurrency boom. MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor speaks at a 2021 conference. MicroStrategy stock gained 4% at market open, enjoying a bump from the Nasdaq announcing after Friday’s close that the Virginia-based company would join its Nasdaq 100 stock index next Monday. The inclusion on the Nasdaq 100, which is the basis for the popular Invesco QQQ exchange-traded fund, should result in about $2.1 billion in net buying of MicroStrategy shares as portfolios adjust to the move, according to Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. Also boosting the share price of MicroStrategy, which trades under the ticker MSTR, was a weekend rally for bitcoin, which hit a fresh all-time high Monday of over $106,000; almost all of MicroStrategy’s underlying value is tied to its bitcoin horde rather than a more traditional revenue-based business model. MicroStrategy stock has gained a robust 573% in 2024, outstripping bitcoin’s 150% gain and the S&P 500’s 29% return. Shares of the other two new Nasdaq 100 entrants, Axon Enterprise and Palantir, had less stark reactions, with Taser stun gun maker Axon stock up 1% and analytics-based defense contractor Palantir trading flat. MicroStrategy describes itself as the “world's first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company.” Part of the dot-com boom at the turn of the millennium, MicroStrategy shifted its focus beginning in 2020 from its software business to becoming the most prominent voice advocating for bitcoin as a long-term store of value akin to gold. The company owns 439,000 bitcoins in its strategic reserve, equivalent to $46 billion, or 2.2% of the world’s total bitcoin supply. Some 40% of MicroStrategy’s bitcoins have been acquired over the last 40 days, according to Chhugani, dating back to the election of Donald Trump, an outspoken bitcoin ally. MicroStrategy has taken the rare step of issuing debt to fund its bitcoin purchases. “If you are not a Bitcoin believer, this is scary, but MSTR’s Bitcoin strategy is a long term high-conviction ‘buy & hold’ strategy with the view to hold Bitcoin till it surpasses Gold and beyond,” Chhugani wrote Monday. MicroStrategy certainly has its critics, including investment firm Citron Research, which announced a short position on MicroStrategy stock last month, calling the stock “overheated” and “completely detached” from bitcoin fundamentals. With a market capitalization of about $100 billion, MicroStrategy trades more than two times higher than its bitcoin holdings, with its other operations hardly offering much further support, as its software business brought in less than $120 million last quarter. 2,700%. That’s how much MicroStrategy stock has returned over the last five years. That easily outranks the roughly 2,200% and 1,600% gains from the S&P’s top performers during that stretch in artificial intelligence darling Nvidia and Elon Musk-led electric vehicle company Tesla, respectively, according to FactSet. MicroStrategy’s outspoken founder and chairman Michael Saylor is worth more than $10 billion, making him the 254th-richest person in the world. His net worth has more than doubled since March.

Mutual funds offer diversification, income and long-term growth potential. As investors seek professional portfolio management and diversification, mutual funds remain a cornerstone of long-term investment strategies for growth and income. For 2025, I've identified five outstanding funds that offer a combination of strong management teams, proven track records and attractive prospects across different investment styles and asset classes. My selection process focused on funds with consistent long-term performance, experienced management teams and reasonable expenses. I evaluated risk-adjusted returns, manager tenure, fund strategy consistency and asset growth management. Special consideration was given to funds that have successfully navigated different market cycles while maintaining their investment discipline and demonstrating strong risk management practices.

Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days. Key Metrics: Led by legendary manager Will Danoff since 1990, Fidelity Contrafund employs a growth-oriented strategy focusing on companies with underappreciated earnings potential. The fund maintains a diversified portfolio of roughly 300 stocks, biased toward large-cap growth companies. Fidelity Contrafund's appeal stems from its exceptional combination of seasoned management and proven stock selection ability. Under Danoff's leadership, the fund has outperformed its benchmark in 24 of the past 32 years, generating an alpha of 2.9% annually over the S&P 500. The fund's proprietary research process, supported by Fidelity's 200-plus analyst team, has consistently identified emerging growth leaders early–including significant positions in Meta and Nvidia before their massive runs. Despite its large asset base, the fund has maintained its performance edge with a sophisticated trading approach that resulted in an implementation shortfall of just 0.15% in 2024. The strategy's focus on companies with sustainable competitive advantages has led to superior downside protection, capturing only 85% of market declines while participating in 95% of upside moves over the past decade. Key Metrics: Growth Fund of America utilizes American Funds' distinctive multiple portfolio counselor system, with each manager independently running a portion of the fund's assets. This approach combines diverse investment perspectives while focusing on high-quality growth companies. Growth Fund of America distinguishes itself through its unique multi-manager system and remarkable consistency. The fund's team of 12 portfolio counselors, averaging 25 years of experience, has delivered excess returns of 2.1% annually over its benchmark for the past decade. The multiple portfolio counselor approach has resulted in superior risk-adjusted returns, with a Sharpe ratio of 0.92 versus 0.78 for its peer group. The fund's low expense ratio of 0.62% is impressive given its active management approach and extensive global research capabilities. Portfolio construction excellence is evident in the fund's sector allocation decisions, which added 175 basis points of excess return in 2024. The fund's low turnover of 25% demonstrates its long-term investment approach, resulting in tax efficiency with a tax-cost ratio of just 0.45% annually.

Key Metrics: This fund focuses on undervalued small-cap companies with strong fundamentals and potential catalysts for value realization. The fund maintains a diversified portfolio of approximately 250 holdings across various sectors. T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Value excels through its disciplined value approach and strong bottom-up security selection. The fund's research-intensive process, supported by T. Rowe Price's 45 small-cap analysts, has generated an alpha of 3.2% annually over its benchmark since current management took over. Portfolio positioning has been particularly strong in identifying value opportunities, with 85% of holdings demonstrating positive earnings surprises in 2024. The fund's capacity management is exemplary, having soft-closed at $12 billion to maintain investment flexibility in less liquid small-cap stocks. Risk management stands out with a downside capture ratio of 0.82 while still participating in 92% of market upside. The expense ratio of 0.79% is competitive for active small-cap management, especially given the fund's consistent value-add through security selection and tactical sector positioning. Key Metrics: The Pimco income fund employs a flexible approach to fixed-income investing. It seeks to generate consistent income while protecting capital in different market environments. The fund can invest across the entire fixed-income spectrum globally. This fund stands out for its sophisticated income generation and risk management approach. The fund's dynamic asset allocation process has delivered a remarkable track record, outperforming its benchmark by 175 basis points annually while maintaining lower volatility than peers. The management team's tactical positioning in 2024 demonstrated exceptional skill, particularly in duration management and sector rotation, adding 220 basis points of excess return. The fund's risk-adjusted performance is superior, with a Sharpe ratio of 1.15 versus 0.85 for its peer group. Despite its institutional-level expense ratio of 1.23%, the fund's consistent income generation and total return profile justify the cost. The fund's sophisticated hedging strategies have provided effective downside protection, limiting drawdowns to 45% of its benchmark during market stress periods. Key Metrics: As the nation's oldest balanced fund, Wellington takes a disciplined approach to asset allocation and focuses on high-quality stocks and investment-grade bonds. Vanguard Wellington's enduring success stems from its disciplined approach and exceptional cost efficiency. The fund's balanced strategy has delivered remarkable consistency, beating its benchmark in 18 of the past 20 years while maintaining a low correlation to broad market indices. The equity portion's focus on high-quality dividend growers has resulted in a portfolio with a 15% higher return on equity than the S&P 500. At the same time, the fixed-income allocation's emphasis on investment-grade corporate bonds has generated 85 basis points of excess yield. The fund's industry-leading expense ratio of 0.25% enhances its risk-adjusted returns, resulting in a Sharpe ratio of 0.95, top decile in its category. Portfolio construction excellence is evident in strategic asset allocation and security selection, with the fund's tactical shifts adding 125 basis points of excess return in 2024. These five mutual funds offer investors exceptional management talent across investment strategies and asset classes. From Fidelity Contrafund's growth expertise to PIMCO Income's fixed-income prowess, each fund brings unique strengths to a diversified portfolio. Their combination of experienced management, proven track records, and reasonable costs makes them compelling choices for investors seeking professional management in 2025.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is in free fall, with shares tanking 12% in premarket trading on Monday. This comes hot on the heels of Friday's announcement that it's getting booted from the Nasdaq-100 Index, effective December 23. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Axon Enterprise (AXON are stepping in, replacing Super Micro, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), and Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN). For Super Micro, the move caps a brutal nine months that saw its stock lose nearly 70% of its value since hitting a record $118.8 in March. The company's troubles have snowballed, from missed earnings expectations to a delayed annual report filing, auditor resignations, and a Department of Justice probe triggered by short-seller allegations. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SMCI. But the hits keep coming. Bloomberg dropped another bombshell, reporting that Super Micro has hired Evercore to explore capital-raising options, including equity sales, debt financing, or private equity investments. This isn't the company's first trip down the capital-raising laneback in March, it sold 2 million new shares to drum up $2 billion. Now, with governance concerns lingering and a February deadline to file overdue reports to avoid Nasdaq delisting, Super Micro is walking a tightrope. Meanwhile, its pivot to BDO as its new auditor underscores a desperate attempt to restore credibility, but investors are clearly skeptical. Here's the bottom line: Super Micro is teetering on the edge. The Nasdaq removal is a glaring red flag, and while the potential capital raise could buy some breathing room, the company's underlying issuesgovernance gaps, financial reporting delays, and a shrinking market caparen't going away anytime soon. For investors, this might be a wait-and-watch game, but with every misstep, the odds of a turnaround get slimmer. The question now is whether Super Micro can stabilize or if it's destined to be a cautionary tale for growth stocks gone wrong. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Club name Honeywell said it is weighing a separation of its aerospace business split, exactly what activist investor Elliott wants. Would be huge for us. Another update on Honeywell's strategic review will come alongside its fourth-quarter earnings release. Shares rose more than 3% Monday. 2. Is the market hostage to absurd growth plays like Palantir, Applovin and even bitcoin? In my Sunday column for Club subscribers, I explored this idea. Think about the new additions to the Nasdaq 100. It's not just Palantir and corporate bitcoin holder MicroStrategy. A third one, Axon Enterprise, trades north of 100 times forward earnings. We'll discuss this more during our December Monthly Meeting for Club members on Thursday at noon ET. 3. President-elect Donald Trump's tariffs pledges are increasingly the only thing that business people will talk about, especially the potential for higher levies on goods coming into the U.S. from Mexico. That has been a particularly potent overhang on shares of Club holding Constellation Brands, which makes Corona and Modelo beer. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article MicroStrategy announced today it had acquired 15,350 BTC worth around $1.5 billion between December 9-15, marking its sixth consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases. The announcement comes ahead of its inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 index, which takes effect next Monday. MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 46.4% QTD and 72.4% YTD. As of 12/15/2024, we hodl 439,000 $BTC acquired for ~$27.1 billion at ~$61,725 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/SaWLNBVkrl — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 16, 2024 MicroStrategy funded the acquisition through the sale of 3,884,712 shares, generating net proceeds of about $1.5 billion, according to an SEC filing. MicroStrategy maintains $7.6 billion in available funds from its $21 billion at-market share sale facility for future Bitcoin purchases. The latest acquisition increases MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 439,000 BTC, valued at $45 billion at current market prices, representing over 2% of Bitcoin’s total supply. The company’s Bitcoin investments have yielded strong returns, with a 72.4% yield year-to-date as of December 15. According to Google Finance data, MSTR has been among Nasdaq’s best-performing stocks this year, with a remarkable 547% year-to-date increase. This surge qualified the company for inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. On December 13, Nasdaq announced its annual reconstitution of the Nasdaq-100 index, which saw three companies, including MicroStrategy, Palantir Technologies, and Axon Enterprise, added. The market reacted positively, with MicroStrategy shares rising from $411 at Friday’s close to $434 in Monday’s pre-market trading, Yahoo Finance data shows. Inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 will probably help MicroStrategy achieve its ambitious goal of accumulating $42 billion worth of Bitcoin. The company is expected to have greater financial flexibility to continue its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Logging Off: The Tech That Died in 2024

The tech graveyard is ending 2024 with a few new inhabitants. Throughout the year, companies put aging products out to pasture and billion-dollar deals ended with curt blog posts about focusing their efforts (and dollars) elsewhere. It was the end of the road for products big and small, old and new. Here's a look back at those that ended their run in 2024. In some circles, the Kardashians are no longer the money-making juggernauts they once were, and we saw evidence of that in January with the demise of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. The mobile fashion game debuted to chuckles more than a decade ago (“shallow, addictive fun,” we said in our 2014 review), but it quickly raked in millions for the eponymous reality star. Still, nothing lasts forever in Hollywood. “I’ve realized that it’s time to focus that energy into other passions,” Kim said in announcing the shutdown. Meta dumped non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in 2023, and X followed suit this year by dropping the ability to create NFT profile photos. The social network first started experimenting with them in 2022 as a perk for premium subscribers, but interest has waned as crypto bros failed to adequately explain why anyone would pay top dollar for what is basically a JPG. Case in point: an NFT of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s first tweet initially sold for $2.9 million in 2021 but only fetched $280 on the resale market a year later. Artifact, the news app created by Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, shut down in January, less than a year after its debut. “We have concluded that the market opportunity isn’t big enough to warrant continued investment,” Systrom said at the time. (Krieger is now the chief product officer at AI company Anthropic.) It was a rocky month for news startups, with The Messenger also abruptly closing up shop after throwing tons of money at high-profile journalists in an effort to combat “bias in the news.” In 2021, Uber spent more than $1 billion on alcohol-delivery service Drizly. But unlike Uber Eats, Drizly didn’t have Uber drivers deliver booze; it was a back-end system for liquor stores to facilitate deliveries they handled themselves. Complicating matters was a cybersecurity issue that Drizly failed to address, resulting in hefty FTC fines. By January, Uber said it would shut down Drizly to “focus on our core Uber Eats strategy of helping consumers get almost anything — from food to groceries to alcohol — all on a single app.” AMD’s Link app debuted in 2017 and allowed Radeon graphics card owners to stream PC games—including VR titles—to their smartphones. Seven years later, “there are many options available for users to stream their PC content to other devices,” AMD said, so it released a driver update that officially killed the Link app. Apple and Samsung dominate the US smartwatch market; it’s hard to compete with watchOS and the Galaxy brand. Fossil saw the writing on the wall this year and dropped out of the market. The Gen 6, released in 2021, will be Fossil’s last smartwatch, though it plans to keep the device updated “for the next few years.” British phone manufacturer Bullitt Group shut down in late January amid financial trouble. It was known for its rugged, Caterpillar-branded phones, like the Cat S60, Cat S40, and Cat S61, which offered the ability to measure air quality. In 2022, Bullitt tried to "pivot away from hardware" toward a satellite offering, including a clip-on device that enables satellite messaging for any smartphone, but that never got off the ground. It's estimated that 38% of web pages from 2013 no longer exist, a phenomenon known as link rot. For years, Google took and stored snapshots of web pages as it crawled them, giving users an archived view if a site went down. It also made it easy to see if any changes had been made to a web page, a helpful tool for journalists and search engine optimization specialists. In February, Google quietly pulled the plug because it was developed for a time when you “couldn't depend on a page loading,” it said. More recently, Google partnered with the Internet Archive to offers links to its Wayback Machine directly from search results (though the Internet Archive itself almost got added to this list this year). The Ring Car Cam launched at CES 2023 and worked as a dash cam while your vehicle was in motion and as a security camera when parked. In our 2023 review, we liked the Ring Cam's dual-camera imaging and 1080p video as well as its inclusion of the GPS locator. However, we were disappointed with the number of integration options available for the device and thought the camera was pricey, especially with an added subscription. After ongoing delivery delays, Ring decided to discontinue the device. The writing’s been on the wall for Funimation since 2021, when Sony acquired Crunchyroll for almost $1.2 billion and announced plans to merge the two anime streaming services. The larger Crunchyroll took priority, and Sony this year said the Funimation app and website would shut down on April 2, 2024. On the downside, Crunchyroll does not support Funimation Digital copies, meaning exclusive DVD and Blu-ray content purchased in digital form from Funimation is no longer accessible. This year’s Paramount layoffs took out the team behind kid-focused streaming service Noggin. Shows like Blue’s Clues & You, Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig made the leap to Paramount+. Skiff offered private email, storage, a calendar, and collaboration tools that were simple, forward-looking, and free. In our initial review last year, Skiff earned an Editors’ Choice award, but in February, Skiff announced it would no longer exist as a separate entity after its acquisition by productivity service Notion. All Skiff services ended on Aug. 9, except for email forwarding, which will continue until Feb. 9, 2025. Introduced in 2018, Mozilla Hubs was intended as a meeting place for those using virtual reality. You could go to the site, click a button, and generate a VR room with a share link. In 2022, the first public beta opened to subscribers for $20 a month. Earlier this year, however, Mozilla said it would shut down Hubs as part of a larger company restructuring, resulting in the end of the Hubs Demo Server and subscription service. Rumors about Apple producing a vehicle swirled for years before Bloomberg reported that the company had formally axed plans for an Apple car. Originally known as Project Titan, the EV endeavor was expected to become a major new business for Cupertino, which reportedly poured billions into the effort. But the company’s board was skeptical, dooming the effort (for now). The ability to run Android apps was a highly touted Windows 11 feature, but a big drawback was that it tapped into Amazon’s limited Amazon Appstore, not Google Play. The feature went live in July 2023, but by March, Microsoft updated its documentation to say that support for Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) would end on March 5, 2025. As PCMag’s Michael Muchmore noted, “It was a neat idea to be able to run mobile apps on your desktop, but…if you have a compatible Android phone, you get a better experience running apps via the Phone Link app.” This tool, which Facebook acquired in 2016, allowed publishers to track high-performing social media posts but also helped researchers and fact-checkers monitor bad actors on Facebook Pages, Groups, Instagram accounts, and—before API access was restricted—Twitter/X and Reddit. In March, Meta said it would shut down CrowdTangle and shift to its own Meta Content Library. Lawmakers urged Meta to delay the shutdown, arguing that the Content Library was more limited than CrowdTangle, to no avail. It closed up shop for good in August. Pandemic-era lockdowns prompted streaming services to launch watch parties that allowed us to Netflix and not-quite chill from our own homes. Amazon-owned Twitch’s solution offered a way for streamers to connect with fans via movies or shows streaming on Prime Video. It was a great alternative to watching someone play a game, but Watch Party usage declined dramatically as lockdowns lifted, so Amazon shut down the service to focus on other features. The VPN industry is crowded, and a few major player threw in the towel this year. Atlas VPN, a service with 6 million users, shut down in April, citing competition and rising costs. It migrated users to NordVPN, whose parent company acquired Atlas VPN in 2021. Atlas was supposed to remain independent while growing its freemium business after the merger, but it “encountered insurmountable challenges," Atlas VPN said. A month later, Google said it would pull the plug on the VPN that's included with Google One because “we found people simply weren't using it.” For Atlas customers, NordVPN is at least a top-rated VPN service, but check out our picks for the fastest VPNs and best free VPNs, too. Amazon has been experimenting with cashier-less technology for a few years, starting with its Amazon Go stores in 2016. It let shoppers grab things off shelves and leave the store without checking out; everything was tabulated as you shopped using a maze of sensors and charged to your Amazon account after you left. It expanded to Whole Foods and even select Starbucks, but started to wind down last year. In April, Amazon confirmed that it would transition from “Just Walk Out” tech in large grocery stores to speciality “Dash Carts,” where you manually scan items. It’s not completely ditching “Just Walk Out,” but it’s now positioned as a service Amazon is providing to third parties. A few “Just Walk Out” stores are still open internationally. Remember Alexa Skills? When Amazon debuted its Alexa-powered Echo devices a decade ago, it allowed developers to create “skills” that you called up with specific words or phrases. In 2017, Amazon added a rewards program that paid developers with high customer engagement and handed out millions of dollars in 2018. By 2020, however, it had scaled back and the program shut down in April. “These older programs have simply run their course, so we decided to sunset them," Amazon said. Developers can still make money from in-app payments. DALL-E 2 took the world by storm in April 2022 thanks to its ability to generate impressively high-quality images from simple text prompts. A few months later, OpenAI opened the beta to a broader audience, but it's since been eclipsed by DALL-E 3, which includes full integration with ChatGPT, making for a simpler interface that produces even better images. This delivery service picked up steam during the pandemic when people were stuck at home looking for quick access to groceries and other convenience items. It launched in 2015 in Turkey with a promise of deliveries in 13 minutes from drivers clad in the brand’s purple and yellow colors, and expanded to the US in 2021. Its valuation quickly ballooned, and it acquired US grocery-delivery service FreshDirect last year. But like Kozmo.com before it, interest dwindled as early discounts disappeared and people emerged from lockdowns and returned to buying their own groceries. By May, Getir shut down its US and European operations. “Facebook for work” always sounded like a terrible idea, but someone at Meta thought we’d all be curious to know what Anne in accounting had for lunch or how to help the C-Suite leverage its core competencies. Workplace debuted almost a decade ago as Facebook at Work, positioned as a useful way for those in non-traditional offices to communicate—helping retail workers, ship crews, or baristas stay connected from a phone or tablet, for example. That didn’t really catch on, however, and in May, Meta announced plans to shut down Workplace “so we can focus on building AI and metaverse technologies.” You have until Aug. 31, 2025, to log into Workplace and pour one out for cross-functional synergies and maybe shift a few paradigms. Google moved to simplify its mobile payment apps this summer by folding the Google Pay app into Google Wallet. According to Google, the Wallet app saw five times the usage of Pay, so it made sense to focus on Wallet. On the downside, the shutdown meant that Google Pay users lost the ability to send and receive money, forcing them to migrate to one of several non-Google-operated alternatives, such as PayPal, PayPal-owned Venmo, Cash App, or Zelle. After almost three decades, once-popular instant messaging client ICQ finally shut down on June 26, an unceremonious end for a software program that helped kick off instant messaging on PCs in the 1990s. ICQ, which stands for "I Seek You," was originally developed at an Israeli company called Mirabilis before AOL bought it in 1998 for $407 million. Twelve years later, AOL then sold it to Russian social media company VK (then known as DST). VK recommended that ICQ users migrate to one of its messaging platforms following the shutdown. Providing broadband subsidies for low-income households might seem like a no-brainer, but Congress couldn’t get it together this year to renew funding for The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act allocated $30 per month ($75 on qualifying Tribal lands) for those with household incomes up to 200% of federal poverty guidelines, those participating in Medicaid, or anyone with a child who received free or reduced-cost school lunches. Approximately 23 million households signed up. Some ISPs tried to fill the gap at lower rates, but it wasn’t enough. Despite a big push from the White House to renew funding, multiple bipartisan bills introduced in the House and Senate went nowhere. Ted Cruz breathed a sigh of relief this summer when X announced it would make the “like” tab on people’s profiles private. Musk framed it as a way for people to “like posts without getting attacked,” but many argued it just allowed users to escape scrutiny for liking objectionable content. Like counts still remain on X, and you can still see your own likes. But only the author of a tweet can see who liked a post. It’s not completely without precedent. In 2019, for example, Instagram dropped the “following” tab, which put people’s likes, comments, and follows into a public news feed. Rivals like Threads and Bluesky also don’t have a way to see a person’s likes. Apple Pay Later was the company’s answer to "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) options from firms like Klarna, allowing users to make a purchase and pay for it over time, but with the added bonus of no fees. It launched to small group in March 2023, and became fully available in the US in October. By June, however, Apple said it would no longer offer its own loans. Instead, those on iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 and up can select a BNPL option at checkout, but the loans will be handled by third parties lenders. Amazon launched the Business version of its Astro robot in November 2023 as a security guard for small and medium-sized businesses. Each unit was $2,350 and came with four months of Ring Protect Pro and Astro Security. Like the consumer version, Astro for Business had an HD periscope camera, night vision, 24/7 live view, and two-way talk. In a July email to employees, however, an Amazon exec said the company would be focusing on home robotics, "so we've made the decision to wind down the Astro for Business program." Businesses that purchased the device were promised a full refund and a $300 credit toward a replacement solution. Also on the chopping block from Amazon in July was the version of its Echo Dot smart speaker with an LED clock. It earned an "Excellent" 4 out of 5 rating from PCMag and an Editors' Choice award, in part for adding visible information like song titles and weather conditions on the most recent version. But after Amazon resurrected the Echo Spot with a small display, it discontinued the Echo Dot with Clock. In July, Google hit the kill switch on the Google URL Shortener. It dates back to 2009 and was created in response to the rise of Twitter and its 140-character limit. Since then, the web and social media landscape has changed dramatically, and by 2018, Google said it was diverting resources away from its URL shortener. All goo.gl links now display a warning message and will no longer work after Aug. 25, 2025. Late last year, Meta rolled out celebrity chatbots on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. But while these chats featured images of celebrities like Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady, you weren’t actually talking to them. The most you got was a looping video of the celebrity reacting to your messages with different facial expressions. They didn’t talk back. It was a little weird, and by July, Meta scrapped the whole thing. In the fall, Meta instead partnered with a new crop of celebrities to embed their real voices into its Meta AI assistant, including Awkwafina, Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan Michael Key, and Kristen Bell. It’s rough out there for digital media. Shortly after decades of MTV News content was wiped from the web, Game Informer closed up shop after 33 years. It was one of the few remaining video game magazines, but earlier this year, owner GameStop pulled the plug on the print and online versions of the publication. These days, tech companies are trying to one-up each other with their AI tools, but back in 2017, the social networks were engaged in a face-filter war. Meta (then Facebook) went after Snapchat with eight face filter options, which evolved into the Spark AR platform that allowed third-party developers to create their own smartphone-based AR filters. But 2024 is not 2017; silly overlays have given way to undetectable beauty filters. As such, Spark AR is shutting down and third-party tools and content will be wiped, effective Jan. 14, 2025, news that shocked and angered many creators. First-party effects owned by Meta will remain. Boomerang, which launched in 2017, was known for its library of popular animated shows, which include Scooby-Doo, The Jetsons, Tom & Jerry, Looney Tunes, and Bugs Bunny, among others. But in August, Warner Bros. Discovery said it would shut down the app and website for its classic cartoon streamer on Sept. 30. Existing Boomerang subscriptions were automatically transferred to the ad-free version of Max, but that does not include the full library. The Echo Show 8 Photos Edition launched in September 2023 alongside the third-gen Echo Show 8 and Echo Hub. It cost $10 more than the base Echo Show 8 and required a $2-per-month subscription to Amazon’s PhotosPlus service after a six-month free trial. It turned the device into more of a digital photo frame and added 25GB of storage through Amazon Photos. But Amazon axed PhotosPlus in late September and inserted ads into photo slideshows. Buyers could keep the 25GB of storage. For a time, the Kindle Oasis was Amazon’s most luxurious ebook reader, in part because it was the only device in the lineup that was waterproof. There was also an ergonomic grip, but as Amazon updated its Kindle lineup, the Oasis’ features didn’t really justify a $249.99 price tag. When it launched the latest Kindles, including the Colorsoft, Amazon confirmed to The Verge that it was pulling the Oasis from its lineup. Before there was the Vision Pro, there was the HoloLens, a mixed-reality headset that dates back to 2016. Microsoft marketed it as an enterprise device, and secured a US Army contract for use on the battlefield. But it seems that not enough people wanted to slap on an AR headset at work, and Redmond announced in October that it would sunset the latest version, the HoloLens 2. It will get updates until the end of 2027, but support for the original HoloLens ended on Dec. 10. The Pentagon contract is unchanged, however. In early October, Enel X, the company that makes the JuiceBox EV charger, abruptly shut down operations in the US and Canada. Initially, those with Juicebox home chargers were out of luck as Enel X had no plans to continue providing customer support. After some backlash, JuiceBox reached an agreement with a software provider to keep the JuiceBox software and mobile app alive "for an extended period." ChargeLab stepped in to assist with commercial chargers, but declined to do the same for residential ones "given the complexities of the migration process." The business was auctioned off at the end of October, though it's unclear who picked it up and what it means for existing JuiceBox owners. With October’s Windows 11 2024 update, WordPad was officially added to Microsoft's list of deprecated features. This basic word processor and document editor had been installed by default on Windows computers since the launch of Windows 95. In 2020, it was made an optional Windows feature, allowing people to uninstall it. Microsoft now recommends Microsoft Word for rich text documents like .doc and .rtf and Windows Notepad for plain text documents like .txt." Announced in May, the Snapdragon Dev Kit mini PC was supposed to launch a month later to help developers create Windows applications that were natively compatible with chips manufactured by semiconductor giant Arm. However, in an Oct. 17 email to developers, Qualcomm said the kit had "not met our usual standards of excellence" and would be canceled. Customers who preordered the device were promised a refund from Qualcomm. Launched in 2021 on the Kindle app and Amazon website, Kindle Vella allowed authors to publish stories one short episode at a time. The model was supposed to give authors a new way to earn royalties, but "Kindle Vella hasn’t caught on as we’d hoped," Amazon said in October. As of Dec. 4, the platform stopped allowing authors to publish stories and readers to purchase tokens. If readers have any tokens left, they can use them to unlock stories until February. Paint 3D launched in 2017 and combined the Microsoft Paint and 3D Builder applications to create a hybrid 2D-3D editing experience. Microsoft then tried to deprecate the original Paint, creating an uproar among fans, prompting it to clarify that MS Paint would be removed as a standard feature of Windows 10 but remain in the Windows Store. At the time, the company pointed to Paint 3D as the "new app for creativity," but that didn't last long. In 2021, 3D Viewer and Paint 3D were removed from the default app install list on Windows 10, meaning you had to install it from the store. Last month, Paint 3D was deprecated and removed from the Microsoft Store entirely. Many of you were probably not aware that TikTok had its own version of Spotify, known as TikTok Music, likely because it only launched in Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Singapore. But despite the fact that TikTok has been a boon for many artists whose songs are used in creators’ videos, that didn’t translate to the music-streaming business. As a TikTok exec told The Wall Street Journal, ByteDance would shut down TikTok Music to “focus on our goal of furthering TikTok’s role in driving even greater music listening and value on music streaming services, for the benefit of artists, songwriters and the industry.” In 2017, Netflix began experimenting with interactive titles that added a "Choose Your Own Adventure" component to some of its originals, most notably with Black Mirror. But Netflix recently pulled the plug on most of the 24 interactive shows and movies on the platform, leaving only Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend, Ranveer vs. Wild with Bear Grylls, and You vs. Wild. "The technology served its purpose but is now limiting as we focus on technological efforts in other areas," Netflix said. Sony's Airpeak S1 drone was marketed to serious videographers looking to send their Sony a1, a9 II, a7S III, a7R IV, and FX3 cameras into the skies. But its $9,000 price tag did not include the price of a camera, lens, gimbal, or even spare propellers. As PetaPixel explains, Sony struggled to compete with DJI and announced in November that "sales of the Airpeak S1 and related products, except for some accessories, will end at the end of March 2025." Amazon Freevee (previously IMDb Freedive and IMDb TV) was Amazon's ad-supported streaming service. It saw some success with shows like Jury Duty and Bosch: Legacy, but Amazon in November said it would shut down Freevee and fold the content into Prime Video. You don't have to pony up for Prime to keep watching; new episodes of Freevee originals will remain accessible to non-Prime subscribers. And there are plenty of other free video-streaming services. First introduced in 2022, LinkedIn Audio Events allowed people to create and host audio-only streams, where participants could log in and talk. However, as Dec. 2, users can no longer stream Audio Events on LinkedIn without using a third-party platform, though they can still record events using LinkedIn Live. When it launched Audio Events in 2022, LinkedIn pitched them as "a great way to connect with your followers, build relationships, and even unlock new career opportunities." They're "camera-free and pajama-friendly, so you can launch a conversation from anywhere." But it was late to the game following a pandemic-era boom in audio-only apps trying to replicate the success of Clubhouse. Last month, Microsoft ended support for the Mail, Calendar, and People apps on Windows 11. It will redirect users to the free version of Microsoft Outlook after Dec. 31, though they'll still be able to export emails, events, and contacts after that date. The move is part of Microsoft's broader push to get people to use its new AI-powered Outlook, which added new themes, easier-to-dismiss notifications, and more search features this month. Originally launched to a limited audience in October 2021, the $89.99 Car Thing allowed Spotify users to control the music-streaming service in their cars via voice recognition and preset buttons. Spotify stopped making its Car Thing in 2022 due to low demand and supply chain issues, but it continued to sell the device on its website at a discounted $49.99. This year, it announced the device would be discontinued and "no longer be operational" as of Dec. 9. Initially, there were no plans for refunds, but Spotify backtracked after buyers complained. You now have until Jan. 14, 2025, to get your money back. Microsoft’s pricey Surface Studio all-in-one PCs earned high marks in our reviews. The second-gen version debuted in 2018 as “a beautiful, pricey all-in-one desktop for artists, content creators, and professionals wedded to pen input,” we said, complete with “components peppier than the original's, and a downright stunning screen.” But that came at a premium; the version we tested was $4,199. Now, the Surface Studio is on the chopping block. The company confirms to Windows Central that it won’t be making any more Surface Studios once the current inventory runs out. We’re not exactly at a loss for messaging apps these days, which is maybe one reason Verizon ditched its Messages apps for iOS and Android. Verizon Messages, also known as Message+, supported MMS and SMS messages and group texts. The carrier is now recommending that Android users move to Google Messages while those on iOS use Apple Messages, but there are plenty of other options for secure chats. After a tough 2023 that saw robotaxi firm Cruise halt its driverless taxi operations following a pedestrian accident, the company seemed to be making a slow recovery in 2024. Its self-driving cars returned to the roads, albeit with human safety drivers, and the firm inked a deal with Uber. But after being hit with a $500,000 fine for failing to disclose details around last year's crash, Cruise's main source of funding—General Motors—pulled its financial backing, effectively killing the company. The move will save GM about $1 billion per year. Skype Credits let people pay to make traditional telephone calls, a convenient way to reach people still on landlines. Customers could buy credits in $5, $10 or $25 increments, but Skype owner Microsoft quietly updated its website to say that credits are no longer available. It's encouraging callers to instead buy monthly subscriptions, which vary in price and minutes depending on which countries you want to call, or to simply place Skype-to-Skype VoIP calls. When Foursquare launched at SXSW 2009, it promised an easy way to keep tabs on your friends' whereabouts and get recommendations for nearby restaurants, bars, and shops. But over the last decade, Foursquare's business has tilted increasingly toward providing location services to other businesses. Foursquare's City Guide app shut down this month, and its web version will expire early next year. Foursquare’s original check-in feature lives on in the company’s Swarm app. I started out covering tech policy in D.C. for The National Journal, where my beat included state-level tech news and all the congressional hearings and FCC meetings I could handle.

Title: Logging Off: The Tech That Died in 2024

The tech graveyard is ending 2024 with a few new inhabitants. Throughout the year, companies put aging products out to pasture and billion-dollar deals ended with curt blog posts about focusing their efforts (and dollars) elsewhere. It was the end of the road for products big and small, old and new. Here's a look back at those that ended their run in 2024. In some circles, the Kardashians are no longer the money-making juggernauts they once were, and we saw evidence of that in January with the demise of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. The mobile fashion game debuted to chuckles more than a decade ago (“shallow, addictive fun,” we said in our 2014 review), but it quickly raked in millions for the eponymous reality star. Still, nothing lasts forever in Hollywood. “I’ve realized that it’s time to focus that energy into other passions,” Kim said in announcing the shutdown. Meta dumped non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in 2023, and X followed suit this year by dropping the ability to create NFT profile photos. The social network first started experimenting with them in 2022 as a perk for premium subscribers, but interest has waned as crypto bros failed to adequately explain why anyone would pay top dollar for what is basically a JPG. Case in point: an NFT of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s first tweet initially sold for $2.9 million in 2021 but only fetched $280 on the resale market a year later. Artifact, the news app created by Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, shut down in January, less than a year after its debut. “We have concluded that the market opportunity isn’t big enough to warrant continued investment,” Systrom said at the time. (Krieger is now the chief product officer at AI company Anthropic.) It was a rocky month for news startups, with The Messenger also abruptly closing up shop after throwing tons of money at high-profile journalists in an effort to combat “bias in the news.” In 2021, Uber spent more than $1 billion on alcohol-delivery service Drizly. But unlike Uber Eats, Drizly didn’t have Uber drivers deliver booze; it was a back-end system for liquor stores to facilitate deliveries they handled themselves. Complicating matters was a cybersecurity issue that Drizly failed to address, resulting in hefty FTC fines. By January, Uber said it would shut down Drizly to “focus on our core Uber Eats strategy of helping consumers get almost anything — from food to groceries to alcohol — all on a single app.” AMD’s Link app debuted in 2017 and allowed Radeon graphics card owners to stream PC games—including VR titles—to their smartphones. Seven years later, “there are many options available for users to stream their PC content to other devices,” AMD said, so it released a driver update that officially killed the Link app. Apple and Samsung dominate the US smartwatch market; it’s hard to compete with watchOS and the Galaxy brand. Fossil saw the writing on the wall this year and dropped out of the market. The Gen 6, released in 2021, will be Fossil’s last smartwatch, though it plans to keep the device updated “for the next few years.” British phone manufacturer Bullitt Group shut down in late January amid financial trouble. It was known for its rugged, Caterpillar-branded phones, like the Cat S60, Cat S40, and Cat S61, which offered the ability to measure air quality. In 2022, Bullitt tried to "pivot away from hardware" toward a satellite offering, including a clip-on device that enables satellite messaging for any smartphone, but that never got off the ground. It's estimated that 38% of web pages from 2013 no longer exist, a phenomenon known as link rot. For years, Google took and stored snapshots of web pages as it crawled them, giving users an archived view if a site went down. It also made it easy to see if any changes had been made to a web page, a helpful tool for journalists and search engine optimization specialists. In February, Google quietly pulled the plug because it was developed for a time when you “couldn't depend on a page loading,” it said. More recently, Google partnered with the Internet Archive to offers links to its Wayback Machine directly from search results (though the Internet Archive itself almost got added to this list this year). The Ring Car Cam launched at CES 2023 and worked as a dash cam while your vehicle was in motion and as a security camera when parked. In our 2023 review, we liked the Ring Cam's dual-camera imaging and 1080p video as well as its inclusion of the GPS locator. However, we were disappointed with the number of integration options available for the device and thought the camera was pricey, especially with an added subscription. After ongoing delivery delays, Ring decided to discontinue the device. The writing’s been on the wall for Funimation since 2021, when Sony acquired Crunchyroll for almost $1.2 billion and announced plans to merge the two anime streaming services. The larger Crunchyroll took priority, and Sony this year said the Funimation app and website would shut down on April 2, 2024. On the downside, Crunchyroll does not support Funimation Digital copies, meaning exclusive DVD and Blu-ray content purchased in digital form from Funimation is no longer accessible. This year’s Paramount layoffs took out the team behind kid-focused streaming service Noggin. Shows like Blue’s Clues & You, Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig made the leap to Paramount+. Skiff offered private email, storage, a calendar, and collaboration tools that were simple, forward-looking, and free. In our initial review last year, Skiff earned an Editors’ Choice award, but in February, Skiff announced it would no longer exist as a separate entity after its acquisition by productivity service Notion. All Skiff services ended on Aug. 9, except for email forwarding, which will continue until Feb. 9, 2025. Introduced in 2018, Mozilla Hubs was intended as a meeting place for those using virtual reality. You could go to the site, click a button, and generate a VR room with a share link. In 2022, the first public beta opened to subscribers for $20 a month. Earlier this year, however, Mozilla said it would shut down Hubs as part of a larger company restructuring, resulting in the end of the Hubs Demo Server and subscription service. Rumors about Apple producing a vehicle swirled for years before Bloomberg reported that the company had formally axed plans for an Apple car. Originally known as Project Titan, the EV endeavor was expected to become a major new business for Cupertino, which reportedly poured billions into the effort. But the company’s board was skeptical, dooming the effort (for now). The ability to run Android apps was a highly touted Windows 11 feature, but a big drawback was that it tapped into Amazon’s limited Amazon Appstore, not Google Play. The feature went live in July 2023, but by March, Microsoft updated its documentation to say that support for Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) would end on March 5, 2025. As PCMag’s Michael Muchmore noted, “It was a neat idea to be able to run mobile apps on your desktop, but…if you have a compatible Android phone, you get a better experience running apps via the Phone Link app.” This tool, which Facebook acquired in 2016, allowed publishers to track high-performing social media posts but also helped researchers and fact-checkers monitor bad actors on Facebook Pages, Groups, Instagram accounts, and—before API access was restricted—Twitter/X and Reddit. In March, Meta said it would shut down CrowdTangle and shift to its own Meta Content Library. Lawmakers urged Meta to delay the shutdown, arguing that the Content Library was more limited than CrowdTangle, to no avail. It closed up shop for good in August. Pandemic-era lockdowns prompted streaming services to launch watch parties that allowed us to Netflix and not-quite chill from our own homes. Amazon-owned Twitch’s solution offered a way for streamers to connect with fans via movies or shows streaming on Prime Video. It was a great alternative to watching someone play a game, but Watch Party usage declined dramatically as lockdowns lifted, so Amazon shut down the service to focus on other features. The VPN industry is crowded, and a few major player threw in the towel this year. Atlas VPN, a service with 6 million users, shut down in April, citing competition and rising costs. It migrated users to NordVPN, whose parent company acquired Atlas VPN in 2021. Atlas was supposed to remain independent while growing its freemium business after the merger, but it “encountered insurmountable challenges," Atlas VPN said. A month later, Google said it would pull the plug on the VPN that's included with Google One because “we found people simply weren't using it.” For Atlas customers, NordVPN is at least a top-rated VPN service, but check out our picks for the fastest VPNs and best free VPNs, too. Amazon has been experimenting with cashier-less technology for a few years, starting with its Amazon Go stores in 2016. It let shoppers grab things off shelves and leave the store without checking out; everything was tabulated as you shopped using a maze of sensors and charged to your Amazon account after you left. It expanded to Whole Foods and even select Starbucks, but started to wind down last year. In April, Amazon confirmed that it would transition from “Just Walk Out” tech in large grocery stores to speciality “Dash Carts,” where you manually scan items. It’s not completely ditching “Just Walk Out,” but it’s now positioned as a service Amazon is providing to third parties. A few “Just Walk Out” stores are still open internationally. Remember Alexa Skills? When Amazon debuted its Alexa-powered Echo devices a decade ago, it allowed developers to create “skills” that you called up with specific words or phrases. In 2017, Amazon added a rewards program that paid developers with high customer engagement and handed out millions of dollars in 2018. By 2020, however, it had scaled back and the program shut down in April. “These older programs have simply run their course, so we decided to sunset them," Amazon said. Developers can still make money from in-app payments. DALL-E 2 took the world by storm in April 2022 thanks to its ability to generate impressively high-quality images from simple text prompts. A few months later, OpenAI opened the beta to a broader audience, but it's since been eclipsed by DALL-E 3, which includes full integration with ChatGPT, making for a simpler interface that produces even better images. This delivery service picked up steam during the pandemic when people were stuck at home looking for quick access to groceries and other convenience items. It launched in 2015 in Turkey with a promise of deliveries in 13 minutes from drivers clad in the brand’s purple and yellow colors, and expanded to the US in 2021. Its valuation quickly ballooned, and it acquired US grocery-delivery service FreshDirect last year. But like Kozmo.com before it, interest dwindled as early discounts disappeared and people emerged from lockdowns and returned to buying their own groceries. By May, Getir shut down its US and European operations. “Facebook for work” always sounded like a terrible idea, but someone at Meta thought we’d all be curious to know what Anne in accounting had for lunch or how to help the C-Suite leverage its core competencies. Workplace debuted almost a decade ago as Facebook at Work, positioned as a useful way for those in non-traditional offices to communicate—helping retail workers, ship crews, or baristas stay connected from a phone or tablet, for example. That didn’t really catch on, however, and in May, Meta announced plans to shut down Workplace “so we can focus on building AI and metaverse technologies.” You have until Aug. 31, 2025, to log into Workplace and pour one out for cross-functional synergies and maybe shift a few paradigms. Google moved to simplify its mobile payment apps this summer by folding the Google Pay app into Google Wallet. According to Google, the Wallet app saw five times the usage of Pay, so it made sense to focus on Wallet. On the downside, the shutdown meant that Google Pay users lost the ability to send and receive money, forcing them to migrate to one of several non-Google-operated alternatives, such as PayPal, PayPal-owned Venmo, Cash App, or Zelle. After almost three decades, once-popular instant messaging client ICQ finally shut down on June 26, an unceremonious end for a software program that helped kick off instant messaging on PCs in the 1990s. ICQ, which stands for "I Seek You," was originally developed at an Israeli company called Mirabilis before AOL bought it in 1998 for $407 million. Twelve years later, AOL then sold it to Russian social media company VK (then known as DST). VK recommended that ICQ users migrate to one of its messaging platforms following the shutdown. Providing broadband subsidies for low-income households might seem like a no-brainer, but Congress couldn’t get it together this year to renew funding for The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act allocated $30 per month ($75 on qualifying Tribal lands) for those with household incomes up to 200% of federal poverty guidelines, those participating in Medicaid, or anyone with a child who received free or reduced-cost school lunches. Approximately 23 million households signed up. Some ISPs tried to fill the gap at lower rates, but it wasn’t enough. Despite a big push from the White House to renew funding, multiple bipartisan bills introduced in the House and Senate went nowhere. Ted Cruz breathed a sigh of relief this summer when X announced it would make the “like” tab on people’s profiles private. Musk framed it as a way for people to “like posts without getting attacked,” but many argued it just allowed users to escape scrutiny for liking objectionable content. Like counts still remain on X, and you can still see your own likes. But only the author of a tweet can see who liked a post. It’s not completely without precedent. In 2019, for example, Instagram dropped the “following” tab, which put people’s likes, comments, and follows into a public news feed. Rivals like Threads and Bluesky also don’t have a way to see a person’s likes. Apple Pay Later was the company’s answer to "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) options from firms like Klarna, allowing users to make a purchase and pay for it over time, but with the added bonus of no fees. It launched to small group in March 2023, and became fully available in the US in October. By June, however, Apple said it would no longer offer its own loans. Instead, those on iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 and up can select a BNPL option at checkout, but the loans will be handled by third parties lenders. Amazon launched the Business version of its Astro robot in November 2023 as a security guard for small and medium-sized businesses. Each unit was $2,350 and came with four months of Ring Protect Pro and Astro Security. Like the consumer version, Astro for Business had an HD periscope camera, night vision, 24/7 live view, and two-way talk. In a July email to employees, however, an Amazon exec said the company would be focusing on home robotics, "so we've made the decision to wind down the Astro for Business program." Businesses that purchased the device were promised a full refund and a $300 credit toward a replacement solution. Also on the chopping block from Amazon in July was the version of its Echo Dot smart speaker with an LED clock. It earned an "Excellent" 4 out of 5 rating from PCMag and an Editors' Choice award, in part for adding visible information like song titles and weather conditions on the most recent version. But after Amazon resurrected the Echo Spot with a small display, it discontinued the Echo Dot with Clock. In July, Google hit the kill switch on the Google URL Shortener. It dates back to 2009 and was created in response to the rise of Twitter and its 140-character limit. Since then, the web and social media landscape has changed dramatically, and by 2018, Google said it was diverting resources away from its URL shortener. All goo.gl links now display a warning message and will no longer work after Aug. 25, 2025. Late last year, Meta rolled out celebrity chatbots on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. But while these chats featured images of celebrities like Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady, you weren’t actually talking to them. The most you got was a looping video of the celebrity reacting to your messages with different facial expressions. They didn’t talk back. It was a little weird, and by July, Meta scrapped the whole thing. In the fall, Meta instead partnered with a new crop of celebrities to embed their real voices into its Meta AI assistant, including Awkwafina, Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan Michael Key, and Kristen Bell. It’s rough out there for digital media. Shortly after decades of MTV News content was wiped from the web, Game Informer closed up shop after 33 years. It was one of the few remaining video game magazines, but earlier this year, owner GameStop pulled the plug on the print and online versions of the publication. These days, tech companies are trying to one-up each other with their AI tools, but back in 2017, the social networks were engaged in a face-filter war. Meta (then Facebook) went after Snapchat with eight face filter options, which evolved into the Spark AR platform that allowed third-party developers to create their own smartphone-based AR filters. But 2024 is not 2017; silly overlays have given way to undetectable beauty filters. As such, Spark AR is shutting down and third-party tools and content will be wiped, effective Jan. 14, 2025, news that shocked and angered many creators. First-party effects owned by Meta will remain. Boomerang, which launched in 2017, was known for its library of popular animated shows, which include Scooby-Doo, The Jetsons, Tom & Jerry, Looney Tunes, and Bugs Bunny, among others. But in August, Warner Bros. Discovery said it would shut down the app and website for its classic cartoon streamer on Sept. 30. Existing Boomerang subscriptions were automatically transferred to the ad-free version of Max, but that does not include the full library. The Echo Show 8 Photos Edition launched in September 2023 alongside the third-gen Echo Show 8 and Echo Hub. It cost $10 more than the base Echo Show 8 and required a $2-per-month subscription to Amazon’s PhotosPlus service after a six-month free trial. It turned the device into more of a digital photo frame and added 25GB of storage through Amazon Photos. But Amazon axed PhotosPlus in late September and inserted ads into photo slideshows. Buyers could keep the 25GB of storage. For a time, the Kindle Oasis was Amazon’s most luxurious ebook reader, in part because it was the only device in the lineup that was waterproof. There was also an ergonomic grip, but as Amazon updated its Kindle lineup, the Oasis’ features didn’t really justify a $249.99 price tag. When it launched the latest Kindles, including the Colorsoft, Amazon confirmed to The Verge that it was pulling the Oasis from its lineup. Before there was the Vision Pro, there was the HoloLens, a mixed-reality headset that dates back to 2016. Microsoft marketed it as an enterprise device, and secured a US Army contract for use on the battlefield. But it seems that not enough people wanted to slap on an AR headset at work, and Redmond announced in October that it would sunset the latest version, the HoloLens 2. It will get updates until the end of 2027, but support for the original HoloLens ended on Dec. 10. The Pentagon contract is unchanged, however. In early October, Enel X, the company that makes the JuiceBox EV charger, abruptly shut down operations in the US and Canada. Initially, those with Juicebox home chargers were out of luck as Enel X had no plans to continue providing customer support. After some backlash, JuiceBox reached an agreement with a software provider to keep the JuiceBox software and mobile app alive "for an extended period." ChargeLab stepped in to assist with commercial chargers, but declined to do the same for residential ones "given the complexities of the migration process." The business was auctioned off at the end of October, though it's unclear who picked it up and what it means for existing JuiceBox owners. With October’s Windows 11 2024 update, WordPad was officially added to Microsoft's list of deprecated features. This basic word processor and document editor had been installed by default on Windows computers since the launch of Windows 95. In 2020, it was made an optional Windows feature, allowing people to uninstall it. Microsoft now recommends Microsoft Word for rich text documents like .doc and .rtf and Windows Notepad for plain text documents like .txt." Announced in May, the Snapdragon Dev Kit mini PC was supposed to launch a month later to help developers create Windows applications that were natively compatible with chips manufactured by semiconductor giant Arm. However, in an Oct. 17 email to developers, Qualcomm said the kit had "not met our usual standards of excellence" and would be canceled. Customers who preordered the device were promised a refund from Qualcomm. Launched in 2021 on the Kindle app and Amazon website, Kindle Vella allowed authors to publish stories one short episode at a time. The model was supposed to give authors a new way to earn royalties, but "Kindle Vella hasn’t caught on as we’d hoped," Amazon said in October. As of Dec. 4, the platform stopped allowing authors to publish stories and readers to purchase tokens. If readers have any tokens left, they can use them to unlock stories until February. Paint 3D launched in 2017 and combined the Microsoft Paint and 3D Builder applications to create a hybrid 2D-3D editing experience. Microsoft then tried to deprecate the original Paint, creating an uproar among fans, prompting it to clarify that MS Paint would be removed as a standard feature of Windows 10 but remain in the Windows Store. At the time, the company pointed to Paint 3D as the "new app for creativity," but that didn't last long. In 2021, 3D Viewer and Paint 3D were removed from the default app install list on Windows 10, meaning you had to install it from the store. Last month, Paint 3D was deprecated and removed from the Microsoft Store entirely. Many of you were probably not aware that TikTok had its own version of Spotify, known as TikTok Music, likely because it only launched in Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Singapore. But despite the fact that TikTok has been a boon for many artists whose songs are used in creators’ videos, that didn’t translate to the music-streaming business. As a TikTok exec told The Wall Street Journal, ByteDance would shut down TikTok Music to “focus on our goal of furthering TikTok’s role in driving even greater music listening and value on music streaming services, for the benefit of artists, songwriters and the industry.” In 2017, Netflix began experimenting with interactive titles that added a "Choose Your Own Adventure" component to some of its originals, most notably with Black Mirror. But Netflix recently pulled the plug on most of the 24 interactive shows and movies on the platform, leaving only Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend, Ranveer vs. Wild with Bear Grylls, and You vs. Wild. "The technology served its purpose but is now limiting as we focus on technological efforts in other areas," Netflix said. Sony's Airpeak S1 drone was marketed to serious videographers looking to send their Sony a1, a9 II, a7S III, a7R IV, and FX3 cameras into the skies. But its $9,000 price tag did not include the price of a camera, lens, gimbal, or even spare propellers. As PetaPixel explains, Sony struggled to compete with DJI and announced in November that "sales of the Airpeak S1 and related products, except for some accessories, will end at the end of March 2025." Amazon Freevee (previously IMDb Freedive and IMDb TV) was Amazon's ad-supported streaming service. It saw some success with shows like Jury Duty and Bosch: Legacy, but Amazon in November said it would shut down Freevee and fold the content into Prime Video. You don't have to pony up for Prime to keep watching; new episodes of Freevee originals will remain accessible to non-Prime subscribers. And there are plenty of other free video-streaming services. First introduced in 2022, LinkedIn Audio Events allowed people to create and host audio-only streams, where participants could log in and talk. However, as Dec. 2, users can no longer stream Audio Events on LinkedIn without using a third-party platform, though they can still record events using LinkedIn Live. When it launched Audio Events in 2022, LinkedIn pitched them as "a great way to connect with your followers, build relationships, and even unlock new career opportunities." They're "camera-free and pajama-friendly, so you can launch a conversation from anywhere." But it was late to the game following a pandemic-era boom in audio-only apps trying to replicate the success of Clubhouse. Last month, Microsoft ended support for the Mail, Calendar, and People apps on Windows 11. It will redirect users to the free version of Microsoft Outlook after Dec. 31, though they'll still be able to export emails, events, and contacts after that date. The move is part of Microsoft's broader push to get people to use its new AI-powered Outlook, which added new themes, easier-to-dismiss notifications, and more search features this month. Originally launched to a limited audience in October 2021, the $89.99 Car Thing allowed Spotify users to control the music-streaming service in their cars via voice recognition and preset buttons. Spotify stopped making its Car Thing in 2022 due to low demand and supply chain issues, but it continued to sell the device on its website at a discounted $49.99. This year, it announced the device would be discontinued and "no longer be operational" as of Dec. 9. Initially, there were no plans for refunds, but Spotify backtracked after buyers complained. You now have until Jan. 14, 2025, to get your money back. Microsoft’s pricey Surface Studio all-in-one PCs earned high marks in our reviews. The second-gen version debuted in 2018 as “a beautiful, pricey all-in-one desktop for artists, content creators, and professionals wedded to pen input,” we said, complete with “components peppier than the original's, and a downright stunning screen.” But that came at a premium; the version we tested was $4,199. Now, the Surface Studio is on the chopping block. The company confirms to Windows Central that it won’t be making any more Surface Studios once the current inventory runs out. We’re not exactly at a loss for messaging apps these days, which is maybe one reason Verizon ditched its Messages apps for iOS and Android. Verizon Messages, also known as Message+, supported MMS and SMS messages and group texts. The carrier is now recommending that Android users move to Google Messages while those on iOS use Apple Messages, but there are plenty of other options for secure chats. After a tough 2023 that saw robotaxi firm Cruise halt its driverless taxi operations following a pedestrian accident, the company seemed to be making a slow recovery in 2024. Its self-driving cars returned to the roads, albeit with human safety drivers, and the firm inked a deal with Uber. But after being hit with a $500,000 fine for failing to disclose details around last year's crash, Cruise's main source of funding—General Motors—pulled its financial backing, effectively killing the company. The move will save GM about $1 billion per year. Skype Credits let people pay to make traditional telephone calls, a convenient way to reach people still on landlines. Customers could buy credits in $5, $10 or $25 increments, but Skype owner Microsoft quietly updated its website to say that credits are no longer available. It's encouraging callers to instead buy monthly subscriptions, which vary in price and minutes depending on which countries you want to call, or to simply place Skype-to-Skype VoIP calls. When Foursquare launched at SXSW 2009, it promised an easy way to keep tabs on your friends' whereabouts and get recommendations for nearby restaurants, bars, and shops. But over the last decade, Foursquare's business has tilted increasingly toward providing location services to other businesses. Foursquare's City Guide app shut down this month, and its web version will expire early next year. Foursquare’s original check-in feature lives on in the company’s Swarm app. I started out covering tech policy in D.C. for The National Journal, where my beat included state-level tech news and all the congressional hearings and FCC meetings I could handle.

Investing.com -- Bank of America outlined its 2025 semiconductor outlook on Monday, spotlighting six chip stocks it recommends for investors in the coming year. The bank forecasts a 15% increase in semiconductor industry sales to $725 billion in 2025. This growth, although robust, is projected to be slower compared to the 20% growth seen in the current year. BofA anticipates memory sales to rise by 20% in 2025, following a 79% year-over-year increase in 2024, with core semiconductors, excluding memory, expected to grow by 13%. “We see 2025 as a year of two different trends. In the first half, AI investments and NVDA Blackwell deployments driven by US cloud customers sustain momentum in AI semis,” analysts led by Vivek Arya said in a note. “However, in the 2H (second half), interest could shift to less-crowded auto/industrial chipmakers on inventory replenishment and pick-up in auto production assuming a global economic recovery.” BofA’s top picks include leaders in AI such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL). “In AI we continue to trust.. at least till 2H25,” analysts said. Furthermore, the firm identified Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) as a flash-memory tool leader poised for capital expenditure recovery and impact resolution in China. Auto and electric vehicle (EV) leader ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is highlighted for its potential cyclical recovery in the second half of 2025, and Cadence Design Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CDNS) is noted for its resilient double-digit growth, especially as the AI hardware cycle decelerates in the latter half of the year. The report also includes rating changes for smaller mid-cap stocks. Advanced Energy Industries (NASDAQ:AEIS) has been upgraded to Buy from Neutral, and Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) has been raised to Neutral from Underperform due to expected growth acceleration. On the other hand, Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) has been downgraded to Underperform from Neutral, with analysts citing a “lack of catalysts.” Moreover, BofA recognizes the potential in small to mid-cap stocks such as Coherent (NYSE:COHR), MACOM Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:MTSI), and Ceragon Networks (NASDAQ:CRNT), especially as growth extends to networking and optics sectors beyond just computing. “Despite the crowded nature of AI stocks, we still see a continued “arms-race” between cloud service providers, TAM expansion into enterprise on-premises and sovereign deployments, and continued pace of innovation in training and inference (agentic AI),” analysts continued. “However, AI stocks could potentially peak in 2H25E when investors start to get concerned about tougher YoY compares in 2026E following two years of 100%+ annual growth in AI silicon.”

December 16, 2024 06:30 ET | Source: Radisson Mining Resources Inc. Radisson Mining Resources Inc. ROUYN-NORANDA, Quebec, Dec. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radisson Mining Resources Inc. (TSX-V: RDS, OTCQB: RMRDF) (“Radisson” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce results from an important diamond drill hole at its 100%-owned O’Brien Gold Project (“O’Brien” or the “Project”) located in the Abitibi region of Québec. OB-24-337 is an exploratory hole drilled to a depth of 1,700 metres, the deepest hole ever drilled at the Project and the first hole drilled directly below the historic O’Brien Mine workings. At approximately 1,500 metres vertical depth it intersected sheared and mineralized rocks of the Piché Group, the dominant host rocks for O’Brien gold mineralization, and returned 242.0 g/t gold (“Au”) over 1.0 metre within a mineralized interval that averaged 31.24 g/t Au over 8.0 metres. Matt Manson, President and CEO, commented: “Following our “Jewellery Box” re-discovery news of December 9, 2024, we are taking the unusual step of releasing assays from another single drill hole today because of its particular significance to the future of the O’Brien Gold Project. Hole OB-24-337 was intended to be a pilot hole testing whether the Project’s host geology extended below the historic mine and to be a platform for future wedging and directional drilling. The fact that this hole intersected mineralization and visible gold at such a high grade greatly exceeded our expectations. Recall that approximately 75% of our existing Mineral Resource is defined at depths above 600 metres. On September 24th we announced that drill hole OB-24-324 had intersected 27.61 g/t Au over 6.0 metres at 1,100 metres vertical depth. Now, we have new gold mineralization in a classic O’Brien setting at 1,500 metres vertical depth, a full 500 metres below the deepest workings of the old mine. It is clear that O’Brien gold mineralization is extensive at depth, implying significant future upside potential for the Project.” Figure 1: Visible Gold in Drill Hole OB-24-337 Figure 2: Long Section in Oblique View of Gold Vein Mineralization and Mineral Resources at the O’Brien Gold Project, with Drill Hole OB-337 and Other Recent Deep Drill Holes Illustrated. Table 1: Detailed Assay Results from Drill Hole OB-24-337 Notes on Calculation of Drill Intercepts:The O’Brien Gold Project March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) utilizes a 4.50 g/t Au bottom cutoff, a US$1600 gold price, a minimum mining width of 1.2 metres, and a 40 g/t Au upper cap on composites. Intercepts from drill hole OB-24-337 presented in Table 1 are calculated with a 1.00 g/t bottom cut-off over a minimum 1.0 metre core length so as to illustrate the frequency and continuity of mineralized intervals within which high-grade gold veins at O’Brien are developed. Intercepts presented in the deep drill hole compilation in Table 2 are calculated with a 3.00 g/t Au bottom cut-off, representing the lower limit of cut-off sensitivity presented in the March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate. Sample grades are uncapped. True widths, based on depth of intercept and drill hole inclination, are estimated to be 30-70% of core length.

Seven deep drill holes or drill hole wedges have been completed since this time. Six of the seven returned instances of visible gold and five of the seven returned drill intercepts well above the Project’s grade cutoff in the March 2023 MRE. The holes were drilled at northerly declinations with initial inclinations of between -65 and -85 degrees, followed by angling to provide a high angle of incidence with the southerly dip of the Piché Group rocks and vein mineralization. Estimated true widths of drill intercepts at the point of contact with mineralization is estimated to be 30-70% of core length. Deep drill results since September 2024, summarized in Table 2, have now included: and now: The frequency and grade of intercepts returned by these deep drill holes, as well as the observed host geology, its deformation, the style of alteration, and the mineralogical association of the gold mineralization, are all familiar from the historical O’Brien mine and consistent with the modern geological model developed at shallower depths. The implication is that characteristic O’Brien style gold mineralization is extensive at depth, well below the level of the historic mine workings and the current MRE. Gold Mineralization at O’Brien Gold mineralizing quartz-sulphide veins at O’Brien occur within a thin band of interlayered mafic volcanic rocks, conglomerates, and porphyric andesitic sills of the Piché Group occurring in contact with the east-west oriented Larder Lake-Cadillac Break (“LLCB”). Gold, along with pyrite and arsenopyrite, is typically associated with shearing and a pervasive biotite alteration, and developed within multiple Piché Group lithologies and, occasionally, the hanging-wall Pontiac and footwall Cadillac meta-sedimentary rocks. As mapped at the historic O’Brien mine, and now replicated in the modern drilling, individual veins are generally narrow, ranging from several centimetres up to several metres in thickness. Multiple veins occur sub-parallel to each other, as well as sub-parallel to the Piché lithologies and the LLCB. Individual veins have well-established lateral continuity, with near-vertical, high-grade shoots developed over significant lengths. The historic O’Brien mine produced over half a million ounces of gold from such veins and shoots at an average grade exceeding 15 g/t and over a vertical extent of at least 1,000 metres. Based on drilling complete to the end of 2022, the Project has estimated Indicated Mineral Resources of 0.50 million ounces (1.52 million tonnes at 10.26 g/t Au), with additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.45 million ounces (1.60 million tonnes at 8.66 g/t Au). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Current exploration is focussed on delineating well developed vein mineralization to the east of the historic mine, with additional high-grade shoots becoming evident in the exploration data over what has been described as a series of repeating trends (“Trend #s 0 to 5”). Table 3: Drill Hole Collar Information for Holes contained in this News Release QA/QC All drill cores in this campaign are NQ in size. Assays were completed on sawn half-cores, with the second half kept for future reference. The samples were analyzed using standard fire assay procedures with Atomic Absorption (AA) finish at ALS Laboratory Ltd, in Val-d’Or, Quebec. Samples yielding a grade higher than 10 g/t Au were analyzed a second time by fire assay with gravimetric finish at the same laboratory.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Purvi Agarwal (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose on Monday, as investors looked ahead to an anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cut later in the week as well as several key data releases for clues on monetary policy next year. The Fed's final rate decision of the year is due on Wednesday, with traders pricing in an over 99% chance of a 25 basis point rate reduction, as per CME's FedWatch. Most megacap and growth stocks traded higher, with Google-parent Alphabet up 3.8% and Amazon.com rising 1.3%, boosting communication services and consumer discretionary sectors about 1.5% each. Both the Nasdaq 100 and the Nasdaq Composite touched fresh record highs, while the small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 0.8%. "The Nasdaq 100 has hit a fresh record high, and small-caps are in demand, as the final year-end chase gets underway, this is the 'Santa rally' almost right on cue," said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG. Ahead of the Fed decision, investors awaited Tuesday's retail sales data and other key releases scheduled throughout the week. With a rate cut all but priced in, investors' primary focus will be on policymakers' outlook for next year as bets moderate on the pace of rate cuts amid strong economic growth and persistent inflation. "The S&P's year-to-date 26.86% gain far exceeds the average 10.05% annual gain since 1995 ... this jampacked week of important economic figures along with the FOMC meeting could be the game changer," said Mark Malek, CIO at Siebert Financial. Stocks have overall had a bumper run in 2024 as gains in artificial intelligence-related companies, the start of the Fed's rate cutting cycle and expected pro-business policies from Donald Trump's incoming administration have lifted equities. S&P Global's December flash PMI showed manufacturing activity stood at 48.3, while services activity was at 58.5, above estimates of 55.7. At 12:13 p.m. the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.04 points, or 0.01%, to 43,823.02, the S&P 500 gained 24.04 points, or 0.40%, to 6,075.13 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 181.44 points, or 0.91%, to 20,108.16. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury briefly eased from an over three-week high before creeping back above 4.4%. Honeywell International gained 3.3% after the industrial conglomerate said it was exploring a separation of its aerospace business. Tesla leapt 5.4% after Wedbush Securities raised its price target on the stock to a Wall Street high of $515. Crypotocurrency stocks rose as bitcoin jumped above $106,000 after Trump suggested he plans to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, and bitcoin buyer MicroStrategy was set to join the Nasdaq 100 index. MicroStrategy jumped 5%, while bitcoin miner MARA Holdings gained 8.8%. Super Micro Computer, among those set to be removed from the Nasdaq 100, dropped 6.9%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.13-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.34-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and 14 new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 85 new highs and 141 new lows.

LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 14: The Intel logo is seen outside a pop-up store on Oxford Street ... [+] on November 14, 2024 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) Intel stock has declined by over 55% this year and trades at just about $21 per share. While part of the sell-off has come due to Intel’s market share losses in the CPU space and the broader industry pivot toward AI-focused GPU chips for data centers, the bigger issue for Intel has been its foundry business. Intel has invested about $25 billion into the business in each of the last two years and results have been hard to come by. The foundry reported a $7 billion operating loss on $18.9 billion in revenue. That being said, a turnaround is well within sight, in our view. Intel’s next-gen 18A fabrication process technology is almost ready to roll out, and the company also appears to be a key beneficiary of regulatory support under the Trump administration given its strategic importance to U.S. technological independence. See why you should consider selling Nvidia and buying Intel stock. The Latest 18A Process Node Intel is betting big on its 18A process, which it considers its most advanced yet, to turn around its foundry business. The process produces chips with technologies including RibbonFET gate-all-around transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery, which are expected to boost performance and power efficiency. The chips using this process will be based on a 1.8-nanometer node size, putting Intel slightly ahead of TSMC’s N2 process which operates at a 2 nm node and is expected to arrive in the second half of 2025. While TSMC claims that its N2 process will outperform Intel’s 18A in some crucial areas, such as SRAM density (enabling it to store more data in a smaller physical area), Intel’s 18A’s backside power delivery gives it a competitive edge​ with reduced power loss and better thermal performance. Good news on the new chip’s progress, or bad news if delays occur, could increase volatility in the stock. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Intel announced in early August that it had reached critical milestones with chips made using the 18A process, noting that the chip had powered on, booted operating systems, and was operational within Intel. The company expects external customers to tape out (move from design to foundry for manufacturing) their first 18A designs in 2025, with large-scale production to begin thereafter. Intel has secured big contracts with this technology, including with the U.S. Department of Defense for the RAMP-C program, which seeks to bring leading-edge semiconductor technology domestically. Other high-profile customers include Amazon and Microsoft, which intend to design custom chips, including AI accelerators. Also see, Do Custom AI Chips Make Marvell Stock A Buy? Although there have been rumors suggesting that chipmaker Broadcom, which has been testing out Intel’s 18A process, was disappointed with the yields of the new process, this was refuted by Intel’s ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger. Intel says that its process shows defect density figures of 0.4 defects per square centimeter for now, which is only slightly worse than TSMC’s benchmarks of 0.33 defects on its legacy N7 and N5 nodes at comparable stages of development - roughly a year before entering high volume production. Given that the standard for this stage of development is typically below 0.5 defects per square centimeter, it means that Intel could be well within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be adequate for generating usable yields. Intel Foundry’s Rising Geopolitical RolePresident-elect Donald Trump’s emphasis on boosting U.S. manufacturing could work in Intel’s favor, given its sizable domestic fabrication footprint. There’s a possibility that Intel could see considerable regulatory support aimed at boosting domestic chip production. For example, the new administration could look at imposing tariffs that make it more expensive for foreign fabrication companies to produce and export chips to the U.S. A stronger emphasis on domestic production, either through tariffs or via other policies, could drive more business to Intel. Intel’s foundry division - which produces chips for third-party customers - could also see stronger demand, particularly as companies look to rely on U.S. suppliers to avoid potential duties. Semiconductors are also critical for national security - an area that Trump has consistently emphasized - and Intel’s domestic manufacturing footprint is likely to be crucial as it helps to secure U.S. technological independence. Intel could also see a higher number of contracts awarded to it from the government, being the only American semiconductor player that both designs and fabricates leading-edge logic chips in the U.S. Intel won a $3 billion government contract to expand chip production for the U.S. military a few months ago, and there’s a possibility that this could scale up further under Trump, who boosted military spending over his last term. Intel’s huge fab capacity and its newest process nodes could help domestic semiconductor designs better secure their supply chains as well. Take Nvidia for example. The GPU titan relies almost exclusively on Taiwan’s TSMC to produce its cutting-edge AI chips. TSMC is based in Taiwan, making production vulnerable to geopolitical tensions with China. Intel, with its U.S.-based manufacturing, would mitigate that risk to a large extent. The decrease in INTC stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 6% in 2021, -47% in 2022, and 95% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could INTC face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery? Foundry Assets Provide A Backstop To Intel’s Valuation The semiconductor foundry business is risky given that management must make massive capital investment decisions based on predictions about future technologies several years before the demand for those technologies materializes. While Intel has seen major missteps with its current investment cycle, there’s probably a pretty limited downside for the stock at the moment. Intel’s stock currently trades at less than 1x its book value - essentially the net value of its assets after subtracting liabilities. This means the market is pricing Intel at just the value of its tangible assets while completely discounting its technological know-how in chip manufacturing and design, its increasing importance to national security, and its future potential. This creates an opportunity for investors who see potential beyond the company’s sizable balance sheet. Intel stock also trades at just about 21x its estimated 2025 earnings, which are depressed by its heavy foundry spending and recent market share losses. Earnings are projected at about $1 per share next year, down from close to $2 in 2022 and about $5 in 2021. As demand picks up, we could see a reversal in both earnings as well as Intel’s valuation multiple. Intel’s new co-CEOs say that the company’s Intel’s foundry business is in the process of being shifted to be a subsidiary, indicating that it could operate independently from the chip-design segment. The executives also indicated that the possibility of separating the foundry business from the rest of the company was an option in the future. This could also help to eventually unlock some value. We value Intel stock at about $27 per share, 30% ahead of the current market price. See our analysis of Intel’s valuation : Expensive or Cheap?

Title: Many CEOs don’t want bodyguards even after Brian Thompson murder — here’s what they’re doing instead

As corporations and their boards scramble to protect the C-suite after the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson — scrubbing company Web sites of bios and photos — they’re facing one big issue. Many executives don’t want to deal with the massive lifestyle change that can come with having a bodyguard. “Unless they’re ex-Mossad they probably aren’t going to be that helpful,” one high-level executive who has eschewed security, told NYNext. “I don’t want to walk around with bodyguards.” This person explained he’s been around enough people who have guards to see how it can interfere with your life — the annoyance of someone invading personal moments and never feeling truly alone. If anything, he believes, “It makes you more conspicuous.” Indeed, said Yale School of Management’s Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, “Most CEOs don’t want security.” Sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they are more willing to increase safety measures by taking safety into their own hands. That ranges from applying for a concealed carry permit to buying a pepper spray “pistol” (the Byrna gun, which advertises itself as being the “less lethal weapon”) to, in one case, even donning a bullet proof vest. Another source, who admits he’s been worried about disgruntled shareholders targeting him, said that since Thompson’s shooting he tries to be more aware of his surroundings when walking around. But he would rather be able to protect himself than outsource his safety. “It’s too affected,” he explains. But for boards — who could be on the hook for shareholder lawsuits if they’re not adequately protecting executives — security is a priority. “It’s not the first agenda item … but it’s pretty high up,” Sonnenfeld said. “There is panic from corporate America. If something happens to a public company CEO, it will affect the stock price,” said Mac Segal, whose AHNA Group provides security for wealthy individuals and corporations. “There has been a 30% uptick in interest and requests [for security] over the last week.” Meta, which spent nearly $25 million last year on executive security — dramatically more than almost any other major corporation — is setting the tone for what board members feel obligated to do, another security expert explained. “Without a doubt, that number is already going up — that is on every large company’s mind now,” said Kevin Hartz, the former Eventbrite CEO who recently launched Sauron, a high-end at-home security monitoring company. While bodyguards are the most obvious sign of protection, security experts are quick to note there are other, less obtrusive ways to keep executives safe. “It’s not about guys in dark suits and glasses,” Segal said, nothing that in some fields, those “can often be a status symbol.” Instead, it is about “monitoring risk” — paying attention to threats on social media, possibly sending an advance team to scope out a location before an exec arrives, or protecting the entrance and exit to company events, the office and even the person’s home. “You can opt for a lower-profile approach,” he added, noting he always provides clients a range of options. “Security is like medicine: Security firms shouldn’t be prescribing something [like bodyguards] if they don’t know what’s right for the company.” One group who is pro-bodyguard? The so-called “cryptonaires” who fear being targeted because their digital wealth can be accessed with just a password and transferred online to an anonymous user. Tadas Kasputis, founder of crypto exchange ExMarkets, told CryptoNews he got bodyguards after being kidnapped in his hometown in Lithuania in 2015. “They came out of nowhere,” he recalled, “pushed me into a van and drove around town trying to get me to tell them my bitcoin wallet passwords.” This story is part of NYNext, a new editorial series that highlights New York City innovation across industries, as well as the personalities leading the way.

Title: New Investment Scam Leverages AI, Social Media Ads to Target Victims Worldwide

Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a new kind of investment scam that leverages a combination of social media malvertising, company-branded posts, and artificial intelligence (AI) powered video testimonials featuring famous personalities, ultimately leading to financial and data loss. "The main goal of the fraudsters is to lead victims to phishing websites and forms that harvest their personal information," ESET noted in its H2 2024 Threat Report shared with The Hacker News. The Slovak cybersecurity company is tracking the threat under the name Nomani, a play on the phrase "no money." It said the scam grew by over 335% between H1 and H2 2024, with more than 100 new URLs detected daily on average between May and November 2024. The attacks play out through fraudulent ads on social media platforms, in several cases targeting people who have previously been scammed by making use of Europol- and INTERPOL-related lures about contacting them for help or getting their stolen money refunded by clicking on a link. These ads are published from a mix of fake and stolen legitimate profiles associated with small businesses, governmental entities, and micro-influencers with tens of thousands of followers. Other distribution channels include sharing these posts on Messenger and Threads, as well as sharing deceptively positive reviews on Google. "Another large group of accounts frequently spreading Nomani ads are newly created profiles with easy-to-forget names, a handful of followers, and very few posts," ESET pointed out. The websites these links direct to have been found to request for their contact information and visually imitate local news media; abuse logos and branding of specific organizations; or claim to advertise cryptocurrency management solutions with ever-changing names such as Quantum Bumex, Immediate Mator, or Bitcoin Trader. In the next step, cybercriminals use the data gathered from the phishing domains to directly call the victims and manipulate them into investing their money into non-existent investment products that falsely show phenomenal gains. In some cases, victims are duped into taking out loans or installing remote access apps on their devices. "When these victim 'investors' request payout of the promised profits, the scammers force them to pay additional fees and to provide further personal information such as ID and credit card information," ESET said. "In the end, the fraudsters take both the money and data and disappear – following the typical pig butchering scam." There is evidence to suggest that Nomani is the work of Russian-speaking threat actors given the presence of source code comments in Cyrillic and the use of Yandex tools for visitor tracking. Similar to major scam operations like Telekopye, it's suspected that there are different groups who are in charge of managing each and every aspect of the attack chain: Theft, creation, and abuse of Meta accounts and ads, building the phishing infrastructure, and running the call centers. "By using social engineering techniques and building trust with the victims, scammers often outmaneuver even the authorization mechanisms and verification phone calls the banks use to prevent fraud," ESET said. The development comes as South Korean law enforcement authorities said they took down a large-scale fraud network that defrauded nearly $6.3 million from victims with fake online trading platforms as part of an operation called MIDAS. More than 20 servers utilized by the fraud ring have been seized and 32 people involved in the scheme have been arrested. Besides luring victims with SMS and phone calls, users of the illicit home trading system (HTS) programs were enticed into investing their funds by watching YouTube videos and joining KakaoTalk chat rooms. "The program communicates with the servers of real brokerage firms to get real-time stock price information, and uses publicly available chart libraries to create visual representations," the Financial Security Institute (K-FSI) said in a presentation given at the Black Hat Europe conference last week. "However, no actual stock trades are made. Rather, the program's core feature, a screen capture function, is used to spy on users' screens, collect unauthorized information, and refuse to return money."

Title: Webscale Network Operators Exhibit Robust Growth and Investment in Q3 2024

December 16, 2024 05:14 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Dec. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Webscale Network Operators: 3Q24 Market Review" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report reviews the growth and development of the webscale network operator (WNO, or webscale) market since 2011. It covers 21 companies. In the most recent 12 months (4Q23-3Q24), webscalers represented $2.53 trillion (T) in revenues (+9.1% YoY), $307 billion (B) in R&D spending (+6.5% YoY), and $254B in capex (+32.5% YoY). They had $631B of cash and short-term investments (-11.3% YoY) on the books as of September 2024, and $538B in total debt (-4.1% YoY). The value of webscalers' net plant, property & equipment (net PP&E) on the books as of September 2024 was $854B, up 25.9% YoY. Webscalers employed approximately 4.226 million (M) people at the end of 3Q24, up 2.3% from the Sept. 2023 total of 4.130M. Key Report Highlights: Revenues: Single quarter revenues in 3Q24 were $638.6 billion (B), up 10.6% YoY. That pushed annualized revenues to $2.527 trillion. Topline growth has been driven by the big 4: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (FB) and Microsoft. For five straight quarters, all of these companies have recorded double digit revenue growth, well above the rest of the pack. For the 3Q24 annualized period, the fastest growth came from Meta, up 23.1% versus 4Q22-3Q23, followed by Microsoft (+16.4%), Alphabet (14.4%), and Amazon (11.9%). The biggest dollar impact on growth in 3Q24 came from Amazon, as its single quarter revenues grew $15.8 billion from 3Q23 to end 3Q24 at $158.9B, up 11.0% YoY. The only curb on growth in 3Q24 was Japanese IT services & cloud vendor Fujitsu, which recorded 3Q24 revenues of $5.8B, down $492 million (M) YoY (-7.8%). Capex: After declining 5% in 2023, webscale capex has grown at incredibly fast, unsustainable rates in 2024: up by 25%, 51%, and 58% YoY in the first three quarters of the year. 3Q24 capex of $75.6B pushed the annualized total to $253.9B, up 32.5% YoY, and another all-time high. Investor interest in generative AI has spread rapidly, driving GPU spend in the data center. The current investment spike would seem to be inspired by a mix of hype and fear of missing out, as GenAI brings with it a plethora of legal & regulatory risks and relative lack of proven business models. Most recent webscale capex is focused on outfitting existing data centers: from 46% of annualized capex in 3Q22, Network/IT and software capex was 53% of total capex for the latest annualized period. The biggest capex outlays in 3Q24 came from Amazon ($22.6B), Microsoft ($14.9B), Alphabet ($13.1B), and Meta (FB) ($8.3B). These four account for about 80% of single quarter spending. They are the reason behind the unsustainable surge in the price of NVIDIA stock. Profitability: Webscale free cash flow margins averaged out to 17.6% for the 3Q24 annualized period, a bit lower than a year prior (17.9%) but higher than the 14.1% booked in 3Q22. Average net profit margin for 4Q23-3Q24 was 18.9%, a bit higher than 16.9% in 3Q23. Both profitability metrics are around the same level as in the year before COVID. Meta, Tencent and Microsoft are regularly near or at the top of the heap on both metrics, and this was again the case in 3Q24. The ecommerce specialists Amazon and Alibaba are the laggards, as usual. The biggest drops in free cash flow margins came at the companies with surging capex: Alphabet and Amazon. The biggest decline in net profitability was Apple, which was fined 13 billion Euros in September 2024 for taking illegal profits from a tax scheme in Ireland over two decades. This tax scheme has been widely known about and criticized for many years. While 13 billion sounds like a lot, it hardly impacted Apple's market trajectory at all. Apple's stock price is around 14% higher now than on 1 July 2024. Consumers and taxpayers are losing out, while big tech uses political friends to secure victories. This will get worse with new political leadership in the US. Employees: Headcount in the webscale market totaled to 4.23 million in September 2024, slightly up from 4.13 million in September 2023. This difference is negligible, considering the size of some of the webscalers and how quickly the ecommerce specialists in particular can change workforce levels. Amazon's workforce grew by 51,000 between September 2023 and 2024, for instance. Total webscale headcount has been approximately 4.1 to 4.2 million or so steadily since late 2021. Some of the biggest webscalers are investing heavily in AI and GenAI, with one clear goal being to improve their internal cost efficiencies. This inevitably will mean fewer employees. Even within the ecommerce space, there is a rising use of robots and autonomous vehicles in the logistics chain. Per our latest forecast, we expect webscale employment to rise slightly in 2025 but decline thereafter due to greater use of robotics, automation and AI. Regional trends: The Asia-Pacific region has been a drag on the market for several quarters, and that continued in 3Q24. Webscale revenues in the Americas, Europe, and MEA have been growing in the low double digit range for a few quarters, but AP has been weak: 3Q24 revenue growth was 5% YoY, in line with the last few quarters of low single digit percentage growth. Weak Asian currencies and a very competitive 'big tech' market in China account for the gap. Another factor is TikTok. This company, owned by ByteDance, has grown at explosive rates for the last few years, but remains private. We have no reasonable way to include TikTok figures in our database. The ByteDance surge also ate into the 2022-23 growth of some western webscalers, notably Meta (FB), but that effect has ebbed.

Title: What's ahead for the markets in 2025, according to experts

U.S. stocks rose in 2024, fueled by the unprecedented surge of artificial intelligence — a revolutionary technology that has driven investor sentiment. Inflation also eased after a couple of years of persistent price pressure, allowing the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates. The results of the presidential election provided an additional boost, propelling the Dow and other major stock indexes to record highs and setting the stage for 2025. As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, certain sectors and stocks are expected to see significant shifts. Here’s what analysts and experts expect. The S&P 500 was hovering above 6,000 in mid-December. Major banks including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have forecast that the benchmark index will reach 6,500 in 2025. The optimism is supported by confidence in ongoing earnings growth and a favorable monetary policy environment, key drivers of market performance. Eric Schiffer, chairman of the Los Angeles-based investment firm The Patriarch Organization, told Quartz in an email that he expects the S&P to reach 6,750 by the end of next year, with the Dow at 49,500 and Nasdaq at 22,100. (The Dow was at about 44,000 in mid-December, and the Nasdaq at about 20,000.) Jeff Krumpelman of Mariner Wealth Advisors has a similar forecast, expecting the S&P 500 to reach 6,600 by the end of 2025. In a more optimistic scenario, he anticipates the index could climb as high as 7,000. Paula Murphy, a senior vice president and director of portfolio management at the bank Rockland Trust, said financial firms stand to gain the most from the reduced regulation, corporate tax cuts, and lower capital requirements expected under Trump. That could drive an acceleration of loan growth and an increase in mergers and acquisitions activity for banks. Murphy said energy companies may also see new gains under the new administration. “Energy companies may also benefit from potential deregulation, as well as policy shifts to further boost domestic oil and natural gas production,” Murphy said in an email. She noted that potential sanctions on oil-exporting countries could tighten global supply, leading to higher prices. As China continues to be the world’s leading exporter of goods and the United States its largest importer — bringing in approximately $427 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2023 — these dynamics may have significant implications, Murphy said. “Inflationary pressures stemming from tougher trade with China may lead to volatility in sectors dependent on global supply chains,” she said. And restrictive immigration policies under Trump may reduce U.S. labor supply, Murphy said, resulting in higher wages. Those increased labor costs could shrink profit margins, especially in labor-intensive sectors such as agriculture, hospitality, and manufacturing. AI stocks have been some of the strongest in the market this year, with companies including AI chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) driving indexes to new heights. Next year is expected to usher in another phase of AI development, which could lead to greater efficiency and cost savings for businesses. Murphy said there will also be “increased awareness and scrutiny of the importance of developing and deploying AI in a way that is ethical, secure, transparent, reliable, and respectful of intellectual property rights.” Trump’s election win drove down renewable energy stocks, largely due to his hostile stance on climate policy. Murphy acknowledged that Trump’s victory could transform U.S. energy policy by prioritizing fossil fuels and opposing climate initiatives. But she said this doesn’t mean the renewable energy sector will stop growing. “Data center and AI rollout has increased demand for renewables by a significant amount this year, and we expect this to continue,” she said. “These data centers require massive power expenditures, and the companies building out these data centers frequently have self-imposed clean energy mandates.” It also remains to be seen how Trump’s close relationship with billionaire Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk will influence U.S. policy toward electric vehicles.

Title: What's ahead for tech in 2025, according to an IBM executive

Since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT two years ago, the tech industry has been consumed by generative artificial intelligence — and the next year will see more businesses adopt the technology, one tech executive predicts. Enterprises are already looking for technology to scale and implement AI, and the focus in 2025 will be on more efficiency and less risk, Hillery Hunter, chief technology officer and general manager of innovation at IBM (IBM) Infrastructure, told Quartz. With cost efficiency in mind, enterprises will likely look for smaller, more targeted generative AI models, Hunter said. Businesses could also turn to ensembles — or combining multiple machine learning or deep learning models for more accurate and robust results — that will allow them “to optimize latency, efficiency and accuracy across their AI workloads,” Hunter said. “For example,” Hunter said, “enterprises would have the option to use smaller, faster and more energy-efficient models on a CPU [core processing unit] as a starting point for data analysis and processing and then use larger models on a GPU [graphics processing unit], as needed, for more complex workloads that require extra performance, all within the same AI Workflow.” In July, Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang said the next wave of AI is for businesses, and that everyone at a company “will have an AI assistant.” “We hope that we can give every single organization the ability to create their own AIs,” Huang said during a fireside chat at SIGGRAPH, a computer graphics conference. “So everybody would be augmented and have a collaborative AI that could empower them, help them do better work.” As the tech industry focuses on launching new AI products, it’s now AI agents, or software that can complete complex tasks autonomously, that have taken over the chatbot hype. Most AI-powered tools that have launched so far are co-pilots that can help users work more efficiently, but have to be prompted over and over. In the next year, companies will risk being left behind if they don’t step up their AI efforts, Hunter said. While businesses saw AI become more important this year, they “often struggled with disjointed AI process steps and driving true ROI [return on investment].” Businesses have to bring AI projects together in 2025, Hunter said, or otherwise create “an increasingly bloated tech environment” with more costs and slower innovation. “It’s time for enterprises to kill the Frankencloud — a disjointed environment where data is duplicated and sprawled out across various, disconnected locations — and create the holistic view they need to actually leverage and govern the data and models associated with AI, and generate outcomes that support their AI investment,” Hunter said. Next year will also see enterprises commit to getting out of “tech debt” — debt from failing to modernize IT infrastructure or not having unified IT or cloud-based solutions that are needed to optimize AI. “AI itself will help modernize IT, but in the year ahead, collaboration across the C-suite is going to be key to getting out of this debt,” Hunter said.

Greetings, well, it’s well-known that when K.M. takes charge of something, he doesn’t make mistakes or do sloppy work. That’s what happened yesterday during the budget discussion, where the measures he announced for the banks outshone any proposals from the opposition. But he also gave a social touch by imposing a “mandatory donation” of 100 million euros from the banks to support school infrastructure. So, Kyriakos Mitsotakis took things a step further and caught the bankers off guard with yesterday’s announcements. On fees for basic transactions (bill payments, dealings with the public sector, etc.), we’re looking at a complete elimination—not mere reductions, as initially expected. This is estimated to cost banks about 120 million euros annually, alongside the ENFIA (property tax) adjustment, as the Prime Minister mentioned legislative provisions to make this permanent. Add 100 million euros for the body that will manage properties of vulnerable borrowers and another 100 million for funding the renovation and construction of new schools, and the ENFIA adjustment. Altogether, the bill handed to the banks yesterday amounts to approximately 320 million euros. K.M.’s announcements, such as covering pharmaceutical expenses for low-income pensioners and granting a hazard allowance for uniformed personnel, were initially proposals from New Democracy MPs. Back then, they were labeled as “rebellious” initiatives, but the Maximos Mansion didn’t “criminalize” the suggestions. Instead, it processed them and is now implementing them. This way, the government showcases tangible actions, and the MPs can boast to their constituents that they influenced governmental decisions. The other day, there was a technical failure on a Thessaloniki Metro train. Passengers were inconvenienced, having to walk along the tunnel’s emergency corridor, which is specifically designed for such situations. The whole power outage lasted about 90 minutes, but the actual inconvenience for passengers was much shorter. Nobody truly claimed there was any risk to people because the power cut affected a Metro train. Yet, in Parliament, PASOK, SYRIZA, and the New Left (especially Haritsis, who pretends to be “modern”) raised a huge fuss. Honestly, I don’t think there’s another country in Europe where the opposition collectively blows up over a power cut in a single train on a completely new Metro system (and therefore bound to have some technical glitches). We’re talking about sheer ridiculousness! Six months ago, on a Sunday afternoon in early summer, the public was bombarded with reports about the arrest of a well-known TV lawyer who had almost beaten his wife and mother of his children to death. Initially, there were absurd excuses he gave during the investigation—claims that she “fell down the stairs”—but soon, under pressure from the police and investigators, she revealed the horrific truth. There was explosive media coverage for a few days. The coroner’s report revealed brutal beatings (17 punches to a woman’s face!). There were also dubious claims of psychiatric issues, and eventually, the whole thing faded out of the spotlight. Fast forward six months—before the year even ends—and this monster of a lawyer is appearing on TV shows as an angel. Look, here’s his new home, his new partner, and praise for his severely beaten ex-wife as a good mother, and so on. And life goes on. Now, you tell me: with a government that boasts laws against domestic violence and a justice system like ours, can anyone believe that things are improving in this country? Rot and corruption, or just the overwhelming sense that, in the end, everything here gets swept under the rug and left “half-resolved”? We still don’t have any progress on the issue of abolishing the Public Sector’s special rights in its 8.4% stake in the National Bank of Greece. The delay didn’t come from the Finance Ministry or the HFSF (Hellenic Financial Stability Fund). From the Greek side, all procedures are complete, and the delay stems from discussions between the ESM and SSM. The SSM doesn’t oppose abolishing the special rights, but the ESM wants to handle the matter in a way that fully safeguards their interests. So, it’s just a matter of time. Financial constraints—let’s put it politely—are plaguing the billionaire (?) Beny Steinmetz, also known as the “diamond king.” Word in the market is that he sold one of his two mines in Guinea (the operational one), as well as the nickel plant he owned in Skopje. Regarding the refinery in Italy, which even got the attention of the Financial Times, it was eventually bought by shipping magnate G. Economou because Steinmetz couldn’t come up with 140 million euros at the time. I’m telling you this to keep you informed since Greece doesn’t have many billionaires, and Steinmetz is one of them. Aside from being the diamond king, he’s also the king of arrests at airports (Israel, Cyprus, etc.), thanks to warrants against him. So, he’s spending his time in our country—not that he’s suffering, as he splits his days between a residence in Vouliagmeni (owned by a well-known Greek businessman) and his yacht. The regional airports packaged together Ultimately, the 22 regional airports will be granted as a single “package” to one operator. These airports will be released from the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) for concession via an international tender in the first half of 2025. Advisors for the tender have already conducted on-site inspections of the airport cluster (Karpathos, Chios, Alexandroupolis, Araxos, Limnos, Ioannina, Milos, Naxos, Paros, Ikaria, Kythira, Leros, Sitia, Nea Anchialos, Kalymnos, Skyros, Syros, Astypalaia, Kastellorizo, Kastoria, Kasos, and Kozani) to assess their current condition and identify needs to structure the tender framework. There is also consideration for some of these airports to be utilized for cargo transport or charter flights. Additionally, there is an intention for HCAP to retain a stake in the airports, similar to the Kalamata airport case. However, some issues remain unresolved, such as matters involving the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), though HCAP estimates that the concession process will be completed by the end of 2027. The €765 million PPP for the prisons In April, bids are expected to be invited from interested companies for the major €765 million Public-Private Partnership (PPP) project involving the relocation of Korydallos prison to Aspropyrgos. A prerequisite is the approval of the environmental terms. A positive development is the recent approval of a special urban planning framework. The project, managed by the Recovery Fund’s Maturity Unit on behalf of the Ministry of Citizen Protection, involves partnering with a private entity for the design, construction, and maintenance of the facility for up to 30 years. Interest has been expressed by companies such as GEK Terna, Mytilineos, Aktor Concessions, and Avax, with the competitive dialogue nearing completion. The prisons will be relocated to a 100-acre property at the site of the former “American Convenience” military base in Aspropyrgos. The new premises and infrastructure for the modern Judicial Correctional Institution of Athens (JCIA) and the Attica Court Transfer Directorate (ACTD) will be located on the site of the old NATO base. End of an era Last year, Allianz stated that Christos Georgakopoulos, the founder of European Reliance, would remain a member of the board and an administrative advisor. However, his departure from the board of European Reliance-Allianz has quietly marked the end of his tenure. Tensions had arisen anyway, stemming from cultural differences between the German insurance giant and the Greek company. ADMIE board’s term extended Before the stock market opens today, ADMIE (the Independent Power Transmission Operator) will close the cycle of announcements for its nine-month results. Although the third-quarter financials are being released in mid-December, significantly late, they maintain expectations for a distribution of the remaining €14.5 million in dividends in September, along with the pre-dividend of €13.5 million. However, the key highlight is that by this time next year, the electrical connection between Attica and Crete will have been completed, generating an additional €770 million in annual revenue for ADMIE. Following the publication of the nine-month financial statements, a letter will be sent to shareholders regarding the renewal of the current administration’s term, resolving the final pending matter of the year. ECB halts bond purchases starting today Starting today, the European Central Bank (ECB) will permanently cease repurchasing bonds issued under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP). This marks the ECB’s withdrawal from the European bond market as the largest buyer of eurozone countries’ debt. The ECB launched PEPP in March 2020 following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching a peak portfolio of €1.72 trillion two years later. Bond reinvestments were scaled back in July and officially end today, as the ECB wraps up for the holiday season. From now on, each issuer of debt—i.e., each individual country—will have to manage market fears and expectations, which will dictate the pricing of their bonds. The biggest challenge will likely be faced by France, where 52% of its public debt is managed by foreign investors and funds. France’s public debt already stands at 118% of GDP, and Paris will be seeking more than €300 billion (!) in 2025. Greece, on the other hand, appears to have managed its situation, with the €8 billion it needs to borrow next year not expected to pose a problem. The Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA) has planned only two new short-term bond issues and 10 re-issues on agreed dates. Industrial parks The prepayment (40% of the subsidy) from the Recovery Fund has been disbursed to ETBA Industrial Parks S.A. for the business plan aimed at developing industrial parks. elvoX automotive | mobility | technology is a Greek startup that designs and develops electric commercial vehicles—vans. Based in Acharnes, the elvoX team is striving to bring electric innovation to the commercial vehicle market. Reports suggest that this Greek startup has already attracted the interest of angel investors, mainly from the Middle East, for the development of its pioneering electric vehicles designed to meet the needs of urban and suburban professional transport, with the potential for future autonomous operation. Foreign investors are using Greece as a pilot “entry point” for research and development, prototype completion, and—if all goes well—the initiation of electric van production in Greece for the European market. Last Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 86 points (-0.2%), marking its 7th consecutive session of losses. This is the longest losing streak for the blue-chip index in nearly five years. This is happening during a period of general stock market euphoria on the other side of the Atlantic, where 46% of investors predict further price increases. However, at the same time, there have been record stock sales by major shareholders of Wall Street’s “champions.” For example, Jeff Bezos of Amazon sold $1.25 billion worth of his company’s shares in November. In total, in 2024, Amazon’s founder and his close associates sold $12.5 billion worth of shares. Last week, Mark Zuckerberg liquidated another block of Meta shares worth $153 million. In 2024 alone, Zuckerberg sold shares of the company he founded worth approximately $2.4 billion. Meta is now valued at over $1.5 trillion for the first time in history, and the S&P 500 index appears poised to end the year with annual gains of around 24% or more. Meanwhile, top executives at NVIDIA have also announced stock sales worth $1.85 billion this year. A total of about 11 million NVIDIA shares have been sold since the start of the year, the most of any single company. Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO, revealed he sold 6 million shares. The question remains: who knows better? Those selling shares of the companies they lead, or those buying them? The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the FED will conclude its two-day meeting this coming Wednesday. Markets have already priced in a quarter-point reduction in the federal funds rate. Things will get more interesting next year, with less consensus on how the FED should address persistent inflation amidst concerns about economic growth. But that’s a problem for next year. For now, investors have the holiday season to look forward to. The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan will announce their monetary policy decisions on Thursday. However, Jerome Powell’s problem is much more complex. Currently, the average interest rate on U.S. government debt is 3.4%, the highest since 2008. The U.S. government is paying heavily for its borrowing. Over the last two years, U.S. debt interest rates have more than doubled. About $6.4 trillion of U.S. debt is in treasury bills with an average interest rate of 4.7%, while $14.4 trillion is in government bonds with an average interest rate of 2.8%. In reality, the total net interest cost reached an annualized record pace of $1.1 trillion in the third quarter of 2024. The U.S. government is spending $3 billion EVERY DAY just on interest payments. This may very well be the only reason Powell feels compelled to reduce dollar interest rates… Explore related questions

Title: MicroStrategy stock surges on Nasdaq-100 inclusion announcement

Investing.com -- MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) shares popped 6% in premarket trading Monday as investors welcomed the Friday announcement from the Nasdaq exchange operator that the stock will be added to the Nasdaq-100 index. The move follows a dramatic rise in the shares of the Bitcoin-focused company. The inclusion will take effect before the market opens on December 23. Being added to the index often boosts a stock price, as funds that track the Nasdaq-100 typically buy shares of the newly included firms to align with the index's composition. In addition to MicroStrategy, Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR), a data analytics firm, and Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), known for its Taser products, will also be added to the index. Meanwhile, Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), a maker of gene-sequencing equipment, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), which specializes in AI servers, and vaccine maker Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) are set to be removed. MicroStrategy, which has aggressively invested in Bitcoin, has seen its stock skyrocket more than sixfold this year, boosting its market capitalization to nearly $94 billion. The company shifted its strategy in 2020, using Bitcoin as a reserve asset amid declining revenue from its software business. Today, it holds the title of the largest corporate owner of the cryptocurrency. Analysts suggest that MicroStrategy’s pivot to Bitcoin has made its stock more attractive, as its performance closely mirrors the cryptocurrency's fluctuations. Bernstein analysts predict that the Nasdaq-100 inclusion could pave the way for potential S&P 500 inclusion by 2025. They also see the company's prospects continuing to improve next year, adding they anticipate "more visibility and recognition beyond fresh ETF inflows," as a result of the Nasdaq-100 inclusion. Bitcoin has surged in recent weeks, fueled by optimism within the crypto sector following US President-elect Donald Trump's victory, which has raised expectations of reduced regulatory hurdles. Earlier this month, the cryptocurrency crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time.

By Medha Singh (Reuters) -MicroStrategy shares briefly surged on Monday before faltering to end nearly unchanged, after the software company and bitcoin stockpiler was selected to join the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index, further brightening the prospects of the stock. The $25.7 trillion index that houses the largest non-financial companies will now gain indirect exposure to bitcoin via MicroStrategy, which holds $44 billion worth of the digital currency on its balance sheet, about 2% of the total supply of the world's largest cryptocurrency. The prospect of more buying from funds that track the Nasdaq 100 could further boost MicroStrategy's stock that has surged nearly 550% this year alongside a jump in the bitcoin price. Its share price rose as much as 7% on Monday before running out of steam to close 0.042% lower It could be "the start of a looping cycle of capital that could potentially drive up the spot BTC price," said Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency asset manager Astronaut Capital. "ETFs such as QQQ and many others would buy MicroStrategy to mirror holdings of the index, therefore driving up the price, and in turn, allowing MicroStrategy to purchase more BTC through debt, bond and equity offerings." The fifth largest U.S. exchange-traded fund Invesco QQQ Trust tracks the Nasdaq 100 and has $328 billion in assets under management, according to data analytics company VettaFi. Bitcoin surged to a record high above $107,000 on Monday after President-elect Donald Trump suggested he plans to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its strategic oil reserve. MicroStrategy's shares have gained 3,200% since adopting bitcoin as its treasury asset in 2020 under the leadership of co-founder Michael Saylor. The company has more than doubled its bitcoin holdings this year through convertible note offerings and share sales. It reported a net loss of $340 million in the three months ended Sept. 20, its third consecutive quarterly loss. "MicroStrategy's bitcoin strategy is a long-term, high-conviction 'buy and hold' strategy," said Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. The company's market capitalization rose to over $100 billion as its share price climbed, more than twice the value of its bitcoin stockpile. At the close it was valued at almost $98 billion. Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) and some small biotech firms including Enlivex Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ENLV) and Hoth Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HOTH) have also decided to allocate portions of their cash to bitcoin. "Longer term, this is a huge milestone for crypto and we are bound to hear the voices, both bulls and bears, get a lot louder talking about MicroStrategy and Saylor in the months to come," Dibb said. Short sellers, or investors betting against MicroStrategy's shares, have lost a total of $9.7 billion since the beginning of the year. Other entrants to the Nasdaq 100 include Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) and Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), Nasdaq said late on Friday, replacing Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), Super Micro and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA). The reconstituted index will begin trading on Dec. 23.

Photo Credit: Reuters MicroStrategy started buying and holding BTC in 2020 as revenue from its software business waned MicroStrategy will be added to the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 Index, the exchange operator said on Friday, following a meteoric surge in the shares of the bitcoin buyer. The change comes into effect before the market opens on Dec. 23, Nasdaq said. Inclusion in the index typically boosts the stock's price, as exchange-traded funds looking to replicate the index's performance buy shares of the newly included firm. Data analytics firm Palantir Technologies and Taser maker Axon Enterprise were added to the Nasdaq-100 Index along with MicroStrategy. Gene-sequencing equipment maker Illumina, AI server maker Super Micro Computer and vaccine maker Moderna were removed, Nasdaq said. MicroStrategy, an aggressive investor in the world's largest crypto asset, has seen its shares soar more than six-fold this year, taking its market value to almost $94 billion (roughly Rs. 7,97,387 crore). The company began buying and holding bitcoin in 2020 as revenue from its software business waned. It is now the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Analysts have said MicroStrategy's decision to purchase bitcoin to protect the value of its reserve assets has enhanced the appeal of its stock, which tends to align with the performance of the cryptocurrency. Bernstein analysts expect the market will likely set its sights on S&P 500 inclusion for MicroStrategy in 2025 following the Nasdaq-100 inclusion. The brokerage also sees the company's prospects continuing to improve next year, adding it expects "more visibility and recognition beyond fresh ETF inflows," as a result of the Nasdaq-100 inclusion. Bitcoin has rallied in recent weeks as US President-elect Donald Trump's victory heightened the crypto sector's hopes for easing regulatory roadblocks. Earlier this month, the digital asset catapulted above $100,000 (roughly Rs.84.8 lakh) for the first time. "Management has shown no signs of slowing this (bitcoin-buying) down and are comfortable buying bitcoin in the $95,000 (roughly Rs. 80.5 lakh) - $100,000 (roughly Rs. 84.8 lakh) range," Bernstein analysts said. The company held roughly 423,650 bitcoins bought for about $25.6 billion (roughly Rs. 2,17,148 crore) based on the average purchase price as of December 8. The investment is worth around $42.43 billion (roughly Rs. 3,59,905 crore), based on bitcoin's previous close, according to Reuters calculations. © Thomson Reuters 2024 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

We've rounded up deals on Batman Lego sets, Blu-ray box sets, and the Meta Quest 3S Batman: Arkham Shadow bundle below the omnibus. $82 ($150) After Batman: Arkham Asylum became a huge hit in 2009, DC Comics didn't waste any time creating extra content for fans to dig into.

The full list for this collection includes: These are all great miniseries and one-shots featuring several of DC's best creators at the helm, and Batman: Arkham Unhinged is notable for being a digital-first series that has been added to this collection. While it was later reprinted in traditional comic book form, it is nice to have it included with the other series in this omnibus. Another cool thing about this hardcover is that the Arkham City series was illustrated by Carlos D'Anda, who worked with Rocksteady to create several unique redesigns for Batman and his rogues gallery in the Arkham games.

U.S. stock indexes drifted through mixed trading ahead of a meeting by the Federal Reserve later this week that could set Wall Street’s direction into next year NEW YORK -- U.S. stock indexes drifted amid mixed trading Monday, ahead of this week’s upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve that could set Wall Street’s direction into next year. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, coming off its first losing week in the last four. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.2% to a record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a laggard and fell 110 points, or 0.3%. Broadcom leaped 11.2% to help lead the S&P 500 for a second straight day after delivering a profit report last week that beat analysts’ expectations. The technology company is riding a wave of enthusiasm about its artificial-intelligence offerings in particular. The market’s main event, though, will arrive on Wednesday when the Federal Reserve will announce its last move on interest rates for the year. The widespread expectation is that it will cut its main rate for a third straight time, as it tries to boost the slowing job market after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its target of 2%. The question is how much more it will cut rates next year, and Fed officials will release projections for where they see the federal funds rate ending 2025, along with other economic indicators, once their meeting concludes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also answer questions in a press conference following the meeting. For now, the general expectation among traders is that the Fed may cut a couple more times in 2025, according to data from CME Group. But such expectations have been shrinking following reports suggesting inflation may be tougher to get all the way down to 2% from here. Besides last month’s slight acceleration in inflation, another worry is that President-elect Donald Trump’s preferences for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation down the line. Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle has dropped his earlier forecast of a cut by the Fed in January, for example. Beyond the possibility of tariffs, he said Fed officials may also want to slow their cuts because of uncertainty about exactly how low rates need to go so that they no longer press the brakes on the economy. Expectations for a series of cuts to rates by the Fed have been one of the main reasons the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 57 times so far this year and is heading for one of its best years of the millennium.

Title: Stock market today: Asian shares fall as China reports lackluster data, while bitcoin hits new highs

U.S. stock indexes drifted through mixed trading ahead of a meeting by the Federal Reserve later this week that could set Wall Street’s direction into next year NEW YORK -- U.S. stock indexes drifted amid mixed trading Monday, ahead of this week’s upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve that could set Wall Street’s direction into next year. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, coming off its first losing week in the last four. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.2% to a record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a laggard and fell 110 points, or 0.3%. Broadcom leaped 11.2% to help lead the S&P 500 for a second straight day after delivering a profit report last week that beat analysts’ expectations. The technology company is riding a wave of enthusiasm about its artificial-intelligence offerings in particular. The market’s main event, though, will arrive on Wednesday when the Federal Reserve will announce its last move on interest rates for the year. The widespread expectation is that it will cut its main rate for a third straight time, as it tries to boost the slowing job market after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its target of 2%. The question is how much more it will cut rates next year, and Fed officials will release projections for where they see the federal funds rate ending 2025, along with other economic indicators, once their meeting concludes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also answer questions in a press conference following the meeting. For now, the general expectation among traders is that the Fed may cut a couple more times in 2025, according to data from CME Group. But such expectations have been shrinking following reports suggesting inflation may be tougher to get all the way down to 2% from here. Besides last month’s slight acceleration in inflation, another worry is that President-elect Donald Trump’s preferences for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation down the line. Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle has dropped his earlier forecast of a cut by the Fed in January, for example. Beyond the possibility of tariffs, he said Fed officials may also want to slow their cuts because of uncertainty about exactly how low rates need to go so that they no longer press the brakes on the economy. Expectations for a series of cuts to rates by the Fed have been one of the main reasons the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 57 times so far this year and is heading for one of its best years of the millennium. The economy has held up better than many feared, continuing to grow even after the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to a two-decade high in hopes of grinding down on inflation, which topped 9% two summers ago. On Wall Street, MicroStrategy jumped as much as 7% during the day as it continues to benefit from the surging price for bitcoin, which set another all-time high.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The buzz around generative artificial intelligence (AI) and expectations of falling interest rates are driving several technology stocks higher. While there are concerns about stretched valuations, Wall Street analysts continue to see further upside in many tech names. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, we placed Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Alibaba (BABA) against each other to find the tech stock that could offer the highest upside potential from current levels, according to analysts. Discover top-rated stocks from highly ranked analysts with Analyst Top Stocks! Easily identify outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Apple shares have risen about 29% so far this year. The iPhone maker impressed investors with better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024. The company’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 12% to $1.64, with sales rising 6% to $94.9 billion. Notably, revenue from iPhone, which accounted for about 49% of the overall sales, grew 5.5% to $46.2 billion. Moreover, revenue from Services, which is a higher-margin business compared to Apple’s products, grew 12% to about $25 billion. Apple expects its Services revenue growth in the December quarter to be nearly the same as its growth rate in the past year (12.9%). Further, the company expects its December overall sales to rise by “low to mid-single digit.” While there are concerns about the impact of competition on iPhone sales in key markets like China, several analysts remain confident about the company due to its growing Services business and AI initiatives like Apple Intelligence. Baird analyst William Power raised the price target for Apple stock to $260 from $240 while reiterating a Buy rating. Power noted that AAPL currently trades at 32.8x of the calendar year 2025 EPS estimate, reflecting about a 50% premium to the S&P 500’s (SPX) multiple of 22x. He added that his $260 target price is based on a 34x P/E multiple (calculated on 2025 EPS forecast), placing it towards the high end of the stock’s 10-35x historical range and a premium to other tech and consumer leaders. Power explained that the premium valuation reflects solid execution, growing contribution from Services, continued eco-system benefits, and impressive free cash flow. With 20 Buys, nine Holds, and two Sells, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on Apple stock. The average AAPL stock price target of $243.20 implies 2% downside risk. See more AAPL analyst ratings Semiconductor giant Nvidia’s shares have rallied more than 171% year-to-date, driven by the robust demand for its advanced GPUs (graphics processing units) that are required for powering generative AI models and applications. Last month, Nvidia reported market-beating results for the third quarter of Fiscal 2025. Revenue grew 94% year-over-year to $35.1 billion, while adjusted EPS jumped 103% to $0.81. Despite strong Q3 results, there have been some concerns about the slowdown in revenue growth. Additionally, investors are worried about the longevity of the AI-induced demand. Nonetheless, Nvidia is optimistic about its future prospects, supported by robust demand for its Hopper and Blackwell platforms amid the generative AI boom. Following the Q3 print, Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso raised the price target on NVIDIA stock to $180 from $150 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst said that the new price target is based on a P/E (price-to-earnings) multiple of about 42x his 2025 (calendar year) EPS estimate of $4.26, which is slightly above the stock’s nearly 37x average multiple over the past five years. Caso further contended that the P/E multiple of 42x is reasonable given his expectation for almost 50% revenue growth next year. The analyst said that NVDA had been his favorite stock for several years, and continues to be so, given that it is the chief beneficiary of the AI wave. Caso thinks there is a clear path to over $200 billion in data center revenue based on supply chain forecasts related to the Blackwell ramp, which could drive an EPS of $5 in Fiscal 2026. Coming to the consensus rating, Nvidia scores a Strong Buy based on 37 buys and three Hold recommendations. At $176.14, the average NVDA stock price target implies 31.2% upside potential. See more NVDA analyst ratings Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba recently announced upbeat earnings for the September quarter. Net income jumped 58% to RMB 43.9 billion, driven by the rise in operating income and mark-to-market changes in equity investments. Meanwhile, revenue grew 5% to RMB 236.5 billion even as macro pressures continue to impact consumer spending. In a statement on the September quarter results, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu stated that the company is more confident about its core businesses and continues to invest in its long-term growth. BABA shares have advanced more than 15% so far this year, partially due to the optimism about the stimulus measures being assured by the Chinese government to boost the economy. Despite macro uncertainty and the US-China tensions, several analysts are bullish on BABA due to its restructuring efforts, the company’s cloud business, and AI-related growth opportunities. It is worth noting that the growth in Alibaba’s Cloud business accelerated in the September quarter compared to the prior quarters, with revenue from public cloud products increasing by double digits and AI-related product revenue witnessing triple-digit growth. Recently, Alibaba announced that it will integrate its domestic Chinese and international e-commerce platforms into a single business unit (called the E-commerce Business Group) amid intense competition. The company aims to create synergies in its supply chain with this move. Reacting to this announcement, Citi analyst Alicia Yap reaffirmed a Buy rating on Alibaba stock and stated that she views the announcement positively. The analyst, who has a price target of $133 on BABA stock, noted that this step could fuel synergies across Alibaba’s Taobao Tmall Group and the International Digital Commerce Group, driving improvement in operations and financial performance. Overall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks, backed by 14 Buys versus one Hold rating. The average BABA stock price target of $127.05 implies about 45% upside potential. See more BABA analyst ratings Wall Street is highly bullish on Alibaba and Nvidia stocks but cautiously optimistic about Apple. Analysts see higher upside potential in Alibaba stock than in the stocks of the other two tech giants, thanks to improving fundamentals, AI-related prospects, and the Chinese government’s stimulus measures. Interestingly, as per TipRanks’ Smart Score System, both Alibaba and Nvidia score a “Perfect 10,” implying that both these stocks are well-positioned to outperform the broader market over the long term.

The Nasdaq outperformsU.S. stocks ended Friday mixed. The S&P 500 was flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% for its seventh straight day of losses and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.12%. Shares of Broadcom jumped 24%, launching it into the trillion-dollar market capitalization club. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 fell 0.53% to end the week in the red, snapping a three-week winning streak. OpenAI opens up about MuskOpenAI co-founder Elon Musk pushed to create a new for-profit structure for the company in 2017, OpenAI alleged in a blog post. However, "when he didn't get majority equity and full control, he walked away," wrote OpenAI alongside screenshots of Musk's email. In November, Musk asked a federal court to block OpenAI from converting to a for-profit entity. Tech companies donate to TrumpTechnology companies that have a history of clashes with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump are donating to his inauguration. Meta donated $1 million, the company confirmed to CNBC, Amazon is planning to donate the same amount, according to The Wall Street Journal and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is making a personal donation also of the same amount, according to the company. South Korea president impeachedSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached on Saturday after 204 lawmakers in the National Assembly voted in favor of the motion. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will serve as acting president. On Sunday, Han spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden, and the country's finance ministry said it would continue monitoring markets. [PRO] Eyes on rates and pricesInterest rates and inflation are in focus this week. The U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting meeting ends Wednesday, while the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation because it reflects how consumers actually spend money, comes out on Friday. A near-surefire of figuring out where markets are heading is to make a prediction — and disregard it. The S&P 500 may have slipped 0.6% last week, snapping its three-week winning streak. But it's still up almost 27% this year, shattering the 6,000 level for the first time on its journey upward. That's way ahead of forecasts made by top financial strategists at the end of 2023, notes CNBC's Pia Singh. JPMorgan's chief U.S. equity strategist, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, for instance, expected the broad-based index to close the year at just 4,200. Even the most optimistic prediction — a 5,200 target from John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer — didn't capture the exuberant stock rally this year. And that's why even though market strategists anticipate the S&P to finish 2025 at 6,630, according to the average forecast from the CNBC Market Strategist Survey, investors should take it with a pinch of salt. Granted, there's positive sentiment bubbling among investors, thanks to Trump's high regard for the stock market as a barometer for his presidential tenure, steadily loosening monetary policy, the prospect of lower corporate taxes, among other factors. But, in markets — as in life — the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry. Inflation might make an unwelcome return — like measles and possibly polio in the U.S. — because of Trump's promised tariffs and the tit-for-tat trade wars that could ensue. Indeed, inflation already "looks a little stuck," said Goldman Sachs' vice chairman Robert Kaplan, previously president of the Dallas Fed. Still, despite my skepticism of predictions, I'd love it if Bank of America's Savita Subramanian proves to be a prescient market forecaster. Imagine ending 2025 with the S&P at Subramanian's target of 6,666. — CNBC's Sarah Min, Pia Singh, Sean Conlon and Samantha Subin contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Hackaday Links: December 15, 2024

It looks like we won’t have Cruise to kick around in this space anymore with the news that General Motors is pulling the plug on its woe-beset robotaxi project. Cruise, which GM acquired in 2016, fielded autonomous vehicles in various test markets, but the fleet racked up enough high-profile mishaps (first item) for California regulators to shut down test programs in the state last year. The inevitable layoffs ensued, and GM is now killing off its efforts to build robotaxis to concentrate on incorporating the Cruise technology into its “Super Cruise” suite of driver-assistance features for its full line of cars and trucks. We feel like this might be a tacit admission that surmounting the problems of fully autonomous driving is just too hard a nut to crack profitably with current technology, since Super Cruise uses eye-tracking cameras to make sure the driver is paying attention to the road ahead when automation features are engaged. Basically, GM is admitting there still needs to be meat in the seat, at least for now. Speaking of accidents, the results of the first aircraft accident investigation on another world were released this week, and there were a few surprises. Ingenuity, the little helicopter that hitched a ride to Mars in the belly of the Perseverance rover in 2021, surpassed all expectations by completing 71 flights successfully and becoming an integral part of the search for ancient life on Mars. But flight 72 proved to be a bridge too far and ended with a hard landing that terminally damaged its rotor system. At the time it was speculated that the relatively bland terrain it was flying over at the time of the accident was the root cause. This was confirmed by analysis of the flight logs, but the degree to which the flight computer’s down-looking navigation camera was confused by the featureless dunes is new information. As for why the rotor blades broke, it doesn’t appear that it was because they impacted the surface. Rather, as Scott Manley points out, the blades appear to have broken at their weakest point due to extreme flexing induced by the high vertical speed while touching down on a slope, which caused one set of legs to hit the surface before the others. Also roughly in the realm of space-based failures comes the story of a hapless senior citizen in New York who has been issued thousands of dollars in traffic tickets because of her love for Star Trek. Years ago, Long Island resident Beda Koorey got a New York vanity license plate for her car emblazoned with “NCC-1701,” the registration number of the USS Enterprise. She turned in those plates years ago when she gave up driving, but in the meantime, novelty NCC-1701 plates began popping up on Amazon and other sites. They were clearly not intended to be used on cars, but that didn’t stop some people from putting them on over their real plates in an attempt to defeat traffic cameras. It worked, at least from their point of view, since it left poor Beda with a collection of tickets for speeding and red light violations from as far away as Chicago. She even got a ticket for a violation committed by a motorcycle with a phony plate, which you think would not map to the registration for an automobile, but there you go. We always knew it was hard to be a Trekkie, especially back in the ’70s, but at least it never cost us much money. It did cost us a lot of dates, though. We featured plenty of stories of start-up tech companies with the next must-have IoT device that fold up shop after a few years and abandon their users by effectively bricking their widgets. Heck, we’ve even suffered that fate ourselves; curse you, Logitech, for killing the SqueezeBox. However, one company recently took IoT bricking to a new low by ending support for a line of AI-powered companion bots for kids. The company was called Embodied, and they hawked $800 AI bots for kids called Moxie, with a cute face and a huggable form factor that kids couldn’t help falling in love with. Embodied couldn’t make a go of it financially and since Moxie uses a cloud-based LLM to interact with kids, the bots are now bricked. This leaves parents who invested in these devices with the quandary of having to explain to young kids that their robot pal is dead. Some of the TikToks of parents breaking the news are heartbreaking, and we can’t help but think that this is a perfect opportunity for someone in our community to reverse-engineer these things and bring them back to life. And finally, the burning of the Yule Log is an ancient tradition, one that reminds us of the time our grandfather brought an entire telephone pole that had washed up on the beach home and burned it for days on end, feeding it slowly into the fireplace in the living room through the open front door. Good times. Not everyone is blessed with a fireplace in their abode, though, which has given rise to the popularity of video Yule Logs that you can just play on your TV. And now NASA is in on the action with an eight-hour 4K video of the SLS main engines and boosters. Framed by a lovely stone fireplace and replete with crackling wood sound effects over the subdued roar of the four RS-25 engines and twin solid-fuel boosters, it’ll make a nice addition to your holiday festivities. Although given that NASA just announced that the next Artemis missions are delayed until at least 2026, we’re not sure that it’s a great idea to show a rocket that never lifts off. You’ll also want to be careful that the neighbors don’t see the action. CGI fireplace, NASA, you can do better than that. They tried it with a real fireplace but it melted the house. Not just CGI, but really bad AI-generated fireplace. I just love a fireplace with a comforting basket of amorphous beige shapes in front, and a lumpy grate…thing… glued to the wall. The actual video footage is also only about three seconds being looped. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL9-YhsEcQo Last year they did one that was just 45 minutes of RS-25 test footage with generic holiday music, which was honestly better. It seems like NASA has fired enough engines that it shouldn’t be hard to find a rocket engine filmed at a ridiculously high framerate so they could stretch a ten-second test into an hour or two of slow-motion. Could the air accident investigation be considered complete if JPL hasn’t recovered the “black box”? Mars doesn’t have much of an atmosphere, so they just have to get it all out of thin air :o) You win. I was in SF a little while ago and was surprised to see that what seemed like every third car was a driverless Waymo or whatever they are called. So full driverless is absolutely still a thing and not at all impossible with current tech. Which really surprised me because I thought California banned all driverless cars.

Title: What You Need To Know If You're Considering A Job Change
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2024/12/15/considering-a-job-change-in-2025/

A growing number of employees are ready to make a job change. Recent Gallup data reveals that more Americans are considering a job change than at any point in the last 10 years. U.S. employees feel increasingly frustrated and detached from their work—something Gallup calls the "Great Detachment." Even more interesting, a PwC survey conducted among over 56,000 workers in 50 countries shows that 28% of respondents are likely to change companies within the next 12 months. A growing number of employees are planning a job change due to increased workloads and the desire to improve their skills. “Employee desires to job-switch will be driven by a multitude of reasons, but notably this year, two-thirds who said they are likely to switch in the next 12 months said opportunities to learn new skills are a key factor...,” said Pete Brown, Global Workforce Leader at PwC UK. Other reasons to consider a job switch are fewer promotions, smaller raises and impending layoffs. Despite feeling stuck in dissatisfying roles, many people are waiting to make a move until they feel more confident about their future prospects. In the meantime, a number of workers have already started job searching. The perfect time to switch jobs may be just around the corner. If you’re restless in your current role and ready to make a job change, here’s what you need to know. With the U.S. election over, companies that paused planning have the clarity they need to make budget and hiring decisions for 2025. Some experts predict a slow resurgence with a more robust jobs market in Q3. “My expectation is that by Q2 we will start to see a slight pickup, and, by Q3, we will be in a pretty robust jobs market,” says Rajesh Namboothiry, SVP at Manpower. Recruiters also remain optimistic, with seven in 10 remaining confident about job growth and hiring demand in the next 12 months, according to a recent Recruiter.com and Findem survey. That’s great news for those individuals planning a job change. In ManpowerGroup’s 2024 Global Talent Shortage report, 75% of companies globally report having difficulty finding skilled talent. The skills shortage is caused mainly by rapid technological advancements, like generative AI. With innovative technological solutions emerging, new skills are required to operate them. As a result, organizations in various industries like healthcare, technology and engineering are turning to new-collar workers to fill critical skill gaps. A new-collar job refers to positions prioritizing skills over a traditional four-year college degree. People often develop these specialized skill sets through non-traditional education paths like boot camps, certification programs or on-the-job training. Some employers are even training their current workforce to fill these positions. While some high-profile organizations like Starbucks, Amazon and others issue return-to-office mandates, others are open to more flexible options. Research and advisory firm Metrigy recently released their Employee Engagement Optimization 2025 study, indicating that employers are modifying their strategies to strike the right balance between on-site and remote work. In 2025, over half of those surveyed plan to adjust their requirements to balance the need for internal collaboration with what employees want. In fact, structured hybrid models following a predefined schedule continue to grow in popularity. According to the Flex Index Q4 2024 Flex Report, 43% of U.S. firms now have a structured hybrid model—up from 20% in 2023. As AI and other technologies reshape industries, leaders increasingly recognize the importance of hiring professionals with soft skills. In LinkedIn’s recent Global Talent Trends report, 69% of U.S. executives say they plan to prioritize hiring candidates with these skills. Unlike technical skills, soft skills can’t be outsourced to AI and are highly transferable across functions and industries. These assets are also a powerful differentiator during job interviews. When hiring managers are choosing between two strong candidates with equal technical skills, soft skills are often the deciding factor. Workplace advisory platform meQuilibrium predicts that there will be a “manager crash” or a significant decline in manager performance and well-being in 2025. Over the past several years, companies have been engaged in reducing headcount, particularly middle managers. For example, Citigroup reduced 13 management layers to eight, while Amazon announced plans to increase its ratio of workers to supervisors by at least 15%. Most companies don’t intend to fill those roles, making it challenging for the remaining supervisors. The managers left behind take on much larger workloads and become increasingly disengaged. In addition, the lack of adequate company support puts managers at a higher risk of burnout and turnover than the people they supervise. If you intend to make a job change, focus on developing technical skills in high-demand areas. Also, prioritize building critical soft skills like adaptability, creative problem solving and collaboration. Stay updated on industry trends, network with thought leaders and evaluate your personal brand to give yourself a competitive edge. By planning strategically, you’ll go from feeling stuck to taking your career to a whole new level. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. –Hosea 8:7 Welp, here we are, at the far end of 2024. I thought I was being overwrought back at the end of 2023, worried about how bad things would be. And now, as 2024 closes out I can only conclude that I am always too optimistic in my takes. Pretty much everything turned out badly and the forecast is for much worse to come. 2024 banner courtesy of our daughter This is, of course, an annual exercise of sorts, so if you are interested in past attempt at predictions or prediction-like things, here is the record as it stands: Now it is time to see how I did for 2024. The rule is that if it doesn’t happen by December 15th, it doesn’t count. (And I had one come to pass on Friday, just two days ahead of the deadline. Go me.) How clear was my vision back at the dawn of the new year? All predictions are worth 10 points unless otherwise noted, with partial credit available for scenarios where a prediction has multiple facets. So what was I thinking about nearly a year ago? 1 – Microsoft Buyers Remorse Everything with Microsoft and XBox was rainbows and lollipops at BlizzCon but, having closed the deal, now MSFT is going to need to deal with the reality. And the reality is that they are going to behave like every other large game studio has been and lay a bunch of people off. Microsoft has already severely trimmed some of its other companies, like LinkedIn, so it will be Blizz next. Granted, there was always going to be some redundancy trimmed, but MSFT will got further and will axe a couple hundred people working on active Blizz projects in 2024 I am going to give myself 10 points here. They slashed 1,900 people before the ink was even dry on this post and cut the unnamed survival game and all the staff working on it. Just another day in the industry where a massive bloodletting was the plan all along. 2 – Activision Settlement Woes Activision Blizzard may have settled with the state of California over harassment and discrimination charges, but they still have a laundry list of changes they have promised to make… and they’ll drag their feet on that until the state has to come after them again. California will need to get in there in order to force compliance with the agreed upon terms before the end of 2024. This was all disappeared into the maw of the Microsoft beast. Once digested it was available for inaccurate regurgitation via Copilot. Zero points. 3 – The War Within Launch Date I am going to put my money on September 9/10 as the world-wide release date for The War Within, and as I usually do, the accounting for points will be minus two for every week off I am. Well, the general release was August 26/27, so I was off by two weeks, so 6 points for me. 4 – The War Within Reception Fair to middling. Hopes of that the start of this three parter will bestir the fan base and drive people back to retail will… if not fall flat, will be a repeat of Dragonflight. Shadowland killed off retail for too many people and WoW Classic was there to catch them. Retail WoW is a foreign country to many now. It won’t fail or anything, but it will be akin to what we just saw where the launch will generate no “best ever!” press release and they will be giving out free weekends and discounted pricing within a month. The reviews are good for TWW, so that part I did not get. On the flip side, there was no “best ever!” press release about the launch and discounts landed pretty early. I am going to give myself 5 points and declare that WoW Classic has fractured the audience, and never will they be rejoined… until the classic servers catch up to retail I guess. Hoo boy. 5 – Cataclysm Classic Launch Date I am going to put my money on July 15/16 as the world-wide release date for Cataclysm Classic and, as above, the accounting for points will be minus two for every week off I am. Cata Classic landed in freaking May, so zero points for me on that front. 6 – Pandamonium I don’t think Cataclysm Classic will be the disaster some think it will be, but I also don’t think it is going to hold player attention for as long as Wrath Classic managed. Blizz will announce Mists of Pandaria Classic at BlizzCon and the implication will be that Cata Classic will last less than a year all told. I guess I could fret about the fact that there was no BlizzCon 2024… didn’t predict that… but the substitute, the Warcraft Direct presentation, did announced we would be getting Pandas soon, if not soon enough. 10 points. 7 – Season of Discovery Rug Pull Blizz will get to the end of the vanilla content with Season of Discovery and announce that they will be shutting off the servers because it is over. This will annoy players who were invested in the whole thing or who were still holding out hope for Classic Plus. As with Season of Mastery, when Blizzard uses the word “season” they mean “temporary.” Blizz actually got the memo from the last season server they killed off and declared at the Warcraft Direct that they would not being doing this sort of rug pull. Good for them. Zero points. 8 – Diablo IV Expansion We will get the expected content update in Q2 2024, with May 23/24 being the world wide launch date. The usual “off by weeks” rule above applies. Not even close. Zero points. 9 – Blizz and the Unnamed Survival Title It will remain unnamed and unremarked upon in 2024. Nothing to see here. I have to give myself a big zero points on this one, if only because it was remarked on when Microsoft gave it the axe. 10 – World of Warcraft Celebrates 20 Years World of Warcraft will hit its 20 year anniversary in November. As such, I am going to throw out a few bullet points, worth five points each, should they come to pass. That is a possible 35 points in play. Is Classic Classic a new flavor? I am going to say yes, which gives me 20 points. 11 – The Year of EverQuest The Norrath titles, EverQuest and EverQuest II, are turning 25 and 20 respectively in 2024. As such, Daybreak will have some big plans or some such. No doubt the EverQuest II anniversary will be overshadowed by WoW, but it will still be a thing. As above, I am going to throw out some bullet points that are worth five points each should they come to pass. That is a possible 30 points in play, but I only managed 15 points on this one. 12 – Daybreak Un-Announcements Last year we got low key announcements that there were H1Z1 and EverQuest titles in the offing. My guess is that Daybreak is going to walk one of those back, either removing it from their plans entirely or pushing back any previously planned dates by at least two years. And you know what, I am going to demand double points if they do it for both. How do you like them apples? Well, I get zero points because they did neither. Both were mentioned, but only in the vaguest possible terms. 13 – LOTRO No Closer to 4K Support Meanwhile, over at the Standing Stone group at Daybreak, they are going to potter merrily along with content updates and cash shop items and they are not going to do one thing to further the cause of 4K video support for the game. After seven years of “we’ll get to it” I view this as a gimme, a free ten points, and I dare SSG to prove me wrong! As expected, an absolute gimme. This is nowhere on their roadmap and seems unlikely ever to come to pass. 10 points. 14 – Consoles for Some but not All In 2024 DC Universe Online will become a native PlayStation 5 application… and PlanetSide 2 will not. Oh, and it goes without saying that the idea of LOTRO on consoles will never be mentioned again by Daybreak/EG7… but I said it anyway! I’ll even give myself NEGATIVE ten points if LOTRO on consoles is mentioned in any way save for announcing it won’t happen. That should offset #12. As expected DCUO, the gross revenue champion at Daybreak, went live on the PlayStation 5 as a native app… and PlanetSide 2 got… um… moved to Frogman? And nobody said nuttin’ about no LOTRO on consoles. A dead idea. 10 points for me. 15 – EVE Online Expansion Dreams CCP, having tasted success from three Faction Warfare expansions in a row will roll the dice on that again for its mid-year expansion, but that will fail to keep the proverbial summer slump from hitting the way Viridian prevented it. No, they came for null sec this time with Equinox. While online numbers were not down to pre-Havoc levels, there was still a bit of a summer slump. So, maybe 2 points for me on that. 16 – EVE Vanguard Launch Date I don’t know when it will officially be live, but it won’t be in 2024. There will be more live tests and some form of early access, but it will still be in the gray zone between testing and a live launch come the end of the year. I am going to give myself half credit it it does fully launch in 2024, but not until November and eight points if it lands in December. In mid-November they were saying EVE Vanguard was “Still in early development” in official announcements. I am prepared to re-roll this prediction for 2025. 10 points. 17 – EVE Galaxy Conquest’s Fate The new mobile title announced at Fanfest, EVE Galaxy Conquest, will launch then fade so fast in the sea of mobile titles out there that the promise of a PC version will never come to pass. That will be a shame, because EVE Online has an older demographic that would really dig into a strategic, 4x PC title set in New Eden. Half credit if it doesn’t launch at all in 2024. It did launch, I did try it, it did fail to impress, so I am going to give myself 10 points and dare anybody to prove me wrong. The proverbial stone in the pond that left not a ripple. 18 – EVE War for New Eden The EVE Online board game. I feel this was announced prematurely. There was no benefit from breaking that news before Fanfest unless the Kickstarter was ready to go. And given the dearth of information available so far, I am going to predict that the Kickstarter won’t go live before June 1st and if you pledge to get a copy it won’t arrive in time for Christmas. Well, the Kickstarter campaign was off and running well before June 1st, but there looks to be no sign of shipping by Christmas. 5 points. 19 – Project Awakening It won’t ship in 2024, but we will get a preview and it will be a weakly revamped version of EVE Online that puts all in game items on the blockchain and will feature a new currency that a16z will own. The only people who will be excited by this are people invested in blockchain because this will be entirely about that technology and not at all about game play. (Which is the perennial fault of all of these crypto projects. Also, play to earn is a garbage idea and will never succeed in the long term, being a completely untenable economic idea.) As with EVE: Galaxy Conquest, I am going to claim full credit because what little CCP has shared has all been cope and BS. Bad idea was bad. 10 points. 20 – Camelot Unhinged It is always an easy one, predicting that Camelot Unchained won’t ship. It has been good for almost a decade. (Beta 1 access, promised for February 2015, still not a thing.) So let’s dial that up a notch. Not only will it not ship in 2024, it also won’t be available for any sort of general access beta for backers (staged, one weekend, events don’t count), and Marc Jacobs is going to announce a THIRD title his team is working on. Two out of three isn’t bad, considering I was pretty much making up that third one as a dare to the universe. I will take 6 points (didn’t ship, not general access for backers) and be on my way. 21 – Starved Citizen Chris Roberts will stumble this year, announcing something that will end up being a step too far for all but his most die hard adherents. Second and third quarter revenues will fall short by year over year measures. But then he’ll announce some crazy new feature at CitizenCon… zero G sex or a psychedelic asteroid mining colony option or maybe actual in game psychedelics… and things will recover in the fourth quarter. Depending heavily on The Nosy Gamer to keep me honest on this one with his reporting. I don’t even know why I made this prediction, I don’t care enough about it to even pay attention. Zero points unless somebody tells me I was on to something in the comments. 22 – Pantheon Something Something Something Visionary Realms will make a huge mistake and ship something this year. I say “mistake” because they have managed to survive on selling vision… hey, it is literally in their name… but when the rubber finally hits the road… oh my. It might only be early access to Pantheon, but it will be generally available and the reaction will be muted and panic will set in at the company as they find out that nostalgia has problems interacting with reality. December early access on a somewhat bland offering. I get at least 5 points for that… mostly because it launched two days ago so panic hasn’t had time to hit. 23 – Random Shot at Ubisoft Just because I’ve set some personal record for grudges against a company when it comes to Ubisoft… a record achieved largely by them renewing my ire pretty much annually. So Ubisoft will do something in 2024 that will enrage players/fans/gamers or whoever and I will renew my vow to never buy another game from them again. Also, water will be wet and the sun will continue to rise in the east. I was kind of worried about this one because it would require me to pay some attention to Ubisoft, which I generally only do under duress. But then their CEO called Skull & Bones a four-A game (that is one A better than triple-A right?) to justify its price point and I was annoyed and then gave myself 10 points. And then more stuff happened that would have counted. This was even more of a gimme than I expected it would be. 24 – Metaversary Stories In the smoking remains of the metaverse hype of 2022, here is how the few remaining contenders will fare in 2024. Each bullet point is worth 5 points. 25 points total in play here. Man, Zuck is still pouring money into Horizon Worlds. Unbelievable. The team is clearly in panic mode and it won’t last forever, but it lasted until December 15th. 0 points If Decentraland shut down would anybody even notice? Can you prove it is still there? Is it even worth the effort? It isn’t worth the points for me to find out. 0 points. Playable Worlds delivered some design philosophy… and then some pre-Alpha stuff for testers to work with… with only a partial NDA. Better than Mark Jacobs has managed. 0 points. I mean, there are no VentureBeat headlines about the metaverse anymore, those being all about AI this year. But they still put out a weekly newsletter about it. That is worth at least 1 point. Finally, no coherent definition was kind of a gimme, so gimme my 5 points. 25 – Virtual Banality Virtual Reality will remain a niche market, giving lie to all those optimistic growth charts of the last dozen years, with sales of VR hardware actually declining in 2024. There is so much obfuscation on this that I cannot, in good faith, give myself full points. To start with, 2024 isn’t done yet. But, also, I can find contradictory charts and forecasts claiming sales have been both up or maybe down after peaking in 2021. But it is still a niche market, so I am taking 1 point for that with a promise not to make a prediction like this again next year. 26 – Pokemon Go to the Moon! Pokemon Go will release an update that will increase the level cap to 60, with the experience point gap between 59 and 60 being ONE BILLION. This will be the classic blunder of hurting all the normies… I friend online so many casual players on community days that are mid-30s to low-40s… because a tiny percentage of the player base hit 50 too quickly. The rumors proved false. Pokemon Go introduced a few new updates, but no level cap increase. Zero points. 27 – Destination Steam The following Blizzard titles will end up on Steam in 2024. Five points per correct guess. 25 points in play here… and zero points earned. Got soaked on that one I guess. 28 – Destination XBox The following Blizzard titles will end up in the XBox PC store… not necessarily on Game Pass, but available for purchase or subscription through Microsoft’s XBox store front for your PC. 30 points in play here, and I am good for 20 points out of that list, with the titles in bold available. I was dumb to add the others since they don’t have an upfront box cost. 29 – Pax Dei Pax Dei will end up reneging on their “no NPCs” plan once they get into early access… so I guess part of this prediction is that they will get to early access this year… because somebody will recall how hard CCP had to work to bootstrap a player economy into existence even with NPCs as part of their plan. Their player run sandbox idea will shamble along until they do this. Another game I thought I might pay attention to. No chance. But their FAQ still says no NPCs. I am not sure why I cared enough to make this prediction now. Zero points. 30 – Tarislandia While some members of the gaming press have been falling all over themselves to dismiss Tarisland a WoW clone, even idiotically suggesting it somehow sprang fully formed into existence when WoW lost its partner in China… those diabolical Chinese planned it this way all along… when it finally ships this year… there is part of the prediction… people will change their tune and will declare it is more of a Lost Ark clone… or anything besides being the cheap copy of WoW that it was so aggressively painted as in the press. I fear this prediction suffers greatly from the phenomena I refer to as “nobody gives a shit.” If you insist it is a WoW clone, then pretty much any fantasy MMORPG launched after WoW fits the bill. And if it isn’t… I don’t know, what is a WoW clone anyway? I’m going to give myself 1 point for even caring enough to write that much about it. 31 – Just Won’t Ship As the heading says, these titles won’t ship in 2024. For purposes of this prediction, remaining in alpha or beta means the ship metric was not met, but I am going to say that paid early access counts as shipping, because screw anybody who tries to take money AND deflect issues. This is five points per bullet point. 40 points overall on that one. Bonus Predictions These are the crazy fringe guesses that have no basis in reality, but I get 10 additional points if one of them actually comes to pass. Richard “Lord British” Garriott will announce that his blockchain shambles of a project will be driven by AI, because that buzzword is still active and must remain active until he jumps on the bandwagon, which is always the sign that the gold rush is over and we need to move on. No, but he is once again claiming that through some magic he will once again gain control of Ultima Online or the Ultima franchise or some deluded fart sniffing BS. What would he even do with it if he got it? Why does he have to try to be relevant while completely failing to be relevant? Zero points. That third title that City State Entertainment announces in 2024 will be blockchain driven because Mark Jacobs will have been offered a wad of money, the way CCP has, to make a title using the technology. It will be the final sell out and he will never ship another game in his lifetime. I mean, I think the last sentence is still likely correct, and that includes the as yet unshipped Camelot Unchained. But he lives yet, so zero points. Peter Molyneux’s Project MOAT will be announced as a blockchain, AI driven, multiverse vision… if it isn’t all that already. I cannot be bothered to check. I have just seen a few headlines, which is more than it deserves. This almost seems like a gimme at this point in his career. I am hoping Conner at MMO Fallout will keep me honest here. Molyneaux has been surprisingly contrite and grounded this year… I mean, relative to past behavior, to be fair… so he hasn’t sparked much outrage that I have seen. Certainly not blockchain levels of outrage. Zero points. Somebody will notice that CCP’s promise that its skill point packs are “once per account” is meaningless when they just change up the packs every month or so, meaning that there is effectively no limit over time. I will deduct zero points if I am the source of this discovery. I am allowed to set fires too! This probably only mattered to me… and it did not even matter to me really. CCP sells skill points. CCP hands skill points out like candy. Skill points aren’t a story anymore… unless you don’t have enough to fit that new hull you bought. Zero points and zero interest from anybody. I feel like I could do a whole Twitter predictions post, but I am going to just predict that Elon is going to loudly threaten bankruptcy by the end of 2024 to keep creditors at bay. Muskovites have been smug about him having those foolish enough to finance the deal by the balls following the old saw about “Borrow a thousand dollars and the bank owns, borrow a billion dollars and you own the bank,” but Musk put up Tesla stock as collateral and if he isn’t making his payments they can declare default and take the stock. Musk won’t like that, and bankruptcy won’t stop it in the long term, but the mention of bankruptcy will introduce delay and chaos, which is all he’ll want out of it. He won’t actually declare bankruptcy since he is convinced that would make his penis shrink further. He jumped fully on board the Trump train and ended up a made man… or clown… or whatever he is. I should be happy I didn’t do any other Twitter predictions as I was clearly too optimistic. Zero points, despite what a clown he is. All of that added up to a possible total 450 points, plus a potential 50 bonus points for wild ass guesses… none of which panned out, so we can discard those. Out of that, I count a total of 212 points awarded by me to myself, which makes me about a 47% correct on predictions… which is honestly a lot better than I usually do. I think my past peak was 43%, while I am usually down in the 20% range. I guess my favorite quote it true. Always predict the worst and you’ll be hailed as a prophet. -Tom Lehrer, quoting a friend Now what will I see when looking forward into 2025? Can I manage it? Can I bear it? I always enjoy these posts, coming and going. This one is intersting for how many gaming-related things that seemed important a year ago seem completely irrelevant now. Tarisland? We cared about that? The Metaverse? Does anyone remember it? Pantheon is still interesting, though. I wonder what counts as “success” there? It’s nice that they’re on Steam because we get hard numbers and for an indie project they aren’t that bad at this very early stage: a couple of thousand people playing concurrently and that number slightly rising still. And the game is available directly through Visionary Realms, of course, so maybe they have double that, which by the old 3x rule means something like 10-12k players, which could be viable, always assuming they have a way to get more money out of them. I suspect they might end up with a low-end, sustainable MMORPG, which puts them a long way ahead of many of their erstwhile behind-closed-doors competitors. Camelot Unchained is just a fever dream now, isn’t it? LikeLiked by 1 person I was thinking that last night, about how much this post is a reflection of my state of mind related the meta of the industry and video games in general. But I also think I have said something along those lines in the past, that these are less about being right and more about what is going on in my head. I’ve also never quite decided if my being correct is a good thing or a bad thing. Well, in two weeks or so you can see what is what in my brain once more. Camelot Unchained… I don’t even know what it is now. The team, as I have noted in the past, write bubbling happy updates every month about how great everything is going as though they have a live game in production and not just a bunch of code… one assumes there is some code out there somewhere… that no end user has ever been allowed to play. It is bordering on North Korea levels of propaganda. LikeLike Oh, I laughed at the Star Citizen predictions because on the financial side you got almost everything wrong. For the second and third quarters sales were up 13% each quarter. And while you were right about Roberts announcing something crazy at CitizenCon, CIG needs $11 million in the next 2 weeks to match Q4 2023 and $8.5 million to match last year’s total. Not happening. If all the blockchain/crypto stuff weren’t happening, I’d ask if your faith in humanity was restored. LikeLike Classic catching up to live would mean a shadowlands classic…. ugh and I thought cats classic would be bad. LikeLike IKR? That is where I got off the retail bus the first time around. Maybe if they could keep it to under a year and I could just get to level cap and ignore the insane Toghast grind. But, given how Cata Classic has gone, the won’t want us to miss a beat of the classic Shadowlands experience. But at the current rate of rolling classic forward we have a few years before it becomes an issue. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

They slashed 1,900 people before the ink was even dry on this post and cut the unnamed survival game and all the staff working on it. Just another day in the industry where a massive bloodletting was the plan all along. 2 – Activision Settlement Woes Activision Blizzard may have settled with the state of California over harassment and discrimination charges, but they still have a laundry list of changes they have promised to make… and they’ll drag their feet on that until the state has to come after them again. California will need to get in there in order to force compliance with the agreed upon terms before the end of 2024. This was all disappeared into the maw of the Microsoft beast. Once digested it was available for inaccurate regurgitation via Copilot. Zero points. 3 – The War Within Launch Date I am going to put my money on September 9/10 as the world-wide release date for The War Within, and as I usually do, the accounting for points will be minus two for every week off I am. Well, the general release was August 26/27, so I was off by two weeks, so 6 points for me. 4 – The War Within Reception Fair to middling.

Shadowland killed off retail for too many people and WoW Classic was there to catch them. Retail WoW is a foreign country to many now. It won’t fail or anything, but it will be akin to what we just saw where the launch will generate no “best ever!” press release and they will be giving out free weekends and discounted pricing within a month. The reviews are good for TWW, so that part I did not get. On the flip side, there was no “best ever!” press release about the launch and discounts landed pretty early. I am going to give myself 5 points and declare that WoW Classic has fractured the audience, and never will they be rejoined… until the classic servers catch up to retail I guess. Hoo boy. 5 – Cataclysm Classic Launch Date I am going to put my money on July 15/16 as the world-wide release date for Cataclysm Classic and, as above, the accounting for points will be minus two for every week off I am. Cata Classic landed in freaking May, so zero points for me on that front. 6 – Pandamonium I don’t think Cataclysm Classic will be the disaster some think it will be, but I also don’t think it is going to hold player attention for as long as Wrath Classic managed. Blizz will announce Mists of Pandaria Classic at BlizzCon and the implication will be that Cata Classic will last less than a year all told. I guess I could fret about the fact that there was no BlizzCon 2024… didn’t predict that… but the substitute, the Warcraft Direct presentation, did announced we would be getting Pandas soon, if not soon enough. 10 points. 7 – Season of Discovery Rug Pull Blizz will get to the end of the vanilla content with Season of Discovery and announce that they will be shutting off the servers because it is over. This will annoy players who were invested in the whole thing or who were still holding out hope for Classic Plus. As with Season of Mastery, when Blizzard uses the word “season” they mean “temporary.” Blizz actually got the memo from the last season server they killed off and declared at the Warcraft Direct that they would not being doing this sort of rug pull. Good for them. Zero points. 8 – Diablo IV Expansion We will get the expected content update in Q2 2024, with May 23/24 being the world wide launch date. The usual “off by weeks” rule above applies. Not even close. Zero points. 9 – Blizz and the Unnamed Survival Title It will remain unnamed and unremarked upon in 2024. Nothing to see here. I have to give myself a big zero points on this one, if only because it was remarked on when Microsoft gave it the axe. 10 – World of Warcraft Celebrates 20 Years World of Warcraft will hit its 20 year anniversary in November. As such, I am going to throw out a few bullet points, worth five points each, should they come to pass. That is a possible 35 points in play. Is Classic Classic a new flavor? I am going to say yes, which gives me 20 points. 11 – The Year of EverQuest The Norrath titles, EverQuest and EverQuest II, are turning 25 and 20 respectively in 2024. As such, Daybreak will have some big plans or some such. No doubt the EverQuest II anniversary will be overshadowed by WoW, but it will still be a thing. As above, I am going to throw out some bullet points that are worth five points each should they come to pass. That is a possible 30 points in play, but I only managed 15 points on this one. 12 – Daybreak Un-Announcements Last year we got low key announcements that there were H1Z1 and EverQuest titles in the offing. My guess is that Daybreak is going to walk one of those back, either removing it from their plans entirely or pushing back any previously planned dates by at least two years. And you know what, I am going to demand double points if they do it for both. How do you like them apples? Well, I get zero points because they did neither. Both were mentioned, but only in the vaguest possible terms. 13 – LOTRO No Closer to 4K Support Meanwhile, over at the Standing Stone group at Daybreak, they are going to potter merrily along with content updates and cash shop items and they are not going to do one thing to further the cause of 4K video support for the game. After seven years of “we’ll get to it” I view this as a gimme, a free ten points, and I dare SSG to prove me wrong! As expected, an absolute gimme. This is nowhere on their roadmap and seems unlikely ever to come to pass. 10 points. 14 – Consoles for Some but not All In 2024 DC Universe Online will become a native PlayStation 5 application… and PlanetSide 2 will not. Oh, and it goes without saying that the idea of LOTRO on consoles will never be mentioned again by Daybreak/EG7… but I said it anyway! I’ll even give myself NEGATIVE ten points if LOTRO on consoles is mentioned in any way save for announcing it won’t happen. That should offset #12. As expected DCUO, the gross revenue champion at Daybreak, went live on the PlayStation 5 as a native app… and PlanetSide 2 got… um… moved to Frogman? And nobody said nuttin’ about no LOTRO on consoles. A dead idea. 10 points for me. 15 – EVE Online Expansion Dreams CCP, having tasted success from three Faction Warfare expansions in a row will roll the dice on that again for its mid-year expansion, but that will fail to keep the proverbial summer slump from hitting the way Viridian prevented it. No, they came for null sec this time with Equinox. While online numbers were not down to pre-Havoc levels, there was still a bit of a summer slump. So, maybe 2 points for me on that. 16 – EVE Vanguard Launch Date I don’t know when it will officially be live, but it won’t be in 2024. There will be more live tests and some form of early access, but it will still be in the gray zone between testing and a live launch come the end of the year. I am going to give myself half credit it it does fully launch in 2024, but not until November and eight points if it lands in December. In mid-November they were saying EVE Vanguard was “Still in early development” in official announcements. I am prepared to re-roll this prediction for 2025. 10 points. 17 – EVE Galaxy Conquest’s Fate The new mobile title announced at Fanfest, EVE Galaxy Conquest, will launch then fade so fast in the sea of mobile titles out there that the promise of a PC version will never come to pass. That will be a shame, because EVE Online has an older demographic that would really dig into a strategic, 4x PC title set in New Eden. Half credit if it doesn’t launch at all in 2024. It did launch, I did try it, it did fail to impress, so I am going to give myself 10 points and dare anybody to prove me wrong. The proverbial stone in the pond that left not a ripple. 18 – EVE War for New Eden The EVE Online board game. I feel this was announced prematurely. There was no benefit from breaking that news before Fanfest unless the Kickstarter was ready to go. And given the dearth of information available so far, I am going to predict that the Kickstarter won’t go live before June 1st and if you pledge to get a copy it won’t arrive in time for Christmas. Well, the Kickstarter campaign was off and running well before June 1st, but there looks to be no sign of shipping by Christmas. 5 points. 19 – Project Awakening It won’t ship in 2024, but we will get a preview and it will be a weakly revamped version of EVE Online that puts all in game items on the blockchain and will feature a new currency that a16z will own. The only people who will be excited by this are people invested in blockchain because this will be entirely about that technology and not at all about game play. (Which is the perennial fault of all of these crypto projects. Also, play to earn is a garbage idea and will never succeed in the long term, being a completely untenable economic idea.) As with EVE: Galaxy Conquest, I am going to claim full credit because what little CCP has shared has all been cope and BS. Bad idea was bad. 10 points. 20 – Camelot Unhinged It is always an easy one, predicting that Camelot Unchained won’t ship. It has been good for almost a decade. (Beta 1 access, promised for February 2015, still not a thing.) So let’s dial that up a notch. Not only will it not ship in 2024, it also won’t be available for any sort of general access beta for backers (staged, one weekend, events don’t count), and Marc Jacobs is going to announce a THIRD title his team is working on. Two out of three isn’t bad, considering I was pretty much making up that third one as a dare to the universe. I will take 6 points (didn’t ship, not general access for backers) and be on my way. 21 – Starved Citizen Chris Roberts will stumble this year, announcing something that will end up being a step too far for all but his most die hard adherents. Second and third quarter revenues will fall short by year over year measures. But then he’ll announce some crazy new feature at CitizenCon… zero G sex or a psychedelic asteroid mining colony option or maybe actual in game psychedelics… and things will recover in the fourth quarter. Depending heavily on The Nosy Gamer to keep me honest on this one with his reporting. I don’t even know why I made this prediction, I don’t care enough about it to even pay attention. Zero points unless somebody tells me I was on to something in the comments. 22 – Pantheon Something Something Something Visionary Realms will make a huge mistake and ship something this year. I say “mistake” because they have managed to survive on selling vision… hey, it is literally in their name… but when the rubber finally hits the road… oh my. It might only be early access to Pantheon, but it will be generally available and the reaction will be muted and panic will set in at the company as they find out that nostalgia has problems interacting with reality. December early access on a somewhat bland offering. I get at least 5 points for that… mostly because it launched two days ago so panic hasn’t had time to hit. 23 – Random Shot at Ubisoft Just because I’ve set some personal record for grudges against a company when it comes to Ubisoft… a record achieved largely by them renewing my ire pretty much annually. So Ubisoft will do something in 2024 that will enrage players/fans/gamers or whoever and I will renew my vow to never buy another game from them again. Also, water will be wet and the sun will continue to rise in the east. I was kind of worried about this one because it would require me to pay some attention to Ubisoft, which I generally only do under duress. But then their CEO called Skull & Bones a four-A game (that is one A better than triple-A right?) to justify its price point and I was annoyed and then gave myself 10 points. And then more stuff happened that would have counted. This was even more of a gimme than I expected it would be. 24 – Metaversary Stories In the smoking remains of the metaverse hype of 2022, here is how the few remaining contenders will fare in 2024. Each bullet point is worth 5 points. 25 points total in play here. Man, Zuck is still pouring money into Horizon Worlds. Unbelievable. The team is clearly in panic mode and it won’t last forever, but it lasted until December 15th. 0 points If Decentraland shut down would anybody even notice? Can you prove it is still there? Is it even worth the effort? It isn’t worth the points for me to find out. 0 points. Playable Worlds delivered some design philosophy… and then some pre-Alpha stuff for testers to work with… with only a partial NDA. Better than Mark Jacobs has managed. 0 points. I mean, there are no VentureBeat headlines about the metaverse anymore, those being all about AI this year. But they still put out a weekly newsletter about it. That is worth at least 1 point. Finally, no coherent definition was kind of a gimme, so gimme my 5 points. 25 – Virtual Banality Virtual Reality will remain a niche market, giving lie to all those optimistic growth charts of the last dozen years, with sales of VR hardware actually declining in 2024. There is so much obfuscation on this that I cannot, in good faith, give myself full points. To start with, 2024 isn’t done yet. But, also, I can find contradictory charts and forecasts claiming sales have been both up or maybe down after peaking in 2021. But it is still a niche market, so I am taking 1 point for that with a promise not to make a prediction like this again next year. 26 – Pokemon Go to the Moon! Pokemon Go will release an update that will increase the level cap to 60, with the experience point gap between 59 and 60 being ONE BILLION. This will be the classic blunder of hurting all the normies… I friend online so many casual players on community days that are mid-30s to low-40s… because a tiny percentage of the player base hit 50 too quickly. The rumors proved false. Pokemon Go introduced a few new updates, but no level cap increase. Zero points. 27 – Destination Steam The following Blizzard titles will end up on Steam in 2024. Five points per correct guess. 25 points in play here… and zero points earned. Got soaked on that one I guess. 28 – Destination XBox The following Blizzard titles will end up in the XBox PC store… not necessarily on Game Pass, but available for purchase or subscription through Microsoft’s XBox store front for your PC. 30 points in play here, and I am good for 20 points out of that list, with the titles in bold available. I was dumb to add the others since they don’t have an upfront box cost. 29 – Pax Dei Pax Dei will end up reneging on their “no NPCs” plan once they get into early access… so I guess part of this prediction is that they will get to early access this year… because somebody will recall how hard CCP had to work to bootstrap a player economy into existence even with NPCs as part of their plan. Their player run sandbox idea will shamble along until they do this. Another game I thought I might pay attention to. No chance. But their FAQ still says no NPCs. I am not sure why I cared enough to make this prediction now. Zero points. 30 – Tarislandia While some members of the gaming press have been falling all over themselves to dismiss Tarisland a WoW clone, even idiotically suggesting it somehow sprang fully formed into existence when WoW lost its partner in China… those diabolical Chinese planned it this way all along… when it finally ships this year… there is part of the prediction… people will change their tune and will declare it is more of a Lost Ark clone… or anything besides being the cheap copy of WoW that it was so aggressively painted as in the press. I fear this prediction suffers greatly from the phenomena I refer to as “nobody gives a shit.” If you insist it is a WoW clone, then pretty much any fantasy MMORPG launched after WoW fits the bill. And if it isn’t… I don’t know, what is a WoW clone anyway? I’m going to give myself 1 point for even caring enough to write that much about it. 31 – Just Won’t Ship As the heading says, these titles won’t ship in 2024. For purposes of this prediction, remaining in alpha or beta means the ship metric was not met, but I am going to say that paid early access counts as shipping, because screw anybody who tries to take money AND deflect issues. This is five points per bullet point. 40 points overall on that one. Bonus Predictions These are the crazy fringe guesses that have no basis in reality, but I get 10 additional points if one of them actually comes to pass. Richard “Lord British” Garriott will announce that his blockchain shambles of a project will be driven by AI, because that buzzword is still active and must remain active until he jumps on the bandwagon, which is always the sign that the gold rush is over and we need to move on. No, but he is once again claiming that through some magic he will once again gain control of Ultima Online or the Ultima franchise or some deluded fart sniffing BS. What would he even do with it if he got it? Why does he have to try to be relevant while completely failing to be relevant? Zero points. That third title that City State Entertainment announces in 2024 will be blockchain driven because Mark Jacobs will have been offered a wad of money, the way CCP has, to make a title using the technology. It will be the final sell out and he will never ship another game in his lifetime. I mean, I think the last sentence is still likely correct, and that includes the as yet unshipped Camelot Unchained. But he lives yet, so zero points. Peter Molyneux’s Project MOAT will be announced as a blockchain, AI driven, multiverse vision… if it isn’t all that already. I cannot be bothered to check. I have just seen a few headlines, which is more than it deserves. This almost seems like a gimme at this point in his career. I am hoping Conner at MMO Fallout will keep me honest here. Molyneaux has been surprisingly contrite and grounded this year… I mean, relative to past behavior, to be fair… so he hasn’t sparked much outrage that I have seen. Certainly not blockchain levels of outrage. Zero points. Somebody will notice that CCP’s promise that its skill point packs are “once per account” is meaningless when they just change up the packs every month or so, meaning that there is effectively no limit over time. I will deduct zero points if I am the source of this discovery. I am allowed to set fires too! This probably only mattered to me… and it did not even matter to me really. CCP sells skill points. CCP hands skill points out like candy. Skill points aren’t a story anymore… unless you don’t have enough to fit that new hull you bought. Zero points and zero interest from anybody. I feel like I could do a whole Twitter predictions post, but I am going to just predict that Elon is going to loudly threaten bankruptcy by the end of 2024 to keep creditors at bay. Muskovites have been smug about him having those foolish enough to finance the deal by the balls following the old saw about “Borrow a thousand dollars and the bank owns, borrow a billion dollars and you own the bank,” but Musk put up Tesla stock as collateral and if he isn’t making his payments they can declare default and take the stock. Musk won’t like that, and bankruptcy won’t stop it in the long term, but the mention of bankruptcy will introduce delay and chaos, which is all he’ll want out of it. He won’t actually declare bankruptcy since he is convinced that would make his penis shrink further. He jumped fully on board the Trump train and ended up a made man… or clown… or whatever he is. I should be happy I didn’t do any other Twitter predictions as I was clearly too optimistic. Zero points, despite what a clown he is. All of that added up to a possible total 450 points, plus a potential 50 bonus points for wild ass guesses… none of which panned out, so we can discard those. Out of that, I count a total of 212 points awarded by me to myself, which makes me about a 47% correct on predictions… which is honestly a lot better than I usually do. I think my past peak was 43%, while I am usually down in the 20% range. I guess my favorite quote it true. Always predict the worst and you’ll be hailed as a prophet. -Tom Lehrer, quoting a friend Now what will I see when looking forward into 2025? Can I manage it? Can I bear it? I always enjoy these posts, coming and going. This one is intersting for how many gaming-related things that seemed important a year ago seem completely irrelevant now. Tarisland? We cared about that? The Metaverse? Does anyone remember it? Pantheon is still interesting, though. I wonder what counts as “success” there? It’s nice that they’re on Steam because we get hard numbers and for an indie project they aren’t that bad at this very early stage: a couple of thousand people playing concurrently and that number slightly rising still. And the game is available directly through Visionary Realms, of course, so maybe they have double that, which by the old 3x rule means something like 10-12k players, which could be viable, always assuming they have a way to get more money out of them. I suspect they might end up with a low-end, sustainable MMORPG, which puts them a long way ahead of many of their erstwhile behind-closed-doors competitors. Camelot Unchained is just a fever dream now, isn’t it? LikeLiked by 1 person I was thinking that last night, about how much this post is a reflection of my state of mind related the meta of the industry and video games in general. But I also think I have said something along those lines in the past, that these are less about being right and more about what is going on in my head. I’ve also never quite decided if my being correct is a good thing or a bad thing. Well, in two weeks or so you can see what is what in my brain once more. Camelot Unchained… I don’t even know what it is now. The team, as I have noted in the past, write bubbling happy updates every month about how great everything is going as though they have a live game in production and not just a bunch of code… one assumes there is some code out there somewhere… that no end user has ever been allowed to play. It is bordering on North Korea levels of propaganda. LikeLike Oh, I laughed at the Star Citizen predictions because on the financial side you got almost everything wrong. For the second and third quarters sales were up 13% each quarter. And while you were right about Roberts announcing something crazy at CitizenCon, CIG needs $11 million in the next 2 weeks to match Q4 2023 and $8.5 million to match last year’s total. Not happening. If all the blockchain/crypto stuff weren’t happening, I’d ask if your faith in humanity was restored. LikeLike Classic catching up to live would mean a shadowlands classic…. ugh and I thought cats classic would be bad. LikeLike IKR? That is where I got off the retail bus the first time around. Maybe if they could keep it to under a year and I could just get to level cap and ignore the insane Toghast grind. But, given how Cata Classic has gone, the won’t want us to miss a beat of the classic Shadowlands experience. But at the current rate of rolling classic forward we have a few years before it becomes an issue. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: How AI energy demand in 2025 will put natural gas in the spotlight

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Natural gas (NG=F) prices are on track to close out the year in negative territory. But there's optimism for 2025, largely because of exports and more demand stemming from artificial intelligence. "We’re constructive on power, and because we’re constructive on power, we think natural gas is going to perform well," said Francisco Blanch, head of Bank of America's global commodities and derivatives research, during a recent energy outlook roundtable. Natural gas prices are down 13% year to date, largely because of milder winters and a supply glut. But industry watchers are betting on increasing gas exports and greater power demand from the on-shoring of manufacturing facilities and AI data centers. "These ... centers have to run 24/7," BofA's Blanch said. Power demand for data centers is expected to grow between 10% and 15% per year between now and 2030 — and that could account for up to 5% of total worldwide power demand by 2030. "[Natural gas] will allow the infrastructure to be built and let it power the generation plants to make electricity," Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, told Yahoo Finance. "Natural gas will be the fuel of the future," he added. Case in point: Energy equipment maker and servicing company GE Vernova (GEV) recently raised its projections for its gas turbines. "You think about the US, and between 40% to 45% of our electricity comes from gas power today, and we're about to go into a real load cycle," GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik recently told Yahoo Finance. "In the rest of the world, that number is closer to 25%. But as other parts of the world shift like the US has shifted — with things like coal to gas — the proportion of gas electricity will only grow." The erosion of regulation surrounding the energy business, which is anticipated under the new Trump administration, is also expected to benefit the industry. For example, the administration is expected to get rid of restrictions surrounding liquified natural gas (LNG) export permits and pipeline projects. "Regulations act as an added cost," said Philip Rossetti, a resident senior fellow at the right-leaning R Street Institute. "If you're expecting less regulation you're probably going to be expecting more profitability." Oklahoma-based natural gas processing and transportation company the Williams Companies (WMB) and oil and gas midstream operator Oneok (OKE) are both up more than 40% year to date. Meanwhile, US LNG exports are expected to rise 15% next year, according to government data, as Europe continues to build storage capacity to reduce its dependence on Russia amid the Ukraine war. S&P Global Commodity Insights predicts prices at Henry Hub, the main futures contracts delivery point, will average more than $4.00 per million metric British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2025 after two years averaging below $3.00/MMBtu. "The uptick in exports will put significant strain on the domestic US natural gas market," the organization's 2025 energy outlook report said. Still, some Wall Street analysts believe the full impact of policy changes around exports and delays around LNG supply projects may slow any upward price move. Goldman Sachs analysts now expect natural gas to reach $4/MMBtu in 2026 instead of its previous timeline of the fourth quarter of 2025. Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But Jassy's messaging on an increased ratio of individual contributors to managers raises a much bigger question about organizational structure: What is the right balance between individual workers and managers in overall headcount? It's a question that corporations have long struggled to define with anything but anecdotal findings. With companies now firmly in a post-Covid world, organizational experts say Amazon may be leading the way in a new look at efficiency gains related to corporate bloat, and especially middle management bloat. "We have grown our teams quickly and substantially," said an Amazon spokesperson, echoing the message in Jassy's note: "When I think about my time at Amazon, I never imagined I'd be at the company for 27 years … Part of why I've stayed has been the unprecedented growth (we had $15M of annual revenue the year before I joined—this year should be well north of $600B)." That growth, the spokesperson said, inevitably led to adding a lot of managers. Comparing Amazon's plan to Meta's recent year of efficiency, the spokesperson said the company ended up adding more layers than it had before due to its growth and now is the right time to bring the structure "closer to our customers" and reinforce Amazon's "culture of ownership." Over the past few years, layoffs have been as prominent as hiring in the tech sector. In 2022-2023, the sector was in what could be called the years of the layoff. While that headcount trimming continues, the Amazon thinking involves a broader rethink of how to rightsize the largest corporations. Morgan Stanley analysts suggested that Amazon could cut as many as 14,000 management positions, with the corporate efficiencies accounting for $2 billion-$4 billion in savings. Morgan Stanley's forecast was based on an assumption that Jassy made in the note that Amazon is targeting an increase in the ratio of individual contributors to managers "by at least 15% by the end of 1Q25, across all divisions." Jassy pointed to "artifacts" of headcount growth, such as the "pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings," and has created a "Bureaucracy Mailbox" for employees to share processes that slow down decision-making and that he said "crept in and we can root out." This is not a process that is unique to Amazon, said Joseph Roh, professor at the Neeley School of Business at Texas Christian University. Rapid growth can lead to the rapid addition of "management layers without reassessing whether these roles are necessary," he said. In general, the flatter structure is in, and there is now greater emphasis on individual contributors across corporations. There is no exact formula, no "golden ratio" for contributor-to-manager. "My understanding is that the ideal ratio of individual contributors to managers depends largely on the nature of the work," Roh said, but he added that it is generally in the neighborhood of 7 to 10 individual contributors per manager. Investor and economic pressure play a role, and at a time when technology giants are spending billions on AI without being able to deliver to Wall Street immediate proof of the return on investment, a conscious effort to rein in other costs will be rewarded. And despite the fact that companies like Amazon want everyone back in the office, spit-balling ideas around the proverbial whiteboard or watercooler, there is a sense that AI already may be playing a role in a more direct way, with some middle management positions redundant. "Digital transformation plays a significant role," Roh said, "as automation and advanced technologies reduce the need for middle managers to oversee tasks that can now be monitored by software." "What you saw from Amazon is just the beginning," said Naeem Zafar, a professor at UC Berkeley Haas School of Business and Northeastern University, with the downsizing of the managerial layer a larger trend set to play out across corporate America. Technology companies that have dominated the economy and grown rapidly are leading the way, preaching the return to an approach of being nimble and innovative, but Zafar said there are also cultural factors at work. "The new generation of employees are different and work differently," he said, citing growing use of communication tools and a general work culture ethos that privileges freedom and balks at micro-management. According to Roh, organizations are adapting to the preferences of a younger workforce that "values less hierarchy and more autonomy in their roles." Zafar said the rise of AI alongside a new generation of workers reinforces this evolving view of managers. "Amazon's slashing of manager roles isn't just about cost-cutting; it's a glimpse into the future of work. Technology is eating away at the traditional corporate ladder, and middle management is feeling the bite," Zafar said. For decades, managers have been seen as "the glue holding companies together" and a key to translating strategy into action. But today, Zafar said, "AI-powered tools can analyze data, assign tasks, and track performance with unprecedented efficiency." That makes it inevitable that the question will arise, "Why pay for a middleman when a machine can do it better?" he added. Roh said Amazon's growth may make it an extreme example, but it is perhaps also a leading indicator. "Amazon's rebalancing reflects a broader corporate trend toward leaner, more efficient organizational structures, driven by the need for cost control, innovation, and competitiveness in rapidly evolving markets," he said. From health care to finance, companies are realizing that flatter hierarchies mean faster decisions and potentially bigger profits. As with any effort to improve efficiency and the bottom line, there are risks in an era of corporate flattening. Sacrificing employee well-being and the crucial human elements of leadership and innovation are challenges that will be at the center of this reshuffling in corporate America, Zafar said. But he added, "The future belongs to companies that can build lean, agile structures, empowering employees to thrive in a world where machines do the heavy lifting." Got a confidential news tip?

Title: The final Fed meeting of 2024 awaits: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The stock market rally has stalled as the final Federal Reserve meeting of the year approaches. In the past week, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was the only of the three major indexes to post a weekly gain, closing up more than 0.3%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.6%, while a decline in healthcare stocks weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which slid nearly 2%. The Dow has now fallen for seven straight sessions, its worst stretch since February 2020. Investors are set to receive a jam-packed week of economic news, highlighted by the Fed's next interest rate decision on Dec. 18. Markets widely expect the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, and investors are likely to focus on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell says about the path forward in 2025 during his press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Updates on November retail sales, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index — the Fed's preferred inflation gauge — and activity in the services and manufacturing sectors are also on the economic calendar. In corporate news, quarterly results from Micron (MU), Nike (NKE), FedEx (FDX) and Carnival Corporation (CCL) are expected. Entering Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting, markets are pricing in a roughly 97% chance the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by 25 basis points, per the CME FedWatch tool. But given recent data that showed the US economy is growing at a solid pace, the labor market isn't rapidly cooling, and inflation's path to the Fed's 2% goal is proving bumpy, many expect the Fed will cut rates by less than initially thought in 2025. Key to watch is the Fed's latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). That includes its "dot plot," which maps out policymakers' expectations for where interest rates could be headed in the future, as well as commentary from Powell during his press conference. Read more: What experts say about the possibility of additional rate cuts When the Fed last issued its dot plot in September, the median forecast was for the fed funds rate to end 2025 in a range of 3.25% to 3.5%. Instead of the four rate cuts in 2024 projected back in September, markets are pricing in just two rate cuts for next year, per Bloomberg data. "We think that the economic forecasts will show better growth and firmer inflation this year and that the median interest rate forecast dots will be revised to show three cuts next year instead of four, as in the September dots," JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note to clients. Bank of America US economist Aditya Bhave wrote in a note to clients that Powell is likely to point to a "slower pace" of cuts during his press conference including a pause in the rate-cutting cycle in January. Prior to the Fed's decision on Wednesday, officials will get a fresh reading on the state of the consumer with the November retail sales report. Economists estimate retail sales increased 0.5% over the prior month during October. The control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into the gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.4%. Bank of America's US economics team thinks this report will reflect a strong start to the holiday shopping period. "Online retail spending was particularly strong around the Thanksgiving period," the team wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "In fact, holiday spending is running ahead of cumulative 2023 levels despite a delayed Thanksgiving. Hence, we expect a robust retail sales report for Nov, with retail sales ex-autos and the core control category coming in at 0.5% m/m." Last week, readings of both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) showed signs of inflation making little progress toward the Fed's 2% target. But many economists argued that there were promising signs within the details of those reports that should lead to a less concerning reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge next Friday. Economists expect annual "core" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.9% in November, up from the 2.8% seen in October. But over the prior month, economists project "core" PCE at 0.2%, lower than the 0.3% increase seen in October. "In our view, November data on inflation should provide comfort that the disinflation process remains in place," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "Although headline and core CPI came in slightly above our expectation ... we found the details of the report favorable for thinking inflation would continue to move lower in the near-term." For 10 straight trading days more stocks have declined than risen in the S&P 500, the longest such stretch since September 2001. Still, over that time period which spans all of December thus far, the S&P 500 is up about 0.3%. Meanwhile, the equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 (^SPXEW), which isn't overly influenced by movements in large stocks within the index, is down more than 3%. "Savvy traders should at least pay attention to some of the warning signs about the overall health of the market. So far, it is the sniffles or just a case of bad breadth," Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. "But there are some symptoms that can lead to something more meaningful if left unattended." To Sosnick's point, for now, a rally in the largest tech stocks in the market is keeping the benchmark index afloat. On Wednesday the Nasdaq Composite closed above 20,000 for the first time ever as Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) all surged to record highs Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon told Yahoo Finance that this market action comes as investors have been digesting sticky inflation prints, and the possibility of the Fed cutting interest rates less than initially, though next year isn't a "surprise." "If rates are going to stay a little bit more elevated for a little bit longer than the consensus expected, then companies who have a net benefit from higher rates probably do well in that scenario," Gordon said while noting that the "Magnificent Seven" stocks fit that description.

Title: Will Sticky Inflation Stop The Fed Rate Cut?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/12/15/will-sticky-inflation-stop-the-fed-rate-cut/
Time Published: 2024-12-15T12:00:00Z

Inflation has remained sticky, raising fear that the Federal Reserve could be prevented from further ... [+] interest rate cuts. For example, meat and egg prices are 3.8% higher year-over-year, while auto insurance has risen a whopping 12.7%. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday, and last week’s hotter inflation data made the rate cut decision a bit more complicated. Meanwhile, economic data remains resilient, with the most recent estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth from the Atlanta Federal Reserve at 3.3%. Consumer inflation (CPI) ticked up to 2.7% year-over-year from 2.6% in October, consistent with expectations. Producer inflation (PPI) was above consensus at 3.0%, up from 2.6% previously. In both cases, inflation has remained sticky and above the 2% level. U.S. Consumer & Producer Inflation Recent headline CPI readings have been accelerating, with the three-month annualized rate running at 2.8%, likely making some Fed voters nervous about a resurgence in inflation. U.S. Consumer Inflation: CPI The recent upward trend in inflation has also affected core CPI, excluding food and energy. Annualizing the last 3 months, the core CPI ran at a hot 3.7%. U.S. Consumer Inflation: Core CPI Though it will be released after the Fed's decision, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the core PCE price index, should be at 2.9% year-over-year for November, which is well above the 2% target rate. While some other components of inflation might be stickier than expected, the Fed should be very confident that the rate of housing inflation should continue to moderate. Like Zillow, real-time measures of rent inflation point to downward pressure on the government’s lagging measure of rent inflation. Shelter inflation is 36.6% of the CPI measurement, which is meaningful. CPI & Rent Inflation While the last payroll report was solid on the surface, there were some cracks, such as the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Before the decline from the August unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Notably, another slight move upward in the unemployment rate will push the Sahm Rule back onto forecasting an economic downturn. Fed members are likely to focus on the softening of the labor market as a downside risk to the economy. The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits are above early-year levels, illustrating the rising risk to the employment outlook. Initial Jobless Claims The Federal Reserve began this easing cycle because monetary policy was too tight for the economic conditions. Looking at the real (after-inflation) level of the Federal Funds rate, monetary policy remains restrictive. This situation will likely convince Fed participants to vote for a rate cut as insurance against the downside economic risks at the Wednesday meeting. After-Inflation Federal Funds Rate Despite the sticky inflation data, futures pricing agrees with the analysis with over 90% odds of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the Fed meeting this week. The most significant change has been a reduction in the pace of rate cuts in 2025. The elevated inflation readings and resilient economy point to the Fed pausing rate cuts at the January 29th meeting to await more evidence of economic trends. While the rate cut on Wednesday won’t surprise markets, the Fed will update their forecasts. Those forecasts and Chair Powell’s comments will be parsed closely to judge the future pace of easing monetary policy but should include increased inflation and economic growth estimates.

The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), continued to move higher. The returns on the Magnificent 7 and bank stocks have been stellar since the U.S. Presidential election. Tesla (TSLA) has stood out since the election, rising almost 74%! Stock Market Performance This week will be full of economic releases ahead of the slower Christmas holiday week. Retail sales on Tuesday will be particularly crucial in judging the resilience of the consumer, but the main event will likely be Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting. Despite inflation remaining stickier than many would like, the Fed will almost surely cut short-term interest rates again. Stocks are in the midst of the most favorable time of the year, so the seasonals add some comfort that last week’s decline shouldn’t prove to be the start of a significant decline.

U.S. Consumer Inflation: Core CPI Though it will be released after the Fed's decision, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the core PCE price index, should be at 2.9% year-over-year for November, which is well above the 2% target rate.

Time Published: 2024-12-15T11:33:12Z

UPDATED 06:33 EST / DECEMBER 15 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market.

Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / DECEMBER 15 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis.

The Christmas holiday is fast approaching, and the festive spirit is in full swing as people gear up for celebrations, shopping sprees, and family reunions. While only a few companies are set to release earnings reports this week, the stock market is bracing for a potentially pivotal moment. This week, the Federal Reserve is expected to announce whether it will lower interest rates—a decision that could significantly influence the economic and financial landscape heading into 2025. With this critical development on the horizon, let’s explore what lies ahead in the world of the stock market this week. This week will be relatively lighter for earnings reports. Among the key highlights, Micron Technology (MU+1.68%) is set to announce its quarterly results on Wednesday after the closing bell. On Thursday, Accenture (ACN-0.04%) will unveil its financial performance before the opening bell. Later that day, both Nike (NKE+0.95%) and FedEx (FDX+1.26%) will take the spotlight, with their earnings reports scheduled for release after the market wraps up. The week ahead is packed with critical macroeconomic data releases, beginning Tuesday with the U.S. retail sales report for November, which will provide insights into consumer spending trends. Additionally, the Home Builder Confidence Index for December will be unveiled, shedding light on the outlook for the housing market. Wednesday takes center stage as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces its highly anticipated decision on interest rates. The CME Group’s FedWatch tool, which measures market expectations for Fed fund rate changes, expects a 25-basis-point rate cut. Following the decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will speak on the economic outlook and monetary policy trajectory. Thursday will feature the release of the weekly initial jobless claims data, and along with that, the latest figures on existing home sales will be posted. The week concludes on Friday with the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, a key measure of inflation tracking changes in consumer spending on goods and services. Additionally, the consumer sentiment report for December will be unveiled. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: 5 big analyst AI moves: Nvida’s next stop is $160-170; AMD, Adobe downgraded

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Jordan Klein, a tech desk sector strategist at Mizuho (NYSE:MFG) maintains a positive outlook for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), expecting the company’s management to deliver a highly optimistic perspective during investor sessions at the CES conference in early January. Mizuho projects NVIDIA's stock could climb to the $160-$170 range ahead of the GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in March, where the company is set to unveil its new product, Rubin. "All agree that NVDA sets up well to go on another run to new all-time highs in Q125 into Feb earnings date and GTC in March,” Klein wrote. “View is that NVDA mgmt. will reinforce a very bullish view at investor meetings during CES in early Jan. I get sense some think Next (LON:NXT) stop NVDA is $160-170 level into GTC and the big preview of Rubin. I can feel the NVDA – AMD pair trade being sized up already," he added. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analysts reaffirmed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as their top pick for 2025, highlighting three key catalysts supporting their optimistic outlook. The first driver is the potential impact of Apple Intelligence, the company’s AI initiative, on iPhone replacement cycles. While current iPhone demand remains muted, Morgan Stanley sees broader availability of Apple Intelligence in fiscal 2025 sparking a surge in demand. The firm forecasts iPhone shipments to grow 12% year-over-year to 258 million units in fiscal 2026, fueled by features such as enhanced Siri, AI image tools, and ChatGPT integration. “A relatively moderate replacement cycle contraction of just 0.3 years off an all-time replacement cycle high of ~5 years” is expected, according to analysts led by Erik W. Woodring. The second catalyst is sustained double-digit growth in Apple’s services segment, underpinned by pricing power, broader adoption, and new offerings. Morgan Stanley projects an 11.4% compound annual growth rate in services revenue through fiscal 2027, exceeding consensus expectations. The report highlights that less than half of Apple’s user base currently subscribes to services. Combined with mid-single-digit annual growth in the installed base and pricing adjustments, annual services growth could gain an additional six percentage points. Finally, Morgan Stanley anticipates steady gross margin expansion over the next three years, driven by a favorable revenue mix, cost efficiencies, and the faster growth of services revenue. While memory costs have risen, the analysts highlight “an emerging cyclical tailwind in 2025” as memory prices stabilize. They estimate annual gross margin growth of 50 basis points through fiscal 2027. Meanwhile, Mizuho raised its price target for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to $260 from $240, highlighting the growing potential of generative AI (GenAI) applications as a key growth driver. The firm pointed to innovations showcased at the AWS re:Invent 2024 conference, which aim to overcome barriers in deploying GenAI solutions and pave the way for significant growth in fiscal 2025. According to Mizuho, AWS’s efforts are centered on three areas: cost reduction, simplified application development, and advanced AI-agent functionalities. AWS’s new Trainium2 chip, which reduces capacity costs by 40%, is expected to provide a cost-effective solution for scaling GenAI. Mizuho also emphasized the Bedrock platform’s ability to streamline coding, data integration, and model selection, enabling faster application development. Further, AWS is advancing AI-agent workflows in areas like loan underwriting, using foundational models with enhanced reasoning and context processing capabilities. These developments are expected to drive GenAI adoption across industries. "With use-cases moving into production, we expect inferencing volume should accelerate through application development and usage in FY25, affirming our thesis of Gen-AI's consumption multiplier effect," Mizuho wrote. In turn, the firm has increased its FY25 AWS revenue growth forecast to 21%, up from 19%. Earlier this week, Bank of America downgraded Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock to Neutral from Buy, citing risks to its 2025 outlook. The firm also cut its price target for AMD to $155 from $180 and reduced its 2025/26 earnings per share (EPS) projections by 6% and 8%, noting a 13-23% gap compared to consensus estimates. Two key factors underpin BofA’s cautious view. The first is competitive pressure in the AI market, particularly from NVIDIA and custom chipmakers like Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which could constrain AMD’s market share growth. “Recently largest cloud customer, Amazon strongly indicated its preference for alternative custom (Trainium/ MRVL) and NVDA products, but a lack of strong demand for AMD,” adding that other major cloud providers, such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), show similar preferences. BofA estimates AMD will hold just 4% of the $200 billion AI accelerator market in 2025, a sharp contrast to NVIDIA’s dominant 80%+ share. The second concern is a potential slowdown in the PC processor market in early 2025. After a robust 40% half-on-half increase in AMD’s client PC sales in late 2024, BofA expects the market could soften, putting pressure on the company’s growth trajectory. On the other hand, BofA acknowledged AMD’s strong execution and ability to benefit from Intel’s restructuring, which could open doors for greater market share in PC and server CPUs. The report also highlighted AMD’s solid relationships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) as positives but noted limited opportunities for the company to exceed Street expectations in the AI segment. Following weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, TD Cowen downgraded Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) from Buy to Hold and lowered its price target from $625 to $550. The firm highlighted several challenges that could weigh on Adobe's growth prospects, including a slowdown in growth trends and potential disruptions related to changes in its go-to-market (GTM) strategy. Adobe reported fourth-quarter net new annualized recurring revenue (ARR) of $578 million, representing a 2% year-over-year increase. While this exceeded guidance by about 5%, it fell short of the average beat over the trailing twelve months. For fiscal 2025, Adobe’s growth guidance of 8-10%—including a 50-75 basis points headwind from foreign exchange—came in below the Street’s expectation of 11%. Moreover, management forecasts a 50 basis points decline in operating margin, contrary to the flat margin projected by analysts. ARR growth is also expected to slow, decelerating from 13% to 11%. TD Cowen also notes that Adobe is prioritizing the adoption of AI technologies over immediate monetization. While some AI-driven initiatives, such as GenStudio for enterprises and the AI Assistant in Acrobat, are gaining traction, they currently represent a small portion of revenue. Looking ahead, analysts see multiple headwinds for Adobe in 2025. These include the waning of pricing tailwinds in the first half of the year, potential disruptions from GTM changes in the first quarter, and indications of weaker growth trends based on partner checks.

U.Today - Chinese cryptocurrency journalist and blogger Colin Wu spreads the word about the positive Bitcoin-related changes that are taking place in Thailand now. Besides, the former price minister of the country Thaksin Shinawatra has made an ultra-bullish Bitcoin price prediction. He also believes that it is important to raise Bitcoin awareness among the population. Therefore, an order has been issued to set up a sandbox that would allow BTC to be used for payments in Phuket. This initiative came up after the outcome of the recent presidential elections in the U.S. and the expected pivot in cryptocurrency policies in the country in the near future. Some politicians in Thailand believe that the U.S. may use Bitcoin to repay its national debt or part of it to creditors. Besides, Thailand may start deep research and study of stablecoins. The goal is to find out whether it is possible to invest money in the economy without printing more banknotes by issuing coins backed by government bonds. If this is done, Thaksin Shinawatra reckons that the country’s economy will definitely show impressive growth. The Nasdaq 100 index also includes such tech giants as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). MicroStrategy’s market capitalization boost (the key requirement for a company to be added to Nasdaq) has been down its Bitcoin strategy since 2020, when the company started its regular bets on BTC. As of December 2024, Saylor’s company holds 423,650 Bitcoin roughly worth $41.5 billion. Over the past couple of years, MicroStrategy has been issuing senior convertible bonds to raise billions of U.S. dollars to make large new Bitcoin acquisitions.

Billionaire Warren Buffett is now betting a whopping $120 billion on just two assets. The chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has allocated 40.1% of the firm’s portfolio to Apple (AAPL) and American Express (AXP), according to new SEC filings. Berkshire initiated its investment in Apple back in 2016 and has adjusted its holdings multiple times, including significant reductions this year. And the firm’s steady exposure to American Express comes despite a years-long departure from the US banking sector and a multi billion-dollar exodus from positions in Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Buffett has held American Express stock since the mid 90’s and has said he’ll never sell it, touting its strong brand, loyal customer base, wide economic moat and consistent profitability. As Buffett continues to sell Bank of America shares, BAC now sits in the number three position in Berkshire’s portfolio, with about $35 billion invested, representing 11.7% of the portfolio. Overall, Buffett continues to exercise caution in the markets, with Berkshire now sitting on $325 billion in cash and equivalents, nearly double the amount at the end of 2023. Berkshire has about $300 billion invested – here’s a look at the firm’s top 10 positions at time of publishing.

Title: Media Insider: Omnicom and IPG – advertising’s global mega-merger and the impact on the New Zealand industry and clients

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The work of Kiwi creatives in global advertising firms has been world-class, including campaigns such as 'Ghost Chips', 'Driving Dogs' and 'Togs, Undies'. New Zealand’s advertising industry is in for a shake-up – amid fears of staff cutbacks, concerns about client conflicts, and broader market impacts – as two of the world’s biggest agencies merge to form a global behemoth. Omnicom’s (OMG) planned US$13 billion acquisition of IPG – announced in the US this week – is a seismic shift that will reverberate around the world, including in New Zealand, where major OMG brands such as PHD, OMD, Colenso, DDB, Clemenger, TBWA, Hearts & Science and Dynamo will be now housed under the same umbrella as IPG agencies such as FCB and Initiative. The OMG-IPG giant will become the world’s biggest advertising holding company, surpassing Publicis and WPP. The move and its market impacts are likely to be carefully monitored by the anti-competitive watchdog Commerce Commission as well as smaller, New Zealand-owned independent agencies and the broader industry. Sources say OMG agencies already lay claim to more than 50% of media spend in New Zealand; the new mega-merger will only reinforce that dominance. “As a result, OMG will command significant buying power which may place pressure on both media owners, who will likely be pushed to deliver the best price and value to OMG clients, and independent agencies, who may struggle to compete with these pressures,” said one source. “Managing conflict will be OMG’s main priority as clients may have concerns at how their businesses will be managed. At an initial glance, a newly consolidated OMG would have the three main telco clients (Spark, One NZ and 2degrees), almost all of the major banks and various other clashing clients.” But while big might seem beautiful, there will be plenty of nervous staff in the various agencies. “Behind the celebratory headlines and executive statements lies a stark reality for employees at Omnicom and IPG,” reported CEO Today. “The announcement’s promise of $750 million ($NZ1.3 billion) in cost synergies has sparked fears of widespread layoffs, particularly among overlapping functions and agencies.” One advertising analyst told the website: “Consolidation is the name of the game right now. This merger sets a new benchmark and signals that scale is no longer optional in an industry dominated by big tech platforms like Google and Amazon.” New Zealand sources believe it will still take some time for big changes, such as cutbacks, to filter to the local market. Even so, there would be broader market impacts. “The concentration of market power is quite a significant issue,” said one source. “You could ostensibly have DDB, FCB, Colenso and Clemenger all pitching for the same Government account, for instance. This might create the impression of different companies, but all essentially feed into the same mothership. From a procurement perspective, this could pose an interesting ethical dilemma for government departments. “How comfortable should a government department feel knowing that all those businesses are owned by the same organisation?” Client clashes and conflicts within agencies were also flagged as an industry concern. “Ad agencies have always been pretty good at managing this,” said one source. “It wasn’t that long ago that DDB had Westpac, Colenso BBDO had BNZ and TBWA had ANZ, despite all these agencies being owned by Omnicom. We’re going to see much more of that happening as even more brands are brought under the same umbrella. It now becomes a question of how comfortable clients feel about this – especially in the event that we do see some consolidation.” Independent Media Agencies of New Zealand (IMANZ) general manager Kath Mitchell said her members were resilient, quoting latest industry data showing 49% had expanded in the past 12 months and a further 28% had been stable. “However, we need to consider how far that resilience can stretch. Mergers like this mean we will see a concentration of greater market power in a single holding company. We should, at the very least, be having conversations about what impact that has.” She said data also showed 45% of IMANZ members did not have a single government client. “I would hope that the news of this merger helps to draw attention to how the industry is structured and how much power is concentrated in a small group of holding companies. “My advice to those who work in government procurement is to look deeper at agency ownership and often they will find they feed into one of those holding companies sending their profits offshore.” A Commerce Commission spokeswoman said the organisation had not received any material at this stage about the proposed global transaction, “but we are aware of it”. “We assess mergers using the substantial lessening of competition test. This test asks whether a merger is likely to substantially lessen competition by comparing the likely state of competition if the merger proceeds with the likely state of competition if the merger does not proceed. “We will give clearance to a proposed merger if we are satisfied that the merger is unlikely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a New Zealand market.” Omnicom chief executive John Wren said in a statement that the acquisition of Interpublic would “harness the significant opportunities created by new technologies in this era of exponential change.” The deal is expected to be in place by the second half of next year. It perhaps seems questionable whether New York executives will be too bothered about seeking permission in this part of the world. The Commerce Commission spokeswoman acknowledged that filing for a merger clearance in New Zealand was voluntary. “The commission cannot require parties to file for clearance,” she said. “However, if parties do not file for clearance, and the commission forms the view that their transaction may have or may have had, the effect of substantially lessening competition, the commission can open an investigation into the transaction and ultimately take enforcement action which could result in significant penalties or a court reversing the transaction.” “It’s important to understand that the impact of this flows through to some of the best ad agency brands in this country,” says former NZ Herald advertising and marketing columnist Damien Venuto, now a senior account director at One Plus One. “If you look at the likes of DDB, FCB, TBWA, Colenso BBDO and Clemenger, you’re talking about the companies that have given us some of the most loved ads in the history of New Zealand. “Driving Dogs, the Lotto Pirate Ship, Togs-Undies and Ghost Chips are just some of the campaigns to have emerged from these brands. What you’re talking about here is talent and cultural history in our creative sector.” The deal meant that all profits that flowed through these companies would ultimately end up in the newly merged US-listed entity. “This, of course, isn’t new,” said Venuto. “As long as there have been holding companies, advertising money spent in New Zealand has flowed through to those global juggernauts. The difference now is that we have one less holding company competing for a cut of an even more consolidated pie. “I expect independent agencies, which New Zealand has in abundance, will look for ways to capitalise on this opportunity and play up their point of difference.” Mitchell said: “While our independent media agencies cannot compete with the scale of global holding companies, we bring agility, adaptability and innovation to the table to create bespoke strategies for clients. She said independent media agencies were able to implement innovative strategies that larger firms might be slower to adopt. The independents could “push creative boundaries without corporate constraints”, she said. Furthermore, independent media agencies were willing and prepared to collaborate with the global agencies when it made commercial sense for all parties involved, especially the client. “When you invest in a local independent media agency, you know every cent of that is staying in New Zealand. IMANZ members processed an estimated $570 million in annual billings last year and employ over 760 employees across the country – there’s a great opportunity for local to support local.” Meanwhile, Omnicom and some of their agency executives in this part of the world are not keen to comment at this stage. “Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide any commentary at this moment. Thank you for your understanding,” said OMG APAC chief communications and talent experience officer Justin Low.

Title: Klarna's CEO says it stopped hiring thanks to AI but still advertises many open positions | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski recently told Bloomberg TV that his company essentially stopped hiring a year ago and credited generative AI for enabling this massive workforce reduction. However, despite Siemiatkowski’s bullishness on AI, the company is not relying entirely on AI to replace human workers who leave, as open job listings — for more humans — and the company’s own statements confirm. “We stopped hiring about a year ago. We were 4,500, now we’re 3,500,” Siemiatkowski told Bloomberg TV. “We have a natural attrition, as [does] every tech company. People stay about 5 years — so 20% leave every year — and by not hiring, we’re simply shrinking.” The company’s CEO also said he believes AI can effectively replace workers. “I am of the opinion that AI can already do all of the jobs that we as humans do,” said Siemiatkowski. “We’re gonna give some of the improvements [from] the efficiency that AI provides by increasing the pace at which the salaries of our employees increases.” Siemiatkowski often makes this variety of comments. To start 2024, the Klarna CEO said ChatGPT was doing the work of 700 human employees. At another point, he said that Klarna was dropping Salesforce as a CRM provider and replacing it with AI, a comment Marc Benioff expressed skepticism about. Just this week, the Klarna CEO made an AI deepfake of himself to report his financial results, attempting to prove that even a CEO can be replaced by AI. But in practice, while Klarna has significantly reduced its workforce in the last year, the buy now, pay later company has not completely stopped hiring. Klarna is currently hiring for more than 50 roles around the globe, according to the job postings page on its website. Furthermore, Klarna’s managers have said they are actively hiring or growing their teams at least half a dozen times throughout 2024, according to posts on LinkedIn viewed by TechCrunch. Klarna also hired several new employees in the last year to fill roles on its policy, software engineering, and global partnerships teams, according to LinkedIn posts from recently hired Klarna employees. Klarna’s global press lead, John Craske, tells TechCrunch that Siemiatkowski’s comments about hiring are directionally true but says the CEO was “simplifying for brevity in a broadcast interview.” “When you look at it historically, we were hiring between one to one and a half thousand people a year from 2019 to 2022,” said Craske in an email. “Now, we’re not actively recruiting to expand the workforce but only backfilling some essential roles, predominantly engineering.” In other words, not every job can be replaced with AI today. While AI may be helping Klarna do more work with fewer people, it’s worth noting that Klarna has the same number of employees today as it did in 2021. Like most tech companies, Klarna was hiring a lot during the pandemic. Many companies, including Meta and Amazon, have reduced their workforces in the last few years, either by slowing down hiring or having layoffs. It’s also worth pointing out that Klarna is looking to IPO soon. Siemiatkowski could be trying to convince investors that his company is aggressively incorporating generative AI into its workflows and that the benefits are already showing up. But for most companies these days, AI adoption and implementation are happening at a much slower rate.

Investing.com -- As the second week of December ended, several stocks experienced significant volatility, mostly as a reaction to their earnings results. Out of many, here are Investing.com’s stocks of the week: Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) experienced a sharp decline after reporting disappointing guidance on Thursday, leading several analysts, including those from RBC Capital, Mizuho (NYSE:MFG), Piper Sandler, and Oppenheimer, to lower their price targets to a range of $590–$620. RBC Capital cut its price target to $590 from $610, citing reduced estimates but maintained an Outperform rating. The firm noted that Adobe’s quarterly results were solid, with record DM net-new ARR, although the upside was smaller compared to recent quarters. "ADBE has been a frustrating stock for much of FY24. Having said that, we remain confident ADBE will significantly monetize its Generative AI innovations going forward, and we expect healthy upside to the FY25 ARR/revenue guidance as the year unfolds.," an analyst at Mizuho said. On Friday, Adobe’s stock continued to decline, trading about 2% lower at $465. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock saw positive reaction after its earnings, buoyed by upbeat guidance and surging AI revenues. The company hit a trillion-dollar valuation on Friday and shares climbed over 24%. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed its Overweight rating and a $250 price target for the stock. “We see the strength in AI continuing at a rapid pace for AVGO, and the company has laid out a SAM of $60B–$90B with its three AI customers that it currently does business with,” an analyst at Piper Sandler noted. This week, Warner Bros Discovery Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) announced its new corporate structure, under which Warner Bros. Discovery will serve as the parent company for two distinct operating divisions - Global Linear Networks and Streaming & Studios. "We continue to prioritize ensuring our Global Linear Networks business is well positioned to continue to drive free cash flow, while our Streaming & Studios business focuses on driving growth by telling the world’s most compelling stories," according to the firm's President and CEO, David Zaslav. The company expects to complete the implementation of the new corporate structure by mid-2025. The new structure is expected to give it more flexibility. Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google kicked off the week by unveiling a new chip called Willow, which demonstrates advanced error correction and performance capabilities, paving the way for a functional, large-scale quantum computer. The tech giant also unveiled Gemini 2.0, its latest AI model, which Google claims is its most advanced yet. Even though shares rose during the week following these announcements, Alphabet shares ended the week down by 1.11%. Separately, The Information reported on Thursday that Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai was expected to meet with President-elect Donald Trump.

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. OpenAI made canvas, an interface to “collaborate” with ChatGPT on writing and coding projects, available to all web and Windows desktop users this week. The feature was made available in beta to ChatGPT Plus and Team users in October. Now out of beta, canvas is built directly into OpenAI’s GPT-4o model, so it doesn’t need to be selected separately in ChatGPT’s model picker. Other new features include running Python code directly in canvas for improvement suggestions and bug fixes, and compatibility with custom-made GPTs. Cohere released Command R7B — the smallest, fastest, and last model in its R series of large language models (LLMs) for the enterprise — this week. Due to its compact size, the model can be served on low-end graphics processing units (GPUs), core processing units (CPUs), and a MacBook to accelerate production of AI applications. In its class of open-weights models, Command R7B delivers state-of-the-art performance in real-world tasks such as reasoning and agentic behavior, according to the startup. “The model is designed for developers and businesses that need to optimize for the speed, cost-performance, and compute resources of their use cases,” Cohere said. Command R7B is available on the Cohere Platform and on HuggingFace. Speak, a language learning AI startup, announced a $78 million Series C funding round this week. The deal, which values the company at $1 billion, was led by Accel, and included existing investors such as OpenAI Startup Fund and Khosla Ventures. The Series C marks the AI language tutor’s second raise this year, and has doubled the startup’s valuation in six months. “We’ve engineered a breakthrough in spoken fluency by combining our proprietary learning method with advanced AI that adapts to each user’s needs, making true fluency accessible to so many more people,” Connor Zwick, chief executive and co-founder of Speak, said in a statement. “So far this year, users have already spoken more than one billion sentences with Speak.” Zwick said Speak plans to expand to more countries in 2025. Ayar Labs, a startup that developed the first in-package optical I/O solution to replace electrical I/O in AI training and inferencing chips, announced a $155 million Series D funding round this week. The deal was led by Advent Global Opportunities and Light Street Capital, and included investments from AMD Ventures (AMD), Intel Capital (INTC), and Nvidia (NVDA). Ayar Labs is now valued at more than $1 billion. The startup is changing the way data moves between chips with its I/O technology, which it says can “eliminate bottlenecks created by traditional copper interconnects and pluggable optics.” The funding will allow Ayar Labs to scale its technology, which “allows customers to maximize the compute efficiency and performance of their AI infrastructure, while reducing costs and power consumption, to dramatically improve profitability metrics for AI applications.” “The leading GPU providers — AMD and NVIDIA — and semiconductor foundries — GlobalFoundries (GFS), Intel Foundry, and TSMC (TSM) — combined with the backing of Advent, Light Street, and our other investors underscores the potential of our optical I/O technology to redefine the future of AI infrastructure,” Mark Wade, chief executive and co-founder of Ayar Labs, said in a statement. “We are incredibly fortunate to have the backing of Light Street’s deep expertise in technology-specific investments as well as Advent’s robust private and growth equity background in this funding round.” Gentrace, a developer platform that allows entire product teams to collaborate on AI testing and monitoring, announced an $8 million Series A funding round this week. The funding round was led by Matrix Partners, and brings the startup’s total funding to $14 million. With the Gentrace platform, product managers, subject matter experts, designers, and quality assurance can all collaborate on evaluating AI model performance with engineering teams. The startup also launched Experiments, a tool enabling collaborative large language model (LLM) testing. The tool allows teams to preview test outcomes before deploying models and anticipate errors, among other features. “Generative AI represents a paradigm shift in software development, but the reality is there’s way too much noise and not enough signal on how to test and build them easily or correctly,” Doug Safreno, co-founder and chief executive of Gentrace, said in a statement. “We’re not just creating another dev tool — we’re reimagining how entire organizations can collaborate and build better LLM products.” Crusoe, a vertically integrated AI infrastructure provider, announced a $600 million Series D funding round this week. The deal was led by Founders Fund and included Nvidia as an investor. The startup provides cost-effective and “environmentally aligned” AI infrastructure by harnessing large-scale clean energy. Crusoe also builds AI-optimized data centers and has a development platform. “We believe a new approach is needed to power the AI revolution,” Chase Lochmiller, chief executive and co-founder of Crusoe, said in a statement. “To reduce complexity, accelerate time-to-value, and support the most demanding AI solutions, customers need a vertically integrated approach. We are able to innovate faster and bring new, state-of-the-art capacity online in a fraction of the time compared to legacy cloud providers while delivering unmatched results for customers, making the promises of AI a reality.” Crusoe also announced its Crusoe Cloud platform is generally available for AI and machine learning workloads.

Title: Michael Saylor’s Relentless Focus on Bitcoin Lands His Firm in the Nasdaq-100 Index

On December 13, the Nasdaq stock exchange, founded in 1971, which pioneered the concept of electronic trading and which hosts many of the world’s leading tech firms, announced that on December 23, MicroStrategy Inc., which is one of the companies listed on the exchange, would get added to the Nasdaq-100 Index, which is a stock market index launched in January 1985 that tracks the performance of the 100 largest (by market capitalization) non-financial firms listed on the Nasdaq exchange. It is worth pointing out that Nasdaq-100 and QQQ are not the same — the former is an index while the latter is an exchange-traded fund (ETF). QQQ, which is officially known as the Invesco QQQ Trust, is an ETF that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 index, providing investors with a way to get exposure to the firms in the Nasdaq-100 through a single investment product. Nasdaq also announced that two other firms would be joining MicroStrategy on Nasdaq-100: Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (Nasdaq: AXON). Although Nasdaq is best known for being the world’s premier exchange for tech firms, in reality it hosts firms from a diverse array of sectors. Another index launched at the same time as the Nasdaq-100 is the Nasdaq Financial-100 Index, which consists of the the 100 largest (by market cap) financial firms. The Nasdaq-100 is reconstituted annually in December, “timed to coincide with the quadruple witch expiration Friday of the quarter,” with the changes becoming effective just before the market opens, usually some date in mid-to-late December. Getting added to the Nasdaq-100 is a huge badge of honor for tech firms, and it is very hard to imagine MicroStrategy ending up there if it not had been for co-founder (and currently executive chairman) Michael Saylor and his strong belief in and advocacy for Bitcoin since the firm’s struggling software business is reporting increasingly lower revenue and increasingly higher losses based on the most recent financial results. For Q3 2024, the firm recorded a revenue of $116.1 million and a net loss of $340 million. So, how come MicroStrategy has a market cap of nearly $98 billion? Well, that all comes down to the decision — announced in August 2020, to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as a primary treasury reserve asset. This is also when it disclosed that it had bought 21,454 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $250 million. Under Saylor’s leadership and guidance, the firm has bet its future on Bitcoin and continuously kept accumulating Bitcoin. As of December 9, the firm owned 423,650 bitcoins (which has a current value of around $43 billion, which has been acquired for a total cost of around $25.6 billion, making it the largest corporate holder of BTC. MicroStrategy has acquired 21,550 BTC for ~$2.1 billion at ~$98,783 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 43.2% QTD and 68.7% YTD.

Title: Why more companies are looking to buy bitcoin
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-crypto-rally-microstrategy-microsoft-leverage-risks-inflation-btc-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-14T09:30:02Z

MicroStrategy's bet on bitcoin has fueled a wild rally in the shares of the business software company — and it's driving more companies to copy the strategy. MicroStrategy's crypto playbook has catapulted its stock up 501% this year. Though its core business is software, piling up an enormous trove of bitcoin has become its guiding star. Now, other firms are stocking up. Mimicking MicroStrategy's approach, corporate bitcoin adopters include the crypto firm Marathon Holdings and Japan's Metaplanet. Biopharma company Acurx Pharmaceuticals also recently announced the approval by its boar for a $1 million purchase. Though bitcoin holdings aren't unique to MicroStrategy, the move is generally rare for firms outside the crypto industry to invest. That could be changing, though, industry sources told Business Insider. "Speculative transactions, previously inherent in the crypto market, are becoming a thing of the past, and the ever-growing interest of institutions in creating reserves based on bitcoin confirms this," Gracy Chen, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, told BI. In a December note, Bernstein analysts suggested that bitcoin will replace gold as the world's premier "store of value" asset and become a standard holding in corporate treasuries. Chen noted that bitcoin has gained a reputation as a hedge against inflation and economic crises, which could be attractive to companies as the world grows more volatile. The argument is emerging more and more — recently, a think tank pushed for Microsoft to consider buying bitcoin for this reason, with a similar proposal being floated to Amazon shareholders. Of course, bitcoin's triple-digit rally this year also spurs dreams of hefty profit, with MicroStrategy's wild stock rally exhibit A. The firm has raked in tokens by selling interest-free convertible debt, which rewards the buyer if bitcoin keeps rising. The success of these has turbocharged its stock price. "At a bitcoin price of $97,400, the value of the bitcoins that the company has created this year is ~$7.7bn, and we believe it is important to note that it created that value without the capital outlays and operational costs associated with bitcoin mining," Benchmark Company managing director Mark Palmer wrote in November. But for firms trying to replicate this, caution is necessary here, Chen said. New entrants face a much steeper bitcoin price than when MicroStrategy started buying. Companies that buy bitcoin using leverage also expose themselves to heightened risks if bitcoin suddenly drops: while the crypto's price may erode, debt obligations do not. Though this same concern has crept up for MicroStrategy, Palmer told BI that the firm has survived previous sell-offs, and has diversified means of buying bitcoin. "If we were to see the price of bitcoin drop such that MicroStrategy was trading at a discount to its [net asset value], then it would be in a position to create shareholder value through share buybacks, and I think that's a big part of the flexibility the company has created," he said. Not all shareholders want to see companies jump on the crypto bandwagon. On Wednesday, Microsoft investors voted down the think tank proposal that pushed for the tech titan to buy bitcoin. Ahead of the decision, the board similarly recommended that shareholders reject the idea. This was expected, Chen said, as most Microsoft shareholders likely value the software giant's asset stability. "The company's investment in Bitcoin may mean additional risk in investing in MSFT, while many invested in MSFT as a predictable good business," she told BI, later adding: "For shareholders who build their own diversified portfolios, mixing assets like cryptocurrencies into corporate balance sheets can complicate the valuation of a company and distract from the core business objectives for which investors are buying its shares."

The agreement to acquire the three manufacturing sites was announced on 5 February 2024. For further information, please see the company announcement here. Novo Nordisk now expects the acquisition to be completed in the coming days. Upon completion, the acquisition is expected to impact the financial outlook as issued on 6 November 2024, with a low single-digit negative impact on operating profit growth and to negatively impact free cash flow with the 11.7 billion USD acquisition price. The ongoing share buyback programme of 20 billion DKK is not impacted. For 2025, the acquisition is expected to have a mid single-digit negative impact on operating profit growth. The acquisition will be mainly debt-financed, with interest payments negatively impacting net financial items. Novo Nordisk’s capital allocation priorities focus on internal growth investments, including supply chain expansions, dividends as well as external growth opportunities, including acquiring the three manufacturing sites. Consequently, Novo Nordisk is not expecting to initiate a share buyback programme in 2025. Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark. Our purpose is to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases, built upon our heritage in diabetes. We do so by pioneering scientific breakthroughs, expanding access to our medicines, and working to prevent and ultimately cure disease.

Share this article The Nasdaq-100 Index will welcome MicroStrategy, Palantir Technologies, and Axon Enterprise as new members before market open on December 23, as announced by Nasdaq during its annual reconstitution on Friday. The three companies will replace Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna in the annual reconstitution of the index, which comprises 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. With a market value of $102 billion as of December 13, MicroStrategy is set to rank 40th on the Nasdaq-100. Entering the Nasdaq-100, MicroStrategy stands to attract approximately $2.1 billion from ETFs that directly track the index, which collectively manage around $451 billion in assets, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reiterated in a post following Nasdaq’s announcement. He added that the $2.1 billion buying estimate might be conservative as it excludes separately managed accounts, closed-end funds, and active strategies. This weighting equates to about $2.1b of buying via all the ETFs that track the index which have $451b collectively. We did not include SMAs or CITs or any active strategies so it could be a little more when all is said and done. @JSeyff — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 14, 2024 This influx of capital is projected to drive up MicroStrategy’s stock price and enhance its market visibility. Stocks typically see a rise in price following their inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. Bernstein analysts project MicroStrategy shares could reach $600 following its inclusion in the index, driven by the anticipated capital inflow from index-tracking investment funds. MicroStrategy has established itself as a major player in the Bitcoin market through its giant holdings. The company’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 will likely accelerate its ambitious goal of accumulating $42 billion worth of Bitcoin over the next three years. As MicroStrategy’s stock price rises due to increased demand, the company will have greater financial flexibility to continue its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Michael Saylor-led company currently holds approximately 423,650 Bitcoin, valued at around $42 billion. The company has consistently expressed its intent to further increase its Bitcoin holdings, even at higher prices. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin investment makes its stock a proxy for Bitcoin. This means that owning MicroStrategy shares provides investors with indirect exposure to the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin was up slightly following Nasdaq’s announcement. It’s now trading above $102,000 million, reflecting a 2.5% increase in the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

The Nasdaq 100 comprises 100 of the largest nonfinancial companies in the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index. A stock's addition means that ETFs – including the highly popular Invesco QQQ Trust, which has $325 billion in assets – will become automatic buyers as well. Shares of the bitcoin proxy could be set to gain off the move. They're up more than sixfold this year, compared with bitcoin's nearly 140% gain in the same period. The change, which will become effective before the market open on Dec. 23, was announced Friday after the stock market close. MicroStrategy was widely telegraphed as a potential contender for membership by investors who were looking forward to the index's rebalancing this week. "This would lead to inclusion of MSTR in some of the largest ETFs such as QQQ (5th largest ETF) etc, leading to one-time fresh buying … and ongoing participation in future inflows," said Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Bernstein, in a note this week ahead of the reshuffle. Additionally, "the market will likely set its sight on S&P 500 inclusion for 2025," Chhugani said. "Currently, due to profitability of its software business, it may be challenging to be considered for S&P 500 inclusion." The Nasdaq changes the constitution of the Nasdaq 100 index annually. The companies selected for inclusion are based largely on market cap rankings on the last trading day of November, which was Nov. 29 this year. Stocks must also meet eligibility requirements around liquidity and the free float percentage of their shares. MicroStrategy originally sold enterprise software, but the firm has increasingly become a bitcoin holding company. It first added bitcoin to its balance sheet in 2020, with Michael Saylor as CEO at the time, and has been leaning into that strategy in the years since. MicroStrategy now issues convertible notes to leverage its purchases, and its stock's daily trading sometimes looks like a more volatile version of bitcoin. The company now has a market cap of roughly $90 billion despite having less than $500 million in revenue over its previous four quarters, according to FactSet. Saylor told CNBC's "Squawk Box" earlier this month that he sees the company's role as "securitizing bitcoin." "Primarily, our job is to bridge the traditional capital markets that want bonds, or they want fixed income, or they want equity, or they want options, and we plug that into the crypto economy. And we use bitcoin as the vehicle to do that," said Saylor, who is now the company's executive chairman. MicroStrategy began cranking up its purchases after the U.S. presidential election. The victory of pro-crypto President-elect Donald Trump — specifically his promise to establish a national strategic bitcoin stockpile — has propelled bitcoin to new all-time highs, achieved in part by the company's purchases. MicroStrategy now owns 423,650 bitcoins. It bought 149,880 of them in four different purchases over the past month, beginning Nov. 11. As part of MicroStrategy's hot streak this year, activists have been pushing bitcoin investing as an agenda item in shareholder meetings at companies like Microsoft and Amazon. Mining stocks like Mara Holdings have also begun employing Saylor's bitcoin yield strategy. Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise will also be joining the Nasdaq 100 later this month. Illumina, Moderna and Super Micro Computer will be removed from the index. Last year, the Nasdaq 100 added six companies in its annual reconstitution, including DoorDash. Five of those six stocks rose the Monday after the announcement, with an average move of 1.21%. —With reporting by Jesse Pound. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: MicroStrategy to Enter Nasdaq 100, Exposing Bitcoin-Linked Stock to Billions in Passive Investment Flows

MicroStrategy (MSTR) is set to soon be included in of the world's largest exchange-traded funds after becoming the first bitcoin-centric company to win entry into the Nasdaq-100 Index. The Nasdaq-100 Index tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange and is filled with dominant market names like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Costco. The price of bitcoin (BTC) added modestly to earlier gains, topping $102,000 in the minutes following the Friday 8 pm ET press release from Nasdaq announcing the inclusion. On Nov. 29, the day when the Nasdaq took a market snapshot in preparation for the index's annual rebalancing, MicroStrategy had a market cap of roughly $92 billion. That would rank the Michael Saylor-led company as the 40th largest in the Nasdaq 100 and a likely weighting in the index of 0.47%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. As comparison, Apple — prior to this year's rebalancing — had the index's largest weighting at just under 9%; Qualcomm had the 20th largest weighting at just above 1%. The addition will exponentially increase the Nasdaq 100's exposure to bitcoin (BTC), of which MicroStrategy owns about $42 billion worth, and expose MSTR to billions in passive investment. ETFs tracking the Nasdaq 100 have more than $550 billion in assets under management, said Balchunas. Easily the largest is Invesco's QQQ Trust (QQQ) with more than $300 billion in AUM. “The inclusion of MicroStrategy entering the Nasdaq 100 is possibly the second biggest story of 2024, after the launch of the US spot listed ETFs,” said James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk. “These funds are often buyers at any price level on a monthly basis which will add to another buyer of MSTR, when Michael Saylor continues to issue the at-the-market (ATM) offering, to dilute shareholders but will have a bigger base of buyers.” Balchunas' colleague James Seyffart cautions that there’s a chance that MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the index might be short-lived as the company could be re-classified as a financial firm in March since its value comes almost entirely from its bitcoin holdings and not the actual operating business. MicroStrategy founder and Executive Michael Saylor has even said previously that he plans to turn the company into a “bitcoin bank,” making it even less of a technology operation. “The game theory now sees the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY), the largest of all ETFs with about $650 billion in AUM, as maybe needing to include MSTR to rival their competitor," van Straten added. "Millions of investors will now have indirect bitcoin exposure adding to the flywheel effect." The re-shuffling of the Nasdaq 100 and consequently the QQQ and related ETFs will go into effect on Dec. 23.

Title: The long-shot plan to save TikTok from a US ban
URL: https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320722/frank-mccourt-project-liberty-tiktok-us-ban-bytedance
Time Published: 2024-12-13T23:26:28Z
Full Content:
By Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry. So far, ByteDance has shown zero willingness to spin off TikTok in the US. The Chinese parent company seems to be banking on the Supreme Court or President-elect Donald Trump rescuing the app before it’s banned next month. The obvious names that would would buy TikTok if they could — Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, etc. — are sitting on the sidelines and waiting to see what happens in the coming weeks. The clock is ticking. Congress just sent letters to Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook reminding them that they will be legally liable for continuing to host TikTok in their app stores after January 19th. Then there’s Frank McCourt, the real estate billionaire and former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. For months, McCourt has been very public about his desire to buy TikTok. He has ramped up his drumbeat since ByteDance recently lost its legal fight on appeal. This week, he pitched more investors on his Project Liberty plan to buy the app’s US operations. When I spoke with McCourt over Zoom in between those investor meetings, he told me he currently has roughly $20 billion behind him for a bid. He has asked Kevin Mayer, who was briefly TikTok’s CEO the last time it was almost banned from the US, to be involved, though Mayer hasn’t signed on. McCourt told me his team has talked to “most” of ByteDance’s biggest American investors and that they’re “very interested” in his plan. (Spokespeople for these firms either declined to comment or didn’t respond to my pings, and Mayer didn’t have a comment.) There are several reasons McCourt’s attempt to buy TikTok is a long-shot, the biggest being that, even if ByteDance wanted to sell, the Chinese government may not let it. Then there are the technical details of his proposal, which would see TikTok put on a decentralized protocol that is funded by McCourt and untested with a platform of TikTok’s size. For me, the biggest red flag of all is that there’s a cryptocurrency called Frequency tied to the project. McCourt has high-minded ambitions for how the internet should work that are in line with the rise of federated platforms like ActivityPub and Bluesky. He imagines TikTok offering a marketplace of user-created algorithms, much like Bluesky does today, and users having the ability to own their profiles. Keep reading for more from our conversation this week… The following Q&A has been edited for length and clarity. My understanding is there are multiple pieces of Project Liberty. You’ve got the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP) and then the TikTok bid, and they’re connected. It all seems a little bit afield from what you have historically done. Having seen the harms of social media and where the internet was going as it became highly centralized, I dedicated some resources to start a public policy school at my alma mater, Georgetown. I was perhaps naive in retrospect, but I thought that we could get the policymaking apparatus out in front of the problem and steer things in a better direction out of that school. Then I realized that the public policy making apparatus is no match for Big Tech, so I began to go back to my roots. My family has been building infrastructure for 131 years, so this actually isn’t very far afield from our core competency when you think about this not as software at the app layer, but as infrastructure at the base layer. I talked to a few brilliant computer scientists that we have in the company and put the task to them of solving this from an engineering perspective if you had no limitations. The answer came back that you would go ahead and create another protocol that would connect us, just like TCP/IP connects devices and HTTP connects data. Our goal here is bigger than buying TikTok. It’s reimagining how the internet works. Purchasing TikTok and moving 170 million people to a reimagined, upgraded internet would catalyze that alternative and compress time. Is this a financial endeavor or is this philanthropy for you? Do you see a return on investment here? I see it as both and we’ve been very careful to separate the two. Project Liberty has an institute, a 501(c)(3), that’s purely not-for-profit. DSNP has been gifted to the world. That is being supported by the institute. The layer-one blockchain, Frequency, is tokenized. The community will own the majority of the tokens but that will be a commercial endeavor. TikTok, when we buy it, will be a commercial endeavor. If you were given the opportunity to buy it but a condition was that you couldn’t do it on this protocol you built, would you still do it? Probably not because I don’t know how you would achieve the objectives we want to achieve, which is to be able to run the platform without the algorithm and give people ownership and control of their relationships. You need an implementation device to use DSNP. I would be totally open, however, if someone else built an alternative to Frequency. We’re looking to decentralize, not further centralize. Have you studied the fediverse: Mastodon, ActivityPub, and then also what Bluesky is doing? I admire all the people who are doing that because they are trying to improve the internet and respect individuals. A federated approach is very different than having a universal social graph that’s globally accessible. We’re saying that something has to change fundamentally with the internet. What Jay Graber is doing with Bluesky is great but you still have a Bluesky identity. You’re still on Bluesky and your relationships are on Bluesky. Let’s stipulate that it’s better but you’re still there, right? At some point maybe Jay is not there. Give me an update on the status of your investor pitch and how much money you have committed. People are super excited about this and capital will not be an issue at all. The issue is going to be what ByteDance does. We’ve been saying for over six months that we felt the government was going to win the case. I don’t think ByteDance’s appeal is going to be successful. This is going to be a shut-it-down or sell it scenario. Like President-elect Trump, I’d like to see it not banned. We’re not asking China for the algorithm. We’re not an antitrust threat. We’ll pass CFIUS vetting. We don’t need or want the algorithm. We have a clean stack where the user base can migrate. We don’t know what ByteDance is going to decide. We certainly hope they decide to sell and preserve some value for their shareholders. We’ll do it on terms that we think can be a win-win. China keeps the algorithm. US citizens are protected. The app stays alive. Is $20 billion the amount that you still have committed? That’s what we’ve got circled right now and that’s an order of magnitude what we think this is worth. Now, I say that with a huge caveat: we don’t know what ByteDance is selling. We think we have a very good idea of what the current numbers are, but it’s not like there’s a data room that ByteDance has set up and we’re inside of it. I think we have a good sense of what this would be worth if ByteDance keeps the algorithm and sells the user base and the content and the brand. There are three categories of investors. One group is the existing American companies that have invested in ByteDance. We’ve talked to most of them. They’re very interested, assuming ByteDance agrees to sell. They would either put more capital in or keep their capital in. A second category are people that are familiar with the asset because they’ve looked at it in the past. Some are looking at it for the first time. These are the large balance sheets that deploy big amounts of capital and they’re interested in what we’re doing. The third category is the bucket of cultural capital, people with influence who are interested in being a part of this and bringing their communities with them. When will you share who your backers are? We’ll be able to share once we know what ByteDance is doing. It makes no sense to be barking up the wrong tree here. You’ve had no conversations with ByteDance leadership, right? That’s correct. I reached out before the decision. They were not interested in speaking at that time. We’ll try it again. They know at this stage of the game that we exist, we’re interested, and we hope that there’s incoming at some point as well. But we respect their decision-making process. They’re going to decide what they think is best for their interests. Have you spoken to Trump or his team? We’re in the process of reaching out. I’ve heard President-elect Trump say he doesn’t want to see the app banned. I’m very interested in having that conversation once this gets sorted on the China side and they decide what they’re going to do. Are you concerned about other large would-be acquirers, like an Amazon, also circling TikTok? I don’t see the big incumbents being bidders here for a couple of reasons. One is antitrust, obviously. Secondly, imagine you were a tobacco company and you built a big business and then people started to get worried because people were getting sick and dying because of the addiction of cigarettes and carcinogens. If you bought a tobacco company after the surgeon general’s warning, then you were putting a target on your back because you were buying it with the awareness that your product kills people. The growth of these platforms happened really fast. Then we discovered that there are harms. Anybody buying TikTok and replicating the current design, which is to scrape peoples’ data, apply algorithms, and manipulate people, they’re buying this with their eyes wide open. So I don’t see a lot of bidders because people realize they’re just putting a target on their back. Let’s take this problem and actually use it to catalyze an upgraded internet. Then, a lot of the problems go away. A lot of the lawsuits go away. A lot of the harms go away. That’s Project Liberty. Hundreds of the world’s top researchers gathered this week in Vancouver, Canada for NeuralPS, one of the world’s top academic gatherings in the field of AI. I asked The Verge’s Kylie Robison (who just published a fascinating deep dive on the history and future of ChatGPT) what it was like being there on the ground: Are there any recurring themes you’ve been hearing in conversations? The “Is AI hitting a wall?” conversation came up sometimes, but this is not the place where people actually believe that. AI safety was something I wound up talking about a lot. A research topic that also came up a lot was what Fei-Fei Li focuses on, which is helping AI understand the world like we do in terms of physics and objects. That touches a bunch of cool things — robotics, agents, advanced reasoning. Which lab does everyone wish they worked at? This conference was filled with students from Waterloo and University of Toronto who basically want any AI job. (It was quite sweet sometimes watching those students corner an AI exec at a party.) If parties are any indicator, everyone wants to get as close to OpenAI as possible. This is a highly academic conference with lots of people just wanting to do good, deep research. What was the hottest party? The Midjourney party was 4x oversubscribed and researchers kept sending me the RSVP link. Everyone was asking about the secret OpenAI parties, though. There are plenty of interesting takeaways from Mustafa Suleyman’s recent Decoder interview with Nilay Patel. The Microsoft AI CEO doesn’t seem to agree with Sam Altman on the timing of AGI’s arrival, and he revealed that Microsoft won’t train its own frontier models when OpenAI is doing it for them anyway. He also takes some shots at Google’s management culture versus Microsoft’s, which I’m sure will cause some eyes to roll in Mountain View, given the way Suleyman excited. As a follow-up to this conversation, I recommend listening to Sayta Nadella’s interview this week with Brad Gurley and Brad Gerstner. Reading between the lines, it’s clear that there is ongoing tension between the level of compute Altman wants and what Nadella feels comfortable spending. For those closely following Nvidia’s stock price, Nadella also mentions that Microsoft no longer feels GPU constrained but rather constrained by the power requirements for its data centers.

Title: The year in money: inflation eased, optimism ticked upward

By Anna Helhoski, NerdWalletThe battle to get here was certainly an uphill one, but people are generally feeling better about the economy and their finances than they once did. On top of that, the economy has been easing into an ideal, Goldilocks-like position — not running too hot or cooling too quickly.Throughout 2024, consumer sentiment data showed people were fairly positive about the economy and their own finances, even if there’s remaining frustration over elevated prices compared to four years ago.Looking ahead, households are feeling more optimistic about their personal finances in the next year, as the share of those expecting to be in a better financial situation a year from now hit its highest level since February 2020.Combine positive personal vibes with a strong economic picture and it looks like 2024 wasn’t so bad for consumers, after all. But that doesn’t mean there weren’t bumps in the road or potential roadblocks ahead.To cap off the year, NerdWallet writers reflect on the top trends in personal finance and the economy this year — and what they think might be ahead in 2025.The economy steadily grewElizabeth Renter, NerdWallet’s economistWhat happened: In 2024, U.S. consumers have proven resilient following a period of high inflation and ongoing high interest rates. Wage growth has been strong, owing in part to rising productivity. This has driven robust spending throughout the year, which has kept the economy growing at a healthy pace. The labor market has remained steady, though cooler than 2023, and price growth continues to moderate towards the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation goal.

Business | 4 ways to hit your family savings goals in 2025 Business | 5 ways to tell if you’re on track for retirement — and 5 things to do if you need to catch up, according to experts Business | 6 ways to avoid a financial hangover What’s ahead: Barring significant changes to economic policy and significant shocks, the U.S. economy is expected to grow at a moderate rate in the coming year. Inflation will continue to moderate and the labor market will remain relatively healthy, all due in part to continued slow and deliberate rate cuts from the Fed. However, there are risks to this path.Higher tariffs and tighter immigration policies are likely, but the extent of these changes are yet unclear. The potential policy scenarios are many, and the economic outcomes complex. Increased tariffs are generally inflationary, and stricter immigration policies could impact the labor supply and economic growth. Consumers and small business owners with their eyes to the new year should focus on the things within their control.Savings accounts offered high rates and returnsMargarette Burnette, consumer banking and savings writer What happened: High-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit offered elevated rates in 2024, rewarding savers with strong returns. Following the Federal Reserve rate cuts in the second half of the year, high-yield accounts had modest rate decreases, but they continued to outperform traditional savings accounts and CDs.What’s ahead: We’re watching for further Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could lead to more decreases in savings rates.Credit card debt hit a highSara Rathner, credit cards writer What happened: Credit card debt levels hit record highs, with consumers turning to credit cards to pay for necessities. While the economy is doing well, many individuals have struggled to make ends meet, as incomes haven’t kept up with certain costs.What’s ahead: We may see some policy and regulation changes with the incoming administration that could affect folks when it comes to credit cards, debt and consumer protections.Small business boomedRyan Brady, small business writer What happened: New businesses continued to blossom in 2024 as business applications remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Confidence in the future state of the U.S. economy also spiked after the presidential election, but that optimism was tempered by concerns over rising costs and labor quality.What’s ahead: All eyes are on the incoming administration as small-business owners brace for turbulence resulting from potential tariffs, tax policy changes and dismantled government regulations. We’re also watching the possibility of interest rate cuts in 2025 and small-business owners’ growing reliance on new technologies, such as AI.Home buying remained challengingHolden Lewis, mortgages writer What happened: Home buyers struggled with elevated mortgage rates, rising house prices and a shortage of homes for sale. On top of that, a new rule required buyers to negotiate their agents’ commissions.What’s ahead: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut short-term interest rates, but mortgage rates might not necessarily fall by a similar amount. Buyers will probably have more properties to choose from, and the greater supply should keep prices from rising a lot. Interest rates on home equity loans and lines of credit should fall, making it less expensive to borrow to fix up homes — either to sell, or to make the home more comfortable and efficient.The markets were a boon for investorsSam Taube, investing writer What happened: The stock market had a great year. The S&P 500 is up more than 25% due to falling interest rates, fading recession fears, AI hype, and the possibility of lighter taxes and regulations under the new administration. Cryptocurrency also saw big gains in 2024; the price of Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time in December.What’s ahead: A lot depends on how fast the Fed reduces rates in 2025. Another key unknown is Trump’s second term. Regulatory rollbacks, such as those he has proposed for the banking industry, could juice stock prices — but they also could create systemic risks in the economy. His proposed tariffs could also hurt economic growth (and therefore stock prices). Finally, it remains to be seen whether trendy AI stocks, such as NVIDIA, can continue their momentum into next year. It’s the same story with crypto: How long will this bull market last?Premiums went up for home and auto insuranceCaitlin Constantine, assistant assigning editor, insuranceWhat happened: Many people saw their home and auto insurance premiums skyrocket in 2024. In some states, homeowners are finding it harder to even find policies in the first place. Meanwhile, life insurance rates have started to decrease post-pandemic. We also saw more insurers offering online-only policies that don’t require a medical exam.What’s ahead: Auto and home insurance costs will likely continue to rise, although auto premiums may not rise as dramatically as they have over the past few years. And if you’re in the market for life insurance, expect to see competitive life insurance quotes and more customizable policies.Lawsuits and uncertainty over student loan relief continuedEliza Haverstock, student loans writer What happened: Borrowers received historic student loan relief, but lawsuits derailed an income-driven repayment plan used by 8 million whose payments are indefinitely paused. Uncertainty will carry into 2025 as a result of the presidential administration change.What’s ahead: Trump has pledged to overhaul higher education and rein in student loan relief. The fate of the SAVE repayment plan, student loan forgiveness options, FAFSA processing and more remain in the balance.Traveling in style was all the rageMeghan Coyle, assistant assigning editor, travelWhat happened: People are willing to pay more for big and small luxuries while traveling, and airlines and hotels are taking note. Many airlines raised checked bag fees early in 2024, credit card issuers and airlines invested in renovated airport lounges, and major hotel companies continued to add luxury properties and brands to their loyalty programs.What’s ahead: Southwest will say goodbye to its open seating policy and introduce new extra-legroom seats, a major departure for the airline. Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines will unveil a unified loyalty program in 2025. Spirit Airlines may attempt to merge with another airline again after its 2024 bankruptcy filing and two failed mergers under President Biden’s administration. Travelers will find that they’ll have to pay a premium to enjoy most of the upgrades airlines and hotels are making.Dynamic pricing expanded its reachLaura McMullen, assistant assigning editor, personal financeWhat happened: This year, dynamic pricing expanded beyond concerts and travel to online retailers and even fast-food restaurants. This practice of prices changing based on real-time supply and demand received plenty of backlash from consumers and prompted the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how companies use consumers’ data to set prices.What’s ahead: Beyond an expansion of dynamic pricing — perhaps with added oversight — expect subscription models to become more prevalent and demand for sustainable products to grow.The car market came back for buyersShannon Bradley, autos writerWhat happened: New-car prices held steady in 2024 but remained high after a few years of sharp increases — the average new car now sells for about $48,000, and for the first time ever the price gap between new and used cars surpassed $20,000 (average used-car prices are now slightly more than $25,000). Overall, the car market returned to being in the buyer’s favor, as new-car inventories reached pre-pandemic levels, manufacturer incentives began making a comeback and auto loan interest rates started to decline.What’s ahead: The future of the car market is uncertain and depends on policies implemented by the incoming administration. Questions surround the impact of possible tariffs on car prices, whether auto loan rates will continue to drop, and if federal tax credits will still be available for electric vehicle buyers.Buy now, pay later grew in popularityJackie Veling, personal loans writer What happened: Buy now, pay later continued to be a popular payment choice for U.S. shoppers, even while facing headwinds, like an interpretive ruling from the CFPB (which determined BNPL should be regulated the same as credit cards) and Apple’s discontinuation of its popular Apple Pay Later product. Large players like Affirm, Klarna and Afterpay continued to offer interest-free, pay-in-four plans at most major retailers, along with long-term plans for larger purchases.What’s ahead: Though more regulation had been widely anticipated in 2025, the change in administration suggests the CFPB will play a less active role in regulating BNPL products. For this reason, and its continued strength in the market, BNPL will likely keep growing.Inflation eased, finallyTaryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Easing inflation was a bright spot in 2024. In June, the consumer price index fell below 3% for the first time in three years. Consumers saw prices level off or decline for many goods, including for groceries, gas and new and used vehicles. But prices haven’t fallen far enough or broadly enough to relieve the pinch many households feel.What’s ahead: The new and higher tariffs proposed by the Trump administration could reignite inflation on a wide range of goods.Rents were still high, but price growth slowedTaryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Rent prices remain high, but annual rent inflation slowed significantly compared to recent years, staying around 3.5% for much of 2024, according to Zillow, a real estate website that tracks rents. A wave of newly constructed rental units on the market seems to be helping ease competition among renters and forcing landlords to offer better incentives for signing a lease.What’s ahead: If it continues, a softening rental market could work in renters’ favor. But construction is one of several industries that could see a shortage of workers if the Trump administration follows through on its promise to deport undocumented immigrants. A shortage of workers would mean fewer houses and apartments could be built.Trump won the election, promised tariffs and deportationsAnna Helhoski, news writer What happened: After a contentious presidential campaign, former President Donald Trump declared victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. While on the campaign trail, Trump promised to lower inflation, cut taxes, enact tariffs, weaken the power of the Federal Reserve, deport undocumented immigrants and more. Many economists have said Trump’s proposals, if enacted, would likely be inflationary. In Congress, Republicans earned enough seats to control both houses.What’s ahead: It’s unclear which campaign promises Trump will fulfill on his own and with the support of the new Congress. He has promised a slew of “day one” actions that could lead to higher prices, including across-the-board tariffs and mass deportations. Most recently, Trump pledged to enact 20% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on China. He has also promised to extend or make permanent the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; many of its provisions expire by the end of 2025.Congress squabbled while consumer-first, antitrust efforts wonAnna Helhoski, news writer What happened: Fiscal year 2023-2024’s funding saga finally came to an end in March, then six months later, the battle to fund the fiscal year 2024-2025 began. The Biden Administration waged its own war against junk fees. Antitrust enforcers pushed back against tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta; prevented the Kroger-Albertsons merger; nixed the Jet Blue-Spirit Airlines merger; and moved to ban noncompete agreements. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as a challenge to abortion pill access. SCOTUS also overruled its landmark Chevron case, which means every federal regulatory agency’s power to set and enforce its own rules are now weaker.What’s ahead: The election’s red sweep means the GOP will control the executive and legislative branches of government. They’ll face the threat of at least one more potential government shutdown; a debt ceiling drama comeback; and the beginning of the debate over extending or making permanent provisions of the expiring 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

He has also promised to extend or make permanent the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; many of its provisions expire by the end of 2025. Anna Helhoski, news writer What happened: Fiscal year 2023-2024’s funding saga finally came to an end in March, then six months later, the battle to fund the fiscal year 2024-2025 began. The Biden Administration waged its own war against junk fees. Antitrust enforcers pushed back against tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta; prevented the Kroger-Albertsons merger; nixed the Jet Blue-Spirit Airlines merger; and moved to ban noncompete agreements. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as a challenge to abortion pill access. SCOTUS also overruled its landmark Chevron case, which means every federal regulatory agency’s power to set and enforce its own rules are now weaker. What’s ahead: The election’s red sweep means the GOP will control the executive and legislative branches of government. They’ll face the threat of at least one more potential government shutdown; a debt ceiling drama comeback; and the beginning of the debate over extending or making permanent provisions of the expiring 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Title: Broadcom hits $1T market cap after CEO’s ‘huge’ AI prediction
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/12/13/business/broadcom-hits-1t-market-cap-after-ceos-huge-ai-prediction/

Broadcom is predicting a massive expansion in demand for chips that power AI — and the market, for now, is buying it all the way. The company’s valuation hit $1 trillion on Friday as its shares surged 21% after CEO Hock Tan said AI could present a $60 billion to $90 billion revenue opportunity in 2027, more than four times the current size of the market. Broadcom also forecast first-quarter revenue above estimates on Thursday. Several analysts said it was tough to estimate the market’s growth and Broadcom’s potential share, with TD Cowen noting the prediction is “difficult to prove/disprove, but is huge.” Big Tech’s push to diversify beyond Nvidia’s pricey and supply-constrained AI processors has been a windfall for Broadcom, which makes custom chips for major cloud companies. Investors have also favored chipmakers that are already benefiting from the massive data centers being built by the likes of Microsoft and Meta amid worries about the payoff from AI investments for the wider tech industry. Broadcom CEO Tan said on Thursday the company has won two major hyperscaler customers, after it brought in $12.2 billion in AI revenue for fiscal 2024. That represented a major chunk of his estimated total serviceable market of $15 billion to $20 billion. Of the total 2027 opportunity, Broadcom could capture as much as $50 billion in AI sales based on the 70% market share Broadcom estimated it had in 2024, TD Cowen analysts said. But they warned modeling the company’s share was difficult because the serviceable market could include processors sold by the likes of Nvidia. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann estimated a much lower market share for Broadcom in 2027 at between 20% and 50%. Investors, meanwhile, scooped up the stock that trades at a lower multiple than rivals. Broadcom has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 29.8, compared with 31.03 for Nvidia, the first chip firm to hit $1 trillion in market value, according to data compiled by LSEG. “As AI shifts from training models to inference, more and more chip companies will gain an edge on Nvidia. Broadcom is the canary in the coalmine,” said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital. Shares of Nvidia and rival AI chipmaker AMD fell about 3%, while Broadcom’s smaller competitor Marvell rose close to 9%. Contract chipmaker TSMC rose 4%. Broadcom’s shares are up more than 60% this year, while Nvidia’s stock has more than doubled, as of last close. The gains eclipse those in major cloud companies, with Microsoft up about 11% this year and Alphabet — seen by analysts as Broadcom’s biggest custom chip customer — rising 40%. “They (Broadcom) went out of their way to give investors a reason to dream,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. “The AI story seems to really be coming into its own, perhaps Hock might think about shopping for a leather jacket,” Rasgon said, referring to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s signature style.

Major U.S. indexes were slightly lower at midday Friday as the markets took a break from their record-setting performance following the presidential election last month. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all lost ground. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares tumbled amid concerns the computer server maker’s stock could be knocked off the Nasdaq 100 Index. Shares of Charles Schwab (SCHW) also fell as the discount brokerage and asset manager reported its sweep cash in November was flat from the month before. EVgo (EVGO) shares took off after the federal government granted the electric vehicle charging station network $1.25 billion in loan guarantees. Broadcom (AVGO) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500, with shares hitting an all-time high after the chipmaker posted better-than-expected results and projected strong demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) products. Shares of Penn Entertainment (PENN) gained as the casino operator got an upgrade and price target hike from JPMorgan, anticipating growth as its investments begin to pay off. RH (RH) shares soared after the home furnishings retailer boosted its full-year outlook and swung to a profit, despite a weak housing market. Oil futures rose and gold prices dropped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note advanced. The U.S. dollar was up on the pound and yen, but lost ground to the euro. Most major cryptocurrencies traded lower. TradingView

Title: Broadcom's AI Chip Leadership Puts Pressure on Nvidia and Marvell, Analysts Say

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock surged Friday after it reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter adjusted EPS results and raised its quarterly common stock dividend. The company reported a topline of $14.05 billion, up from $9.3 billion, compared to the analyst estimate of $14.57 billion. EPS of $1.42 missed the analyst consensus of $1.46. Also Read: T-Mobile’s Premium Valuation Prompts Downgrade As Growth Projections Decelerate: Analyst Broadcom expects first-quarter revenue of ~$14.60 billion, almost in line with the $14.61 billion consensus estimate. Multiple Wall Street analysts rerated the stock after the print: Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann maintained Broadcom with a Buy and raised the price target from $240 to $250. B of A Securities analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Broadcom with a Buy and raised the price target from $215 to $250. JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur maintained Broadcom with an Overweight and raised the price target from $210 to $250. Rosenblatt: Broadcom came in with a slight beat on continued AI and networking momentum and some VMWare first-quarter pushouts. Non-AI dynamics continue to demonstrate modest cyclical recovery. The Street will pivot on management’s disclosure of the line-of-sight AI serviceable available market (SAM) at its current custom ASIC (XPU) 3 hyperscaler customers of $60 billion—$90 billion by 2027, up from the $15 billion—$20 billion level in 2024. Interestingly, Broadcom has two new potential engagements that could eventually match the size of the current three. The AI 3-year outlook supports the ~60% CAGR of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) TAM of $500 billion for the 2027 and 2028 timeframes. Management implied strong prospects for maintaining AI custom ASIC leadership and share gains over Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs. Broadcom already has working custom ASIC 3nm silicon that will ship this Spring, well ahead of anybody in the market. While custom ASIC sister Marvell Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL) is also in the 3nm race, it is roughly a year behind Broadcom. Mosesmann’s fiscal 2025 revenue and adjusted EPS estimates remain unchanged. B of A Securities: The rerating reflects Broadcom’s expanding custom-chip (ASIC) AI, surging AI opportunity, and potential to maintain a position at large wireless customer Apple. Near-term results were inline, though the pushout of some software deals from the fourth to the first quarter helped Broadcom guide the first quarter inline versus concerns of missing due to seasonal headwinds, the analyst said. Arya projected fiscal 2025 revenue of $61.1 billion (prior $59.3 billion) and EPS of $6.27 (prior $6.00). He expects fiscal 2026 revenue of $70.2 billion (prior $68.5 billion) and EPS of $7.50 (prior $7.31). His forecast implies a growth trajectory of about 15% sales and 20% EPS over the next three years across a diversified silicon and infrastructure software base. Based on Broadcom’s leading capabilities and IP in leading-edge logic, networking, memory, and interface design, Arya projected its AI sales to grow from $12 billion in the current year to about $30 billion by calendar 2027. However, Arya noted an upside to a 30% EPS CAGR towards $11-$12/share by calendar 2027, assuming AI sales get to $53 billion instead, based on Broadcom maintaining its current 70% share of a larger $75 billion SAM. There could be further upside since, per Broadcom, the stated range is only for its current three customer’s “line-of-sight” intention to each build 1 million unit custom accelerator (XPU) clusters requiring an 80% and 20% mix of compute and networking. JP Morgan: Broadcom delivered solid fourth-quarter quarterly results on continued strong sequential growth in its AI semiconductor segment, which offset lower software revenues. For the first quarter, Broadcom guided revenues in line with consensus expectations and better than market expectations on sustained strong AI demand and software revenue acceleration. The fiscal 2024 AI revenues were $12.2 billion, up 3 times year-on-year. Sur expects them to grow to $17 billion-$18 billion (+40% Y/Y) in fiscal 2025, given continued strong cloud and hyperscaler capex spending trends with a focus on AI infrastructure build-out and second-half ramp of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google’s next-gen TPU v6 3nm AI accelerator ASIC. More importantly, Broadcom expects the AI SAM opportunity for its three existing cloud/hyperscalers to accelerate, driven by continued substantial investments in multi-generational XPU road maps and larger cluster sizes. Even applying a more conservative market share assumption, Sur noted that Broadcom’s AI business is growing at a 40%- 50%+ revenue CAGR over the next several years. In the near term, despite a product handoff from the TPU v6 inference chip at 5nm to the TPU v6 training chip at 3nm, Broadcom is still guiding for sequential growth in its AI revenues for the first quarter. The TPU v6 3nm training chip will likely move into a high volume ramp in the second half of next fiscal year, and this one SKU Sur noted can drive $8 billion+ for Broadcom in fiscal 2025. Given its portfolio breadth, diversification, and product cycles, Broadcom continues to drive a stable revenue growth profile even during macro volatility. Broadcom generated strong free cash flow for the year, which resulted in an 11% dividend increase. Sur projected fiscal 2025 revenue of $62.7 billion and EPS of $6.50.

Title: Hyundai CEO vows the ‘best is yet to come’ with new EVs and advanced tech arriving soon

Despite an impressive year in 2024, Hyundai Motor Group chairman Euisun Chung told employees that even more is on the way — and it’s coming very soon. With new EVs and advanced tech launching, Hyundai’s chief said, “The real best is yet to come.” Hyundai Motor Group, including Kia and Genesis, is having a big year. Global sales are on track for another record-breaking performance. According to the company’s CEO, Hyundai is just getting started. On Thursday, during a town hall meeting at the company’s advanced new innovation center in Singapore, Chung told executives and employees, “Our journey has been amazing so far, but the real best is yet to come.” Hyundai opened the new smart facility last November to build custom EVs. Buyers can personalize their vehicles from home. You can even book a test drive on the company’s 675-yard (618-meter) rooftop sky track to get a better feel for the car. In Hyundai’s words, the innovation center “provides unprecedented ways for EV buyers to interact with their vehicles and the Hyundai brand.” The facility is filled with robots that carry out around 50% of the tasks. Custom-built EVs, like the IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6, and autonomous robotaxis are currently built at the facility. Now, Hyundai is expanding the “Software Defined Factory (FSD)” to other key regions. Chung said the AI, IT, and robotics used in Singapore will “gradually expand to domestic and overseas EV-only factories, including Hyundai Motor Group Meta Plant America.” Hyundai began production at its massive new EV plant in Georgia in October, after the first US-made IONIQ 5 rolled off the assembly line. The updated 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 features a bigger battery with more range and a sleek new design. It even comes with an NACS port for charging at Tesla Superchargers. Hyundai will build its first three-row electric SUV, the IONIQ 9, alongside it, which will roll out next year. Hyundai is coming off its best sales month ever in the US, its most important market. However, the company expects to become even more prominent with advanced new locally made models. It's pretty easy to get behind a company that is trying to produce great value vehicles like Hyundai, and ramping up their EV production as the market adjusts. I only wish Toyota was this aggressive and enthusiastic about making EVs. The record sales are “driven by the strong performance of our EV and hybrid vehicles,” Hyundai Motor America CEO Randy Parker explained. Parker added excitement is building for the US-built IONIQ 9, and “we can’t wait to bring it to market.” Hyundai’s EV sales were up 77% in the US last month. With nearly 5,000 units sold, the IONIQ 5 had its best sales month ever, just as 2025 models arrive at dealerships. And it’s not only in the US. Hyundai will introduce the new tech to its dedicated EV plant in Ulsan and a complete knock down factory in Saudi Arabia as it looks to expand its global footprint. With the new 2025 IONIQ 5 arriving at dealerships, Hyundai is offering clearance prices on 2024 models. The 2024 Hyundai IONIQ 5 is available to lease for as low as $199 per month while they are still in stock.

Title: Ozempic could be linked to a common cause of sudden blindness, another study finds

Read more: What’s ahead for weight loss drugs in 2025, according to Noom’s CEO Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-0.16%) blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic may have a potential link with an eye condition that causes vision loss, according to a non-peer reviewed study published Thursday on medRxiv. Diabetes patients using Ozempic were found to be over twice as likely to develop a rare eye condition known as NAION compared to those taking other diabetes medications, according to researchers who analyzed years of patient data from Denmark and Norway. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Still, the study determined that the overall incidence of the condition was exceptionally low, with just 1.4 additional cases per 10,000 patient-years of observation — calculated as the number of patients multiplied by the years they were monitored — among those taking Ozempic compared to users of other diabetes medications. If the risk remains consistent over time, a type 2 diabetes patient taking Ozempic for 20 years would face a 0.3% to 0.5% likelihood of developing NAION, according to the study. The findings for Wegovy — the company’s weight-loss drug that shares the same active ingredient as Ozempic — were inconclusive due to an insufficient number of patients in the analysis. Wegovy didn’t launch in Denmark until 2022 and in Norway until 2023. NAION is a condition in which blood flow in the optic nerve — a bundle of nerve fibers that connects the back of the eye to the brain — is reduced leading to sudden and irreversible blindness. The condition is the most common optic nerve disease in the United States, affecting up to 10 out of 100,000 older Americans every year, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. This study follows another one from earlier this year that also found a link between semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, and NAION. “Given the well-established effects of semaglutide in managing both diabetes and obesity, it is crucial to weigh the potential risk of NAION against the substantial therapeutic benefits of semaglutide,” the researchers wrote. “Patient safety is a top priority for Novo Nordisk, and we take all reports about adverse events from use of our medicines very seriously,” a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told Quartz in an emailed statement. The company said it had reviewed all available data on NAION in relation to its semaglutide products, including scientific literature, non-clinical studies, clinical trial results, post-marketing reports, and the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). This review found no evidence of a causal link between semaglutide and NAION. The company also clarified that NAION is not listed as a known side effect for its branded semaglutide products including Ozempic and Wegovy, according to their official labels. Additionally, after a review of this new study, Novo Nordisk reached the opinion that “that the benefit-risk profile of semaglutide remains unchanged.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. I used to be bullish on semiconductor designer and manufacturer Intel (INTC), but following the board’s decision to remove the CEO, I’m left uncertain about the company’s future. Instead, semiconductor designer AMD (AMD) is firing on all cylinders, with robust management and a fortified market position. As a result, I’m bullish on AMD and think it can generate a reliable 60% or more total price return in the next 24 months. Discover top-rated stocks from highly ranked analysts with Analyst Top Stocks! Easily identify outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Pat Gelsinger, the CEO of Intel, was ousted from his position on December 1, 2024, causing a downgrade in my rating for its stock from a Buy to a Hold. The board lost confidence in his ambitious and costly turnaround strategy, much of which depended on developing a robust advanced semiconductor manufacturing division called Intel Foundry Services. This vital direction was meant to help the West protect itself from the concentrated advanced chip manufacturing operations in Taiwan, which is close to authoritarian China. However, the board concluded that his plans were not delivering results quickly enough to address Intel’s financial struggles and competitive pressures. Indeed, during Gelsinger’s tenure, Intel’s market value significantly declined, falling to less than 30 times that of Nvidia (NVDA), the world’s strongest chip designer. Another way of looking at it is that Intel stock dropped more than 60% under Gelsinger’s tenure. Therefore, it’s understandable why the board was not pleased. However, tackling both advanced semiconductor manufacturing and competitive chip design was never going to be easy. Maybe management, led by Gelsinger, bit off more than it could chew, but a critical weakness in Western geopolitics remains. The world relies on Taiwan’s TSMC (TSM) for manufacturing 92% of advanced semiconductors. Not only does Gelsinger’s ousting and the uncertainty of the direction the company will take next spell trouble for Intel investors, but it also leaves the U.S. and the West vulnerable in the long term if the company decides to scrap its foundry plans. Many investors, including myself, are hoping the company will sell Intel Foundry Services to an entity that can focus wholeheartedly on fortifying Western semiconductor manufacturing interests. Previously, when I analyzed Intel, I considered it to offer a compelling 18-month value opportunity based on momentarily depressed sentiment. However, given that the board has now ousted the CEO (who had the most semiconductor experience of anyone in the company—the board has several members with no semiconductor experience), the near-term value thesis has become uncertain. As a result, I have downgraded my rating from a Buy to a Hold. My valuation model for Intel currently shows a negative margin of safety of -1.04%, based on a 2026 revenue estimate of $59.5 billion, a 2026 EBITDA estimate of $16.36 billion, and an EV-to-EBITDA terminal multiple of 8.5 (which reflects increased sentiment as the company enters a profit-harvesting phase in the near future). The result of my model shows a 2026 enterprise value of $139.05 billion and a present-day intrinsic enterprise value of $116.23 billion, compared to a current enterprise value of $117.45 billion. My intrinsic enterprise value is calculated using a discount rate of 9.4%, approximately equal to the company’s weighted average cost of capital. On Wall Street, Intel has a consensus Hold rating based on one Buy, 22 Holds, and six Sells. The average INTC price target of $24.43 per share indicates 19.05% upside potential over the next 12 months, reflecting that the near-term value thesis may remain intact. However, I am less convinced that the board and its new additions will be able to steer the ship to prosperity. See more INTC analyst ratings In contrast to Intel, AMD has demonstrated remarkable resilience, stability, growth, and market leadership in the semiconductor industry, leading me to be highly bullish on the company. It has consistently prioritized technological advancements across high-performance computing, AI chip development, and gaming and consumer electronics. AMD has delivered year-over-year EBITDA growth of 47.05% compared to just 8.76% for Intel. AMD is experiencing high growth at the moment primarily due to its Data Center segment. In Q3 2024, Data Center revenue accounted for 52% of AMD’s total revenue, reflecting a 122% year-over-year increase. Management has forecast the company’s Q4 revenue to grow 22% year-over-year to $7.5 billion. Given these remarkable results that prove operational efficiency and organizational order, AMD is simply much more compelling than Intel to invest in based on objective data. It’s worth considering that the semiconductor market is cyclical. Therefore, the major players like Nvidia and AMD are prone to a valuation collapse at some point in the next three to eight years, based on my analysis. This depends on how the demand from Big Tech companies for AI infrastructure evolves. Yet, at this time, there is no indication of a slowdown in the build-out of advanced data centers for AI. Therefore, I remain bullish on AMD for the foreseeable future. By December 2026, AMD’s total revenue is likely to be approximately $40 billion, based on my analysis. If the company maintains an EV-to-sales ratio of approximately 8.5 (which is the midpoint of its current forward and trailing 12-month ratios), the company will have an enterprise value of $340 billion. Its current enterprise value is $204.99 billion, so an allocation today could render approximately a 65% total price return in two years based on my forecasts. On Wall Street, AMD has a consensus Moderate Buy rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and zero Sells. The average AMD price target of $184.33 per share implies 42.34% upside potential over the next 12 months, strongly supporting my independent analysis and personal Buy rating for the stock. See more AMD analyst ratings AMD is currently part of my growth portfolio strategy, and I have set a ‘take profit’ price target of $175, which I am likely to elevate as time progresses. I have considered investing in Intel previously, but given the current uncertainty, I prefer to allocate capital to robust management teams and fortified market positions. AMD offers this in spades, while Intel has shown repeated inconsistency that leaves its investment case currently fragile. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

However, given that the board has now ousted the CEO (who had the most semiconductor experience of anyone in the company—the board has several members with no semiconductor experience), the near-term value thesis has become uncertain. As a result, I have downgraded my rating from a Buy to a Hold. My valuation model for Intel currently shows a negative margin of safety of -1.04%, based on a 2026 revenue estimate of $59.5 billion, a 2026 EBITDA estimate of $16.36 billion, and an EV-to-EBITDA terminal multiple of 8.5 (which reflects increased sentiment as the company enters a profit-harvesting phase in the near future). The result of my model shows a 2026 enterprise value of $139.05 billion and a present-day intrinsic enterprise value of $116.23 billion, compared to a current enterprise value of $117.45 billion. My intrinsic enterprise value is calculated using a discount rate of 9.4%, approximately equal to the company’s weighted average cost of capital. On Wall Street, Intel has a consensus Hold rating based on one Buy, 22 Holds, and six Sells. The average INTC price target of $24.43 per share indicates 19.05% upside potential over the next 12 months, reflecting that the near-term value thesis may remain intact. However, I am less convinced that the board and its new additions will be able to steer the ship to prosperity. See more INTC analyst ratings In contrast to Intel, AMD has demonstrated remarkable resilience, stability, growth, and market leadership in the semiconductor industry, leading me to be highly bullish on the company. It has consistently prioritized technological advancements across high-performance computing, AI chip development, and gaming and consumer electronics. AMD has delivered year-over-year EBITDA growth of 47.05% compared to just 8.76% for Intel. AMD is experiencing high growth at the moment primarily due to its Data Center segment. In Q3 2024, Data Center revenue accounted for 52% of AMD’s total revenue, reflecting a 122% year-over-year increase. Management has forecast the company’s Q4 revenue to grow 22% year-over-year to $7.5 billion. Given these remarkable results that prove operational efficiency and organizational order, AMD is simply much more compelling than Intel to invest in based on objective data. It’s worth considering that the semiconductor market is cyclical. Therefore, the major players like Nvidia and AMD are prone to a valuation collapse at some point in the next three to eight years, based on my analysis. This depends on how the demand from Big Tech companies for AI infrastructure evolves. Yet, at this time, there is no indication of a slowdown in the build-out of advanced data centers for AI. Therefore, I remain bullish on AMD for the foreseeable future. By December 2026, AMD’s total revenue is likely to be approximately $40 billion, based on my analysis. If the company maintains an EV-to-sales ratio of approximately 8.5 (which is the midpoint of its current forward and trailing 12-month ratios), the company will have an enterprise value of $340 billion. Its current enterprise value is $204.99 billion, so an allocation today could render approximately a 65% total price return in two years based on my forecasts. On Wall Street, AMD has a consensus Moderate Buy rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and zero Sells. The average AMD price target of $184.33 per share implies 42.34% upside potential over the next 12 months, strongly supporting my independent analysis and personal Buy rating for the stock. See more AMD analyst ratings AMD is currently part of my growth portfolio strategy, and I have set a ‘take profit’ price target of $175, which I am likely to elevate as time progresses. I have considered investing in Intel previously, but given the current uncertainty, I prefer to allocate capital to robust management teams and fortified market positions. AMD offers this in spades, while Intel has shown repeated inconsistency that leaves its investment case currently fragile. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: OpenAI’s Sam Altman to Donate $1 Million to Trump Inauguration

Altman joins Meta and Amazon in making big pledges towards the president-elect’s inauguration bash OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is planning on donating $1 million to president-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund, Fox News reported Friday. Altman’s gift comes after Trump already banked two major tech donations this week, with Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta and Amazon both donating $1 million toward Trump’s inauguration. Altman’s contribution is different than the other tech giants, though, in that he’s personally making the donation, not the company he runs. “President Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead,” Altman said in statement to Fox News. The donations come as Big Tech has looked to build a good rapport with Trump heading into his second term. Trump reportedly met with Sundar Pichai, the head of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, on Thursday, and he’s planning on meeting with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos next week. Pichai on Friday told Semafor he’s interested in being part of an artificial intelligence version of the “Manhattan Project” under Trump. “I think there is a chance for us to work as a country together,” Pichai told the outlet. “These big, physical infrastructure projects to accelerate progress is something we would be very excited by.” And when it comes to Trump’s relationship with tech, his bond with X and Tesla boss Elon Musk is the most obvious. Musk donated more than $100 million to help Trump beat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election via his America PAC, the pro-Trump political action committee he launched. The world’s richest man — who has seen Tesla’s stock price surge 73% since Election Day — made several campaign appearances alongside Trump in the weeks leading up to the election. Earlier this week, following Tesla’s big stock rally and a new valuation for SpaceX, his rocket company, Musk’s net worth surpassed $400 billion.

Title: Why Is Costco Stock Up 2x S&P 500 This Year?

Note: Costco FY’24 ended on September 1, 2024. RICHMOND, CALIFORNIA - JULY 11: In an aerial view, the Costco logo is displayed on the exterior of a ... [+] Costco store on July 11, 2024 in Richmond, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Warehouse club operator Costco (NASDAQ: COST) stock is up 52% since the beginning of this year, almost 2x the return of the S&P 500 over the same period. In comparison, Costco’s peer Walmart’s (NYSE: WMT) stock has swelled about 80% over the same period. Another competitor is having a good year, too. See What’s Happening With Amazon Stock? So what’s happening with Costco stock? Costco reported earnings and intraday (Dec. 13) is up 1.5% near $1000 per share. Costco beat both on top and bottom lines in its fiscal first quarter, which ended November 24. The retailer reported $4.04 (up 13% year-over-year) in earnings per share on $62.15 billion (up 8% y-o-y) in revenue. The market was anticipating $3.79 and $62.08 billion, respectively. Comparable sales for the total company (and U.S.) increased 5.2% y-o-y. Traffic rose 5.1% globally and 4.9% in the U.S. In addition, the company’s average ticket was up 0.1% worldwide and 0.3% in the U.S., including the negative impact of gas deflation and foreign exchange rates. Costco has shown a consistent performance at driving revenue, coupled with its dedication to enhancing customer experience, reflecting its ability to thrive in the ever-changing retail landscape. Several club stores have been opened in the U.S. and the company is well-positioned for continued growth overseas, including in China. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Despite the pandemic and inflationary pressures, the business has grown strongly. It should be noted that Costco makes a majority of its profits from its membership income, so comparable sales growth isn’t as important for it as it is for other retailers. In Q1, membership fee income of $1.2 billion was 8% higher than the prior-year period. This quarter marked the full impact of the 8.3% fee increase which took place on September 1, 2024. The cost of a premium membership increased to $130 from $120 and the maximum annual 2% reward for its executive membership rose to $1,250 from $1,000. Also, the annual charge for its basic membership fee grew to $65 from $60. Costco usually increases its membership fees every five years and the last hike was seen in 2017. Inflation over the past two years may have contributed to the seven-year gap this time. Admirably, COST stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years Returns for the stock were 52% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 49% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. The retailer ended the first quarter with 77.4 million paid household members, up 8% y-o-y, and 139 million cardholders, up 7%, with continuing growth throughout the previous quarters. In terms of renewal rates, at the Q1 end, its U.S. and Canada renewal rates were 92.8%, down 0.1% from the Q4 end. The worldwide rate came in at 90.4%, also down 0.1%. The company’s renewal rates are seeing some impact from higher growth in digital sign-ups, which renew at a slightly lower rate than the base as a whole. A high renewal rate not only ensures a steady stream of revenue from membership fees but also increases the lifetime value of each customer, thereby boosting overall profitability. We need to monitor this metric when calculating Costco’s long-term growth potential. We have revised COST’s valuation to $973 per share, based on a $18.07 expected EPS and a 53.9x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2025 - slightly below the current market price. We forecast COST’s Revenues to be around $273 billion for the fiscal year 2025, up 7% y-o-y. The stock’s current valuation at 54 times earnings is much higher than the 25 to 30 P/E range before the pandemic, which means investors could see a couple of scenarios play out. There is the possibility that the shares could decline until the valuation falls in line, especially if a recession sinks the broader stock market. Alternatively, the stock may oscillate as earnings grow and valuations catch up. High inflationary pressures on food still burden consumers, so retail companies like Costco will benefit as cost savings are passed to customers. Costco also began selling gold in August 2023 and silver in late January of this year. The company prices the product attractively, providing members gold at ~2% above spot prices before a 2% cash back reward for executive members and another 2% cash back for those with the Citi card. It is also helpful to see how its peers stack up. Check out how COST’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Title: Broadcom stock soars 20% as AI demand powers the company to a $1 trillion market cap

Broadcom (AVGO-3.40%) has surpassed the $1 trillion market cap for the first time after it reported a 220% jump in artificial intelligence revenue. The chipmaker’s shares were up by about 20% during Friday morning trading, pushing its market cap to $1.02 trillion. Broadcom stock is up by about 10o% so far this year. The San Jose-based company reported revenues of $14.05 billion for the fourth quarter ended in November — a 51% increase from the previous year. Net income was $4.32 billion — a 23% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, revenue in Broadcom’s semiconductor solutions group, which develops its AI chips, rose 12% from the same quarter last year to $8.23 billion. “Semiconductor revenue was a record $30.1 billion driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion,” Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement. “AI revenue which grew 220 percent year-on-year was driven by our leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio.” On the company’s earnings call, Tan said Broadcom sees “our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive.” He added that “specific hyperscalers have begun their respective journeys to develop their own custom AI accelerators.” Tan said Broadcom is developing AI chips, which it refers to as XPUs, with three of its hyper-scale customers, and that the company expects each customer to deploy one million AI chips in networked clusters by 2027. This could lead the total market opportunity for its XPUs and other AI networking to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal year 2027, Tan said. Broadcom set revenue guidance at $14.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Earlier this week, The Information reported that iPhone maker Apple (AAPL+0.25%) is developing its first AI chip, internally known as Baltra, with Broadcom.

Plus: Inside The Food Industry’s Biggest Buyback Of 2024 Good morning, BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, is now making the case for bitcoin in your traditional 60/40 investment portfolio. In new research from its Investment Institute, BlackRock analysts recommend that bitcoin, long shunned by mainstream investors, should now account for 1% to 2% of such portfolios. That would give the cryptocurrency, with a market cap of about $2 trillion, a risk level similar to companies like Nvidia, Amazon or Apple. Still, bitcoin is incredibly volatile, dropping as much as 70% in a year, so the analysts found that weighting it higher than 2% gets exponentially risky. Let’s get into the headlines, Illustration by Emily Scherer for Forbes; Photo by Chakkapong Khachonchit/Getty Images An underworld of sex workers, drug dealers and gamblers use Venmo to run their operations, most of which fly under the radar of law enforcement among millions of Venmo users. It is extremely difficult to estimate how much of Venmo’s total transactions are generated from vices, but Forbes estimates the underground economy on Venmo to be between $1 billion and $2 billion annually. In a rare 2024 tech IPO, ServiceTitan went public Thursday, closing 42% above an already higher-than-anticipated list price of $71, valuing the business at $8.9 billion by the end of day. Its public debut is a boon for a tech IPO market that has been relatively slow since the frothiness of 2021, when a wave of companies like Robinhood, Bumble and Duolingo went public. The Avalanche Foundation raised $250 million via a private token sale for its blockchain platform, a big-ticket round that had largely gone extinct during crypto winter. The Ethereum rival already has $3 billion in capital in its treasury, but its cofounder Emin Gün Sirer said the main goal “was to get alignment and incentivize the right kinds of partners to build with.” Shares of Photoshop maker Adobe plummeted 14% Thursday after lowering its revenue forecast for the current fiscal year, despite reporting record revenue and earnings. Adobe outperformed Wall Street’s projections four of its quarters of 2024, but its stock has fallen 18% this year as the company has estimated slower revenue growth. Andrejs Zavadskis for Forbes Pawel Chudzinski, now the cofounder of venture fund Point Nine Capital, got in on the ground floor of Berlin’s burgeoning startup scene. He now tops Forbes’ Midas List Europe, a ranking of the continent’s best venture capital investors, thanks to a string of smart early bets on British fintech phenom Revolut (which raised in August at a $45 billion valuation), blockchain analysis tool Chainalysis (now valued at $8.6 billion) and healthcare booking unicorn Docplanner. Almost half of the female students at a small private high school in Pennsylvania were the victims of AI-generated pornography, the largest-known instance of deepfake pornography made of minors in the U.S. “The trauma that they have endured in learning that their privacy has been violated in this manner is unimaginable,” District Attorney Heather Adams said. Two teenage boys, both minors, have been criminally charged in the case. Donald Trump was named Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” following his election win, the second time the publication has named the president-elect for the title. “Since he began running for president in 2015, perhaps no single individual has played a larger role in changing the course of politics and history than Trump,” editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs wrote. President Joe Biden granted clemency to 1,500 people on Thursday, the most in a single day by any president, two weeks after controversially pardoning his son Hunter. Reports also suggest Biden is considering preemptive pardons for several people Trump may target after he takes office, including people like Rep. Adam Schiff and former Rep. Liz Cheney, both of whom served on the House Jan. 6 committee, as well as Anthony Fauci. Meta donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, just weeks after its CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago in an apparent bid to mend a tense relationship for years. The New York Times previously reported that Trump’s Inaugural Committee was offering special access to donors who either contribute $1 million or raise $2 million, including tickets to inaugural events. Amazon is also reportedly planning to donate $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, and founder Jeff Bezos is set to have dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago next week. Hot Ones host Sean Evans BuzzFeed sold First We Feast, the studio that produces the popular Hot Ones interview show where celebrities eat increasingly hot chicken wings, for $82.5 million to a group of investors. First We Feast will operate as an independent company and plans to expand into new areas, including “new platforms, live events, and talent acquisition,” First We Feast CEO Chris Schonberger said in a statement. A court recently ruled that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) must get approval from the SEC to move forward with its expedited proceeding to expel Utah penny stock clearing firm Alpine Securities from membership. The move hamstrings one of the most prominent financial regulatory bodies in the U.S., especially at a time when the incoming Republican administration has pledged large-scale deregulation across industries. Courtesy of Mr. Yoshida's TOPLINE The label of Mr. Yoshida’s Japanese-style barbecue sauce features a photo of its charismatic founder in his signature look: a cowboy hat, glasses, and a wide, yee-haw smile. The joy emanating from his grinning, floating head is a key part of the image that Yoshida has fostered over the past four decades as his brand grew. “That history of a great American dream is still surviving in this country,” says Junki Yoshida, who recently turned 75. “It’s me.” The optimism belies what has been a sweet and sour ride for Yoshida. After the Kyoto-born entrepreneur moved to Seattle at 19, his family renounced him. So a soupçon of revenge stirred into the recipe when, in 1982, he started creating a sauce in his Oregon basement—inspired by what his mother had sold at her restaurant in Japan. The eponymous brand he launched grew into a major success—with sales of $25 million before the U.S. distribution rights were acquired in 2000 for $24 million by the American food giant Heinz (now Kraft Heinz). And then a business that had commanded 26% of America’s total teriyaki sales slowly got killed over the past two decades. But Yoshida didn’t let that end his story. His repurchase of Mr. Yoshida’s was the most significant food buyback of 2024—and the early success of its return to Costco, Sam’s Club, Safeway and Albertsons, as well as its first-ever launch on Amazon, has paved the way for Mr. Yoshida’s to regain its position as a major player in the condiments industry. WHY IT MATTERS “Heinz destroyed Yoshida’s brand,” Yoshida says with the same grin featured on his labels. “I wanted to start over again.” MORE The Secret Sauce Behind This $350 Million Japanese Barbecue Sauce?

The TikTok ban could be catastrophic for Americans. This crisis has ripple effects that could disrupt industries and shake the American economy. 💰 Aly (my editor) HATES when I do hot takes… but billions per month are at stake, and American small businesses are on the line so I have to share this one. Also: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning Thousands of creators are scrambling to find alternative platforms, and millions who built their livelihoods on TikTok are at risk of losing their incomes. This ban threatens TikTok employees, creators, influencers, and small businesses throughout the entire ecosystem. This ban could also be a massive stumbling block for a major tech company. And it's not who you think. 😮 I'll drop some insights on what this chaos might mean for long-term Meta investors. (Not financial advice.) Low key, this TikTok ban is like a soap opera. 🍿 That said, these views are my own, definitely not ZDNET's, and definitely not Aly's. If you're new to my work, my name is Lester Mapp. My friends call me Les. 👋 I'm a founder with a successful exit and currently the executive chairman of a group of DTC brands. But at my core, I'm an award-winning performance marketer. Also: ChatGPT Search could destroy online businesses - how you can stay ahead I've crafted and managed tens of millions in digital marketing campaigns on Meta, TikTok, and Google. 🚀 Needless to say, I have unique insight into what's happening and how this ban will affect small businesses. BTW, if you're into data-driven marketing insights and strategies, check out my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts. All that said, let's get into the hot take Aly told me not to do. 😅 The TikTok ban is officially called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and was signed into law by President Biden on April 24, 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, now has a deadline to sell the app to a US-approved buyer or face a ban. 😤 Here is the recap: Deadline: ByteDance must sell TikTok by January 24, 2025 (or April 24, 2025, with an extension). Consequence: If not sold, TikTok will be removed from US app stores and banned. Reason: The law addresses national security concerns over data access and potential influence from the Chinese government. TikTok saw the new act and said nah and pushed back against it, arguing it violates the First Amendment. The irony of a Chinese company arguing for the First Amendment is not lost on me. 🙃 On December 6, 2024, the US Court of Appeals upheld the ban. In response, TikTok said nah again and plans to appeal to the Supreme Court and seek an injunction to delay the ban. As of December 13, 2024, the Supreme Court has yet to rule, leaving the outcome uncertain. In addition, TikTok creators are suing the Department of Justice, arguing that the ban threatens their livelihoods, communities, and freedom of expression. 😱 TikTok has become a critical platform for many creators, with some earning over 75% of their income through the app. 😳 Meta doesn't offer the same programs and support geared toward audience growth and creator revenue, so creators on Meta typically earn less money. Also: Want analytics for your Threads posts? Meta is testing the feature now For advertisers, the TikTok ban is less than ideal; in fact, it sucks. To understand why, here's a crash course in marketing. Don't worry, I'll keep it as simple as possible. There are two main stages of awareness: Intent: When people know what they want and are actively searching for it. This is called product or problem awareness. I know what my problem is, and I'm looking for a solution. Sometimes, this could be problem and solution-aware. Think of when you use Google Shopping. It doesn't get any easier than this for an advertiser because I don't need to educate you… you buy, or you leave. Very straightforward. Discovery: Picture this: you're scrolling on Meta or TikTok, enjoying the funny stuff on your feed, and boom, you see a very cool widget for a problem you have. With a bit of education, you decide to buy. That's discovery. Discovery is key to scaling revenue because it introduces your product or service to people who don't yet know they need it. Meta is king when it comes to discovery, but TikTok is gaining ground quickly. Stay with me; you need to understand this to see the void… ⏳ TikTok provides another platform to showcase products to a new audience at scale. While it isn't quite at Meta's level yet, it is getting there. Also: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today Since TikTok is so effective, running campaigns on both TikTok and Meta together increases overall marketing efficiency for advertisers. What's also never mentioned is that TikTok's rapid growth forces Meta to step up its game for creators and advertisers. Without TikTok, I worry Meta will fall back into old habits, ad costs will keep rising, and ad efficiency will drop. 🥺 The obvious winners are platforms like Google, Meta, Snapchat, and X. 🏆 Google is sighing relief as 74% of Gen Z users use TikTok for search, with 51% preferring TikTok over Google as their search engine. Yeah, you read that right; on top of being a social platform, TikTok is also becoming a search engine. Amazon also stands to benefit. TikTok Shop has been growing rapidly, and its ability to serve as both a traffic source and a storefront makes it incredibly powerful. Also: Drowning in spam? Stop giving out your email address - do this instead Overall, I believe this ban will be a net positive for the American people. I know what you are thinking: "You just said this will cost small businesses billions, plus lead to lost jobs and more." And I feel strongly about that. However, no foreign adversary should have this much access to American lives. This data includes spending habits, credit card information, shopping preferences, location data, browsing history, biometric data, and even access to camera rolls and microphones. 🔒 Looking at this objectively, we should have never gotten to this point. But that is a rant for another day. ByteDance, creators, and small businesses would bear the brunt of a TikTok ban as court filings from TikTok executives estimate creators and small businesses could lose $1.3 billion in revenue during the first month. 📉 But guess who's probably low-key pissed about this? Shopify! Shopify's partnership with TikTok allows merchants to connect their Shopify stores directly to TikTok Shop. It allows business owners to sync their stores, manage ads, access analytics, and use TikTok's shopping features. This seamless integration drives growth for both platforms. 🤝 TikTok's e-commerce goals are ambitious, with a target of $17.5 billion in US sales for 2024. Shopify stands to gain big from that. The partnership gives merchants access to TikTok's massive audience and a new way to drive sales. TikTok and Shopify are like peanut butter and jelly. One brings the traffic, and the other handles the transactions. All I am saying is that Shopify is about to take a hit, and no one is talking about it. 🤔 If you are a creator or small business owner wondering what to do next, I got you. The obvious answer is to double down on platforms like YouTube, Meta, X, and others. It's decent advice, but more is needed to solve the real problem. The real issue is that we need to own our audience as marketers, business owners, and creators. Whether through email lists, membership sites, or SMS, the goal should be to own the relationship, not rent it. Here's the hard truth: if it's not this, it will be something else. The next update, the next algorithm change, the next platform shutdown, something will always disrupt the way you reach your audience. I've been doing this for a long time, and I can't recall a moment when advertising costs went down. Owning your audience is more than just prudent. It's an opportunity to stabilize costs. The pattern is clear for 2025: businesses must be media-first to survive and thrive. 📢 What does that mean? Think about building a community. Think about providing value to your prospects before making an offer. It's about creating content that builds trust, loyalty, and engagement so your audience stays with you, no matter what happens on any platform. If you want deeper insights on how to make this work, hit me up on LinkedIn. As someone who this ban will impact, I have a mixed bag of emotions. 🥴 As a TikTok Shop operator and advertiser, I wanna cry. As a Meta advertiser, I'm not happy and will be closely watching ad costs as this plays out. As a Meta investor, I find it interesting that it could boost the share price. As a Shopify investor, I'm closely monitoring Q2 2025 earnings if the ban is upheld. As an American, I like my privacy private, so I get it. That said, in situations like this, I always remember this quote… "It's not happening to you. It's happening for you." 🤗 As cheesy as it sounds, that saying has served me well during tough times. 😇 Hope this helps; I'm rooting for you. P.S. 📩 Want more data-driven marketing insights?

Title: 2025 tech job market statistics and outlook
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Tech-job-market-statistics-and-outlook
Time Published: 2024-12-13T11:55:00Z

Olivier Le Moal - stock.adobe.co Once booming, the tech market has been unsteady since the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent layoffs at major tech giants, such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta. Add in the exponential growth of AI and automation, and it's no surprise the tech job market has been roiled over the past few years. As technology advances and companies attempt to keep pace amid constant volatility, it begs the question: Will the uncertainty of the tech job market -- slow job growth, continuous layoffs and skill shortages -- continue into 2025? Here are some statistics that clarify the tech job market in 2025. Tech jobs in the U.S. are projected to grow much faster than average, according to the Computing Technology Industry Association's (CompTIA) 2024 "State of the Tech Workforce" report. The report projected tech job growth from 6 million in 2024 to 7.1 million in 2034. According to research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, computer and IT occupations are expected to grow much faster than average from 2023 to 2033, with a projected 356,700 job openings annually. By 2026, the IT skills shortage will become a significant problem for most organizations globally, resulting in $5.5 trillion in losses, according to an IDC survey of North American IT leaders. Organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry predicted the skills shortage might leave as many as 85 million unfilled tech-related jobs by 2030. The IT skills shortage may already be here. No longer a looming issue, AI and other technologies continue to advance faster than workers and organizations can react. Staffing firm Robert Half reported that 95% of tech leaders who responded to its survey currently face challenges finding skilled workers. The Linux Foundation reported that a growing number of organizations, in response to technological advances and a tough labor market, are investing internally to close skill gaps rather than hiring new talent or consultants. Organizations continue to prioritize upskilling, reskilling and cross-skilling to meet their needs. After all, the half-life of technology skills is as short as 2.5 years, according to Harvard Business Review. The World Economic Forum, back in October 2020, noted that more than half of workers require skilling of some type by 2025 due to rapid technology advancements. According to Indeed's "Tapping Into Today's Tech Talent" report from October 2024, Python is the most in-demand skill in job listings, followed by experience with AWS, which enjoyed the largest growth in demand in the last year, as well as Oracle, Java and JavaScript. PyTorch, Rust, TensorFlow, Flutter and Dart were listed as other fast-growing areas. Xamarin, Erlang, Azure and iOS faced the biggest declines in demand, according to the report, with Erlang among the list of dying programming languages. Skillsoft's "2024-25 IT Skills and Salary Report" stated the average worldwide salary for IT professionals has increased nearly 5% since last year. North America recorded the highest average salary of $113,211 in comparison to three other regions: Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA; and Asia-Pacific. C-level IT executives earned the highest salaries, according to the report, followed by IT architecture and design, and then cloud computing. In North America, the highest salaries are in the IT software sector. Meanwhile, IT professionals in the education sector reported the lowest average salary. LinkedIn's November 2023 "Future of Work Report: AI at Work" highlighted the ever-increasing demand for AI skills as organizations integrate AI into their business practices. Other hiring platforms concur. Indeed's Hiring Lab reported a 30-fold increase in generative AI-related jobs from January 2023 to February 2024, though they still make up a relatively small part of total jobs. That is changing as organizations focus on AI skills entering 2025. A ResumeTemplates.com survey found that 87% of leaders who plan to hire list AI experience as valuable for job seekers. Plus, AI skills benefit current employees. For example, in its 2025 salary guide, Robert Half reported that 44% of organizations boost pay for workers with AI and machine learning skills. CBRE, a commercial real estate services and investment firm, found tech industry hiring is slowing. Nontech industries hire more tech talent than tech industries, a first in the CBRE "Scoring Tech Talent" report's 11-year history. While the tech industry added nearly 29,000 tech talent jobs in 2023, the report noted professional and business services, excluding tech, netted almost 50,000 jobs, followed by roughly 45,000 in the transportation, warehousing and wholesale sectors. Layoffs, rampant in the tech industry since the pandemic, aren't stopping. TrueUp's layoff tracker reported more than 1,000 rounds of layoffs in 2024, affecting nearly 700 people per day. Continuous layoffs parallel an uptick in unemployment for tech workers. According to CompTIA's "Tech Jobs Report", in June 2024, unemployment for IT professionals reached 3.7%, the highest mark since August 2020. To combat hiring challenges, organizations are deprioritizing experience to help find and hire tech talent faster, according to Robert Half's 2025 salary guide. Additionally, the salary guide found technology leaders are taking other measures to attract top candidates, including 45% of leaders who've decided to increase pay.

Title: Watch These Broadcom Price Levels as Stock Soars on Strong AI Sales Growth

Broadcom (AVGO) shares surged in extended trading Thursday after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected earnings and issued a rosy outlook amid robust AI-driven sales growth. The company said its fiscal 2024 AI revenue more than tripled, driven by its AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. After-hours gains accelerated after CEO Hock Tan told analysts on the company’s earnings call that he anticipates significant AI opportunities over the next three years, adding that he sees accelerators and networking sales in fiscal 2027 ranging between $60 billion and $90 billion. Through Thursday's close, Broadcom shares had gained 64% since the start of the year. The stock rose 14% to around $206 in extended trading. Below, we break down the technicals on Broadcom’s weekly chart and identify key price levels worth watching out for. Broadcom shares have consolidated within an ascending triangle since mid June, a chart pattern that signals a continuation of the stock’s longer-term uptrend. Indeed, the price sits poised to break out above the formation’s top trendline on Friday, setting the stage for further upside. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) gives a reading just above 50, confirming bullish momentum and indicating the shares have ample room to test higher prices as they move into price discovery. Let’s apply technical analysis to forecast a potential upside price target and also identify two key support levels that would likely attract buying interest during retracements. To forecast an upside target in the stock, investors can use the bars pattern tool, which analyzes prior trends to help predict future directional moves. When applying the tool to Broadcom's chart, we extract the stock’s trend higher from December 2023 to June this year and reposition it from the ascending triangle’s top trendline. This projects a longer-term upside target of around $315. We selected this prior move as it commenced following a decisive earnings-driven jump above a continuation pattern on the chart in December last year, similar price action to what looks likely after the company’s latest quarterly report. During pullbacks, investors should initially watch how the price reacts to the $185 level. This location on the chart would likely attract buying interest near the ascending triangle’s top trendline, which may flip from an area of prior resistance into future support. Selling below this level could see Broadcom shares revisit lower support around $140, an area where investors may seek buying opportunities near a horizontal line that connects a series of comparable trading activity on the chart between February and September.

SEBI comments on retail participation in algo trading SEBI to review, refine framework on algorithmic trading by retail SEBI: Broker to provide algo trading after exchange permission Sensex and Nifty rebound: Market recovers despite broad-based volatility The Sensex and Nifty fully recovered today after the steep intraday fall, reflecting broad-based volatility across the market. Overvaluation concerns relative to global peers, coupled with disappointing corporate earnings, have further spurred FII outflows. On Thursday, FIIs sold Rs.3,560.01 worth of equities which marks the continuation of the profit booking. The Indian rupee touched an all-time low against the US dollar on Thursday, driven by persistent foreign investor-led sell-offs in equities and a rise in onshore forward premiums, contributing to significant downward pressure on the currency. The trend aligns with global factors such as the strength of the US dollar, supported by robust U.S. economic data and recent election outcomes. Domestically, inflation remains a key worry. India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation came at 5.5% in November, within the RBI’s target. But, constant elevated food prices, raise concerns about potential delays in interest rate cuts by the RBI. All these factors collectively contribute to heightened market volatility, leading to inconsistent intraday trends with sudden fluctuations, which have made it difficult for traders to predict market movements and generate intraday profits.

Cathie Wood's ARK ETFs published their daily trades for Thursday, December 12th, 2024, showcasing a mix of strategic buy and sell decisions across various sectors. The most significant move from the day was the purchase of 5,080,595 shares of Archer Aviation Inc (NYSE:ACHR), with ARK's flagship ARKK ETF acquiring the bulk at 4,705,518 shares, followed by 288,154 shares through ARKQ ETF, and 86,923 shares via ARKX (NYSE:ARKX) ETF, amounting to a total dollar value of $37,545,596. On the selling front, ARK chose to offload shares of several companies, including a notable sale of 36,600 shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), spread across ARKK ETF with 34,823 shares and ARKQ ETF with 1,777 shares, totaling a value of $15,546,581. This continues ARK's recent trend of reducing its position in the electric vehicle giant, following a larger sale of 51,335 TSLA shares just two days prior. Another significant sale was of Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB), with ARKX ETF parting with 4,100 shares for a value of $95,735. This follows a substantial sell-off of 205,897 RKLB shares on Wednesday, signaling a potential shift in ARK's investment strategy regarding the aerospace manufacturer. ARK also engaged in smaller transactions, buying 28,823 shares of Symbotic Inc (NASDAQ:SYM) through its ARKQ ETF for a total of $768,997, and 56,338 shares of Tempus AI Inc (NYSE:TEM) across its ARKK and ARKG ETFs, totaling $2,433,238. The continued accumulation of TEMPUS AI INC stock is evident, with ARK having bought significant amounts consistently over the previous trading days. In addition, ARK sold 2,479 shares of Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:NYSE:VEEV) through its ARKG ETF, amounting to $579,714. This is part of a pattern of selling VEEV shares, with 4,660 shares sold earlier in the week. Investors following Cathie Wood's ARK ETFs will note the continued focus on innovative and disruptive companies, with adjustments to holdings reflecting ARK's active management approach and response to market dynamics.

Most every Saturday morning, Bob Snow slips on a short sleeve fishing shirt and khakis and ­putters out to his garage, a former airplane hangar within sight of the historic Rivanna River. “Thomas Jefferson used to cross right over there,” the Troy, Va., resident says, pointing across a wide field to a distant bank. Snow is 83. His white hair is close-cropped, and his smile is constant. He hums a lot. You’d be hard-pressed to find a more unlikely hardcore prepper anywhere in America. But inside the hangar, which serves as the warehouse for an organization called East Coast Preppers, Snow’s obsession becomes clear. Sturdy metal shelves fill its 7,000 square feet. They’re stocked floor to ceiling with backpacks, skillets, latex gloves, and binoculars. Freeze-dried celery, blueberries, oranges, and mango. Powdered eggs, powdered peanut butter. Portable showers and commodes. And everything is for sale. An anomaly? Hardly. Harsh pandemic realities brought doomsday into the daylight and put a sudden stamp of social approval on prepping. Today, it’s believed some 23 million adults in the United States are stockpiling their pantries and upping their survival skills. It’s big business, too, with billions spent annually on portable generators, gas masks, and windup radios. Some preppers are motivated by pragmatism and common sense, but others do a 180 into apocalyptic fear, fueled by a consuming zeal to protect themselves and their families. Christians are not immune from the hype. Depending on their eschatology, some foresee a coming calamity. Others question the desire to preserve what we have on earth when something much better awaits. By 10 o’clock at Snow’s place, more than 20 customers arrive with emptied car trunks ready for bulk buys. They’ve signed up for a class, too. This morning, it’s “Advanced Prepping.” Men and women, mostly over age 60, plop down in plastic lawn chairs set up in a room where three large dehydrator machines stand against one wall. As the crowd samples a salad made with freeze-dried chicken, a photo of then-President Joe Biden grins from a nearby dartboard. A sign on the wall says, “We now accept cash, gold, and silver.” Snow, standing at the front, starts the class by holding up a copy of One Second After, a popular novel about an unexpected electromagnetic pulse attack, or EMP. In the book, every modern electrical device is disabled, and the United States is effectively returned to the 19th century. Some in the crowd have read it. Others want to. They run the gamut, these preppers, from a grandma on her way to a soccer game, to a country singer hopeful on his way to Nashville. But they all seem to see eye to eye about one thing—­disaster is coming, and it’s high time to prepare. One woman, who only gives me her first name, Joyce, confides that she has a “room of doom” at her house. She keeps it supplied with canned goods, candles, whatever it would take to get through a long-term emergency. “I’ve been doing this for decades,” she admits sheepishly, going on to extol the virtues of rain barrels. In the back row, Jack, another cautious type who won’t give out his last name, says he’s unhappy with the country’s direction. That’s why he never misses one of these free weekend classes. He’s even taught his 10-year-old son how to sanitize water. But that’s nothing compared with a lady to his left. She quips that she recently cashed in her 401(k) and put it in precious metals. The surprising thing? No one within earshot even bats an eye. Bob Snow (right) and Gary Woodson take stock of the inventory at the East Coast Preppers warehouse. Photo by Kim Henderson TODAY’S PREPPER MOVEMENT traces its heritage to the Cold War of the 1950s, when the threat of atomic attack had schools conducting “duck and cover” drills, and families built bomb shelters in their backyards. During the Eisenhower administration, authorities even urged families to maintain a seven-day supply of food and water. They named the initiative “Grandma’s Pantry,” stressing that grandmas are always ready for emergencies. In the early ’60s, President John F. Kennedy upped the ante by calling for more than $200 million to construct public fallout shelters. The Department of Agriculture got busy, too. The result was a contribution to the doomsday diet—a bulgur wheat biscuit dubbed the “All-Purpose Survival Cracker.” Over the next decades, terms like retreater and survivalist entered the vocabulary. A survivalist honed pioneer skills and anticipated a combative style of preparedness. A retreater, in contrast, tried to avoid conflict and become invisible. As interest in survivalism grew during the 1980s, books and expos for its adherents became a multibillion-­dollar industry. Prepping took a hit when the scare over Y2K turned out to be false, but it wasn’t long before the terrorist attacks of 9/11 prompted authorities to instruct citizens to stockpile duct tape and have an evacuation plan. Hurricane Katrina, which left thousands of people without access to resources and supplies, furthered the cause. That was 2005. Five years later, polls showed half of all Americans had preparedness on the brain—a nearly 20% increase from pre-Katrina years. During that time period, Bob Snow was newly retired and spending time in Utah. As a Mormon, he was already steeped in preparedness. It’s part of a religious ideology that exalts being “anxiously engaged in a positive program of preparation.” In Utah, Snow saw the Mormon network of home storage centers and canneries. He visited prepper stores with their heirloom seed and water filtration systems. He determined his community back home in Virginia needed something similar. With his wife’s blessing, Snow cashed in a $30,000 life insurance policy and hauled two tractor trailers filled with survival goods across the country. East Coast Preppers was born. Shoppers in the warehouse today probably don’t know that history. No clues of a Latter-day Saints connection mark the aisles they’re cruising. Class is over, and some participants are looking for the new MadiDrop that Snow promoted. It’s a ceramic tablet that can treat up to 20 liters of water a day for 12 months, a utility he described as “revolutionary.” Snow is seated behind a table where his laptop is open and acting as a cash register. Business is steady. A regular he knows by name rolls up with three full shopping carts. In a matter of minutes, she shells out more than $1,000 for “supplies.” Prepping isn’t cheap. Americans spent an estimated $11 billion on emergency preparedness in 2022, and not just on the basics. They bought things like steel shelters, too. Texas builder Rising S Bunkers, which incorporates three crosses into its logo, is one of the best known in the business. Its 8-by-12 bunker starts at $50,900. A decontamination room costs $29,000 extra. Now that prepping is no longer shorthand for paranoia, big names like Walmart, Amazon, and Costco are jockeying for a share of the market, too. Costco’s one-month emergency food supply buckets are available by the pallet for $6,000, but you can’t accuse them of price gouging. That’s almost 14,000 just-add-water meals for less than 50 cents each. Pastor Tim Kinnard on his homestead in Sherwood, Ark., with a wood supply for the winter. Photo by Kim Henderson IN EARLIER TIMES, preparedness was a necessity, but prepping today is as much personal philosophy as emergency management. That personal philosophy usually includes strong views about self-sustainability, the kind that are in line with environmentalists on matters like rainwater harvesting and alternative energy. Preppers are also into gardening and canning, pursuits popular with millennials. But the prepper movement rarely gets linked to either of those groups. Instead, stereotypical preppers are considered too right wing and conservative, and they feel strongly about gun ownership. Or at least we think they do. There’s a secretive element that makes preppers hard to categorize and even harder to count. But since the pandemic, traffic to prepper websites and online communities has exploded, with some YouTube prepper channels boasting more than a million subscribers. Of course, the more sensational the episode titles—“You Have Been Warned,” “Get Your Money Out Now,” “We Won’t Survive This”—the more monetized the content creator. That’s where fear-mongering festers, and prepping becomes an identity instead of an activity. Although some Christian preppers embrace that apocalyptic vision, others forgo the fear. They just want to be prepared to help themselves—and others—when tough times come. Pastor Tim Kinnard lives just north of Little Rock, Ark., a state where the climate and cost of living, as well as less government regulation, have attracted an influx of preppers. One day a stranger knocked on his door. “He said they were moving from a more liberal context, a trend I’ve heard called the ‘Blue State Exodus,’” Kinnard recalls. “He wanted my advice on a good place to settle.” The man knew Kinnard from his online lectures and podcasts related to homesteading. That label—homesteader—is one Kinnard is more comfortable wearing than prepper, though his family is more prepared than most. His wife grows medicinal herbs, and his five children help raise pigs. Snap beans are ready in the garden. Their home, a Dutch Colonial, is extra-insulated and designed for good ventilation. Kinnard says their lifestyle is more about self-­reliance than stockpiling. A collected, rather than calamitous, approach. “Common, everyday preparedness is a wise thing, but what we know as ‘doomsday prepping’ isn’t Biblical unless what we mean by that is we’re preparing to meet the Lord Himself, and we are preparing others to be ready to meet the Lord, too,” Kinnard reasons. “That’s my pushback to the stockpiling-to-survive-the-end-of-the-world flavor of prepping, which many Christians are into.” And while Kinnard expresses dismay at preppers profiting from Armageddon announcements, he says he doesn’t trust the mainstream media to tell him everything that’s happening either. Instead, he tunes in on his ham radio and subscribes to specific podcasts and YouTube channels to hear reports from everyday people. “Whatever narrative you hear on the news isn’t necessarily what’s really going on,” Kinnard says. “So having free agents out there doing the same thing, telling us what’s really going on, we need that. But the motivation needs to be the facts, not ‘here’s a spin of those facts so I can get a couple extra dollars.’” Mark and Krista Lawley are part of the prepping set Kinnard considers non-alarmist. Since 2020, they’ve aired more than 470 episodes of their “Practical Prepping” podcast, all produced inside their North Alabama home recording studio. Some of their most popular include: “Items Preppers Should Carry Every Day,” “Eight Uses for Hydrogen Peroxide,” and “What Moms Need To Know About Home Invasions.” The Lawleys started their podcast after a trip to the grocery store during COVID-19. For the first time in her life, 62-year-old Krista was standing in front of empty store shelves. “I thought to myself, ‘This is Russia. We’ve got the money to spend and nothing to buy with it,’” she remembers. Both she and Mark have long believed in keeping their pantry full and their tools handy. His understanding grew while he was involved with the Birmingham Metro Baptist Association’s disaster relief team. During some of its missions, he saw tornado victims desperate for food. Many had only a few days’ worth on hand. “And the younger they are, the less they prepare,” Krista interjects, shaking her head. She says dependence on DoorDash and Instacart has trained a generation to think only of today. “These people don’t even have a can of soda in their refrigerator.” Each episode of the Lawleys’ podcast begins with a promise: no bunkers, no zombies, no alien invasions. They point out that a lot of people are prepping for postapocalyptic, total-grid-down societal collapse. Not them. “We don’t want to survive that,” Mark clarifies, a hint of a smile hiding behind his mustache. He adds that much depends on your eschatology. “Some Christian preppers think that the Church is going to go through the tribulation, but I believe the rapture is going to occur before the tribulation. What we prepare for are the practical things that happen to everyday people.” Pastor Tim Kinnard with herbs from the family garden.

Mark and Krista are members of a local faith-based prepping group born of a Sunday school class discussion. Members meet monthly and share their skills. Medical practitioners, lawyers, farmers, weapons experts, cattlemen. Some property owners simply offer space. “If disaster strikes and you need to get out of your urban setting, because it’s probably the most dangerous place you could be, they are offering a safe haven,” Krista explains. In contrast, she admits some preppers strive to lie low. They fear the world will beat a path to their door after a disaster and take what they’ve painstakingly stored. Krista is not for that attitude. “I think the Christian perspective is, we’re here for others.” When the Lawleys launched a private “Practical Prepping” Facebook group in January, it attracted nearly 25,000 members in just a few months. Although they enlisted help to moderate posts, they still spend about an hour each day responding to questions from fellow preppers around the world. Some countries have government-backed preparedness initiatives. In Sweden, prepping is viewed as a form of social responsibility, rather than an eccentric hobby. Students are taught essential survival skills and the importance of self-sufficiency. That’s been Bob Snow’s mission with East Coast Preppers for nearly two decades. At his age, though, tall shelves are hard to stock, and heavy equipment is a pain to unload. In May, he announced his retirement. His email to the East Coast Preppers community was short and to the point: He’s tired. But a paragraph near the end provided an additional tidbit. Until their warehouse doors close for good, weekly sales will continue to soar. Meanwhile, there’s an urgency in Snow’s voice as he tells his Saturday crowd that something significant happened the day before. The price of gold rose $60 an ounce. Then, almost as quickly, it went back down. He’s right. It was a record high at the time. But for a hundred years gold prices have fluctuated for all sorts of reasons—inflation, rising geopolitical tension, the amount of reserves, the cost of mining—with large swings in both directions. Still, Snow sees the recent spike as a sign of something worse coming. He definitely has the crowd’s attention, and he’s very convincing. “That just doesn’t happen,” he declares in an understated way, his eyes widening at the thought. “It was a red flag to me.” If you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism, click here.
