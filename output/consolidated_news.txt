Amazon is preparing to lay off as many as 30,000 corporate employees starting Tuesday, according to sources cited by Reuters. The move is part of a broader effort to cut costs and address overhiring that occurred during the pandemic's surge in demand. While the cuts represent a small fraction of Amazon's total workforce of 1.55 million, they account for nearly 10% of the company's approximately 350,000 corporate staffers—and amount to the largest round of layoffs since 2022, when about 27,000 jobs were cut. Per a source who spoke to CNBC, this round of cuts will be the biggest ever for the company's corporate employees. The layoffs are expected to span multiple divisions, including human resources, devices, services, and operations. Managers in affected areas were reportedly given training on Monday to prepare for informing staff, with official notifications set to begin Tuesday morning. CEO Andy Jassy has been pushing to streamline company operations, reduce management layers, and cut back on what he describes as excessive bureaucracy. Amazon has introduced an anonymous complaint system to identify inefficiencies, resulting in hundreds of process changes. Jassy has previously indicated that increased use of artificial intelligence is likely to drive further job reductions, as automation replaces repetitive tasks. The exact number of layoffs could change as Amazon's financial priorities evolve, but reports suggest that the human resources division alone may see cuts of around 15%. Despite the reductions, Amazon is still planning to hire 250,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period, matching previous years.

Amazon is preparing to lay off 30,000 corporate employees. The cuts impact nearly 10% of its corporate workforce across key divisions. This is the largest single layoff under CEO Andy Jassy's leadership. The company cites cost-cutting and the integration of AI as primary drivers. This follows a previous round of 27,000 job cuts in 2022 and 2023. The cuts impact nearly 10% of its corporate workforce across key divisions.

This follows a previous round of 27,000 job cuts in 2022 and 2023. In a move that sends a chilling message about the future of the white-collar worker, Amazon is preparing to swing the axe on a staggering 30,000 corporate employees. The job cuts, set to begin Tuesday, represent a nearly 10 percent reduction of the companyâs 350,000-person corporate workforce and mark the largest single layoff since the tech giant eliminated 27,000 positions beginning in late 2022. This decision, driven by a push for cost-cutting and the integration of artificial intelligence, highlights a disturbing trend where corporate efficiency is prioritized over the livelihoods of thousands. According to reports from Reuters, the layoffs will ripple across multiple divisions. The corporate bloodletting is expected to affect human resources, known internally as the People Experience and Technology or PXT group, as well as operations, devices and services, and the vital Amazon Web Services cloud unit. This strategic shift underscores a fundamental restructuring of how the corporate behemoth operates, moving away from human labor and toward automated systems. The scale of this layoff is unprecedented for Amazon under CEO Andy Jassyâs leadership. Since taking the helm from founder Jeff Bezos, Jassy has overseen a relentless campaign to trim what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy. This latest cut of 30,000 jobs, however, dwarfs previous efforts and signals a new, aggressive phase in the companyâs operational philosophy, one that appears to view a significant portion of its corporate staff as expendable. A pattern of corporate contraction This is not an isolated event but part of a concerning pattern. The planned 30,000 job cuts follow the 27,000 positions eliminated in 2022 and 2023. This repeated contraction suggests a company in a perpetual state of flux, one that rapidly expanded during the pandemic only to just as rapidly discard the very employees who helped manage that growth. The human cost of this corporate strategy is immense, creating widespread uncertainty and instability. At the heart of this workforce reduction is a relentless drive to reduce costs and reverse what the company calls "pandemic-era overhiring." Yet, this justification rings hollow to those who remember the massive profits Amazon reaped during the same period. The company now seeks a "stronger cost structure," a corporate euphemism that often translates to shattered careers and broken families for those on the receiving end of a pink slip. The role of artificial intelligence in these layoffs cannot be overstated. Jassy himself has been a vocal proponent of AI, acknowledging that its increased use would lead to job cuts by automating repetitive and routine tasks. In a June communication, he warned employees to embrace automation or risk being left behind. He wrote that those who âbecome conversant in AIâ would be best positioned to âhelp us reinvent the company.â This creates a troubling ultimatum for workers: adapt to the technology that may replace your colleagues or become obsolete yourself. Efficiency comes with a human cost Managers of impacted teams were instructed to undergo special training on Monday to learn how to communicate the bad news to their staff. Email notifications are scheduled to start going out on Tuesday morning, a cold and impersonal method for delivering life-altering news. The process reduces human beings to mere data points in a cost-saving algorithm, stripping away the dignity of work and loyalty. Further adding to the callous nature of these cuts are reports regarding Amazonâs stringent return-to-office policy. The policy, among the strictest in the tech industry, was reportedly intended to generate employee attrition. When that failed to produce enough voluntary departures, the company allegedly told some remote employees they had "voluntarily quit" and could leave without severance, a blatant maneuver to save money at the direct expense of workers. While Amazon pares back its corporate roles, it simultaneously announced plans to hire 250,000 seasonal workers for the holiday rush. This dichotomy reveals a corporate priority for flexible, temporary labor over stable, long-term careers. It paints a picture of a future workforce where permanent positions are scarce and job security is a relic of the past. As artificial intelligence and automation become central to corporate strategy, the very definition of work and the value of the worker are being radically redefined, and not necessarily for the better. The pursuit of profit and efficiency, it seems, has a very human price.

Title: Amazon prepares for major layoffs among office workers, media reports say
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m3zm9jnl1o

Amazon has confirmed it plans to cut thousands of jobs, saying it needs to be "organised more leanly" to seize the opportunity provided by artificial intelligence (AI). The tech giant said on Tuesday it would reduce its global corporate workforce by "approximately 14,000 roles". Earlier reporting had suggested it was planning to lay off as many as 30,000 workers. Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon, wrote in a note to staff that the move would make the company "even stronger" by shifting resources "to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs". She acknowledged that some would question the move given the company was performing well. At the end of July, Amazon reported second quarter results which beat Wall Street expectations on several counts, including a 13% year over year increase in sales to $167.7bn (£125bn). But Ms Galetti said the cuts were needed because AI was "the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet" and was "enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before." "We're convicted that we need to be organised more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business," she added. The note, shared with Amazon employees earlier on Tuesday, said the company was "working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted" - including by helping those affected find new roles within Amazon. Those who cannot will receive "transition support" including severance pay, it said. The BBC has asked if it will affect employees in the UK. The company has more than 1.5 million employees across its warehouses and offices worldwide. This includes around 350,000 corporate workers, which include those in executive, managerial and sales roles, according to figures that Amazon submitted to the US government last year. Like many technology firms, Amazon hired aggressively during the Covid-19 pandemic to meet the surge in demand for online deliveries and digital services. Amazon boss Andy Jassy has since focused on reducing spending as the company invests heavily in AI tools to boost efficiency. Mr Jassy said in June that the increase in AI tools will likely lead to job cuts as machines take over routine tasks. "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs," he said then. Amazon has carried out several rounds of cuts to its corporate division in recent years. It laid off around 27,000 workers over several months in 2022, as rivals similarly looked to reverse hiring increases made during the pandemic. After the company posted its latest financial results in July, its more subdued profit guidance for the forthcoming quarter left some sceptical of whether - or when - its enormous AI investments would pay off. Slower growth for its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), compared to rivals Microsoft and Google, also sparked concern among some investors. Amazon will report its latest results on Thursday for the period ending 30 September. Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said the wider industry would be watching Amazon closely as it embarked on its latest round of cuts. "We are already seeing jobs in software development be shed thanks to the capabilities of some of these AI tools, and the big companies will be looking to redistribute and restructure their workforces accordingly," he told the BBC. "They have the data and can apply AI in a way that unfortunately means job losses are inevitable."

Amazon's latest cuts fed into anxiety about AI replacing workers. But some are sceptical that recent layoffs are a telling sign of how AI is affecting employment.

Share this article BlackRock’s IBIT took in around $65 million in Bitcoin on Monday, marking another significant institutional investment in the leading cryptocurrency through the asset management giant’s services. BlackRock has been actively facilitating institutional access to Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds, enabling both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to digital assets via established financial products. The purchase reflects sustained Wall Street interest in Bitcoin during periods of price consolidation. Recent market discussions suggest such institutional accumulation by traditional finance players demonstrates growing confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value. Asset managers like BlackRock continue enabling broader institutional entry into Bitcoin, with these large-scale purchases potentially signaling support for renewed upward momentum in the cryptocurrency market.

Title: Trump administration narrows list of potential Federal Reserve chairs to 5
URL: https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/trump-administration-narrows-list-potential-federal-reserve-chairs-126915784
Time Published: 2025-10-28T02:37:56Z
Full Content:
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed the names of five candidates to replace Jerome Powell as chair of the powerful Federal Reserve next year WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed the names of five candidates to replace Jerome Powell as chair of the powerful Federal Reserve next year. On an Air Force One flight to Asia with President Donald Trump, Bessent said he would engage in a second round of interviews in the coming weeks and present a “good slate” of candidates to Trump “right after Thanksgiving.” Trump said he expected to decide on Powell's replacement by the end of this year. The five people under consideration are: Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman; former Fed governor Kevin Warsh; White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett; and Rick Rieder, senior managing director at asset manager BlackRock. The names suggest that no matter who is picked, there will likely be big changes coming to the Federal Reserve next year. Bessent, who is leading the search for Powell's replacement, last month published extensive criticisms of the Fed and some of the policies it has pursued from the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009 to the pandemic. Trump on Monday, meanwhile, repeated his long-standing attacks on Powell, charging that he has been too slow to cut interest rates. “We have a person that’s not at all smart right now," Trump said, referring to Powell. “He should have been much lower, much sooner.” The Fed is expected to lower its key rate Wednesday for the second time this year. Trump's goal of selecting a new chair by the end of this year could reflect some of the tricky elements surrounding Powell's status. His term as chair ends next May, but he could remain on the Fed's board as one of seven governors until January 2028, an unusual but not entirely unprecedented step. Such a move would deprive Trump of an opportunity to nominate another governor for several years. Still, current governor Stephen Miran was appointed by Trump Sept. 16 to finish an unexpired term that ends next Jan. 31. Trump could nominate his candidate to replace Powell for that seat, and then elevate that person to chair in May after Powell steps down. Hassett is currently the chair of the National Economic Council at the White House and was also a top Trump adviser in the president's first term, and a frequent defender of the administration's policies on television. His longtime loyalty to the president could give him an edge, some Fed watchers say. Warsh is a former economic advisor in the George W. Bush administration and was appointed to the Fed's governing board in 2006 at age 35, making him the youngest Fed governor in history. He left the board in 2011. Warsh is now a fellow at the Hoover Institution and a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Waller was appointed to the Fed by Trump in 2020, and quickly established himself as an independent voice. He began pushing for rate cuts in July and dissented at that meeting in favor of a quarter-point cut, when the Fed decided to leave its key rate unchanged. But he voted to reduce rates just a quarter-point in September, along with 10 other Fed officials, while Miran dissented in favor of a half-point. Michelle Bowman is the Fed's vice chair of supervision, making her the nation's top banking regulator. She was appointed by Trump in 2018, and before that was Kansas' state bank commissioner. Bowman also dissented in favor a rate cut in July, then voted with her colleagues last month for a quarter-point reduction. Rieder has the most financial markets experience of any of the candidates and has worked for Wall Street firms since 1987. Rieder joined BlackRock in 2009. His focus is in fixed income and he oversees the management of roughly $2.4 trillion in assets. Bessent has set out a wide-ranging critique of the Fed while interviewing for Powell's replacement. In particular, he has criticized the central bank for continuing unconventional policies, such as purchasing Treasury bonds in order to lower longer-term interest rates, long after after such steps were justified, in his view, by emergency conditions. “It is essential the Fed commit to scaling back its distortionary impact on markets," Bessent wrote. “It also likely requires an honest, independent, and nonpartisan review of the entire institution and all of its activities.” Bessent's criticisms aren't entirely new, but they have gained greater traction in the wake of the 2021-22 inflation surge. The Fed is mandated by Congress to seek stable prices as well as maximum employment. Bessent's critiques have also inevitably been tangled up with Trump's insistent calls for lower interest rates, which have threatened the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics. Trump has also taken the unprecedented step of trying to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee, to open another seat on the board for him to fill.

Title: Amazon To Slash Up To 30,000 Corporate Jobs, Largest Cut Since 2022: Reuters

Amazon is reportedly planning a massive reduction in its non-warehouse staff, targeting as many as 30,000 corporate jobs starting this week, as the e-commerce giant works to pare expenses and correct for pandemic-era overhiring, according to three sources familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters. This significant workforce contraction, which would be the largest layoff at Amazon since approximately 27,000 roles were eliminated starting in late 2022, represents nearly 10% of the company's approximately 350,000 corporate employees. The job cuts are expected to begin with email notifications being sent out on Tuesday morning, following preparatory training given to impacted team managers on Monday, Reuters reported. The core drivers for the reduction are two-fold, an aggressive effort to cut costs company-wide amid a tougher economic environment and to compensate for the major staffing boost that occurred during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic when demand for online commerce surged. The scale of this reduction highlights a continued trend of efficiency drives across the tech sector. Sources indicated to Reuters that the cuts may impact a wide array of divisions, including human resources, known internally as People Experience and Technology, as well as the devices and services and operations groups. This latest downsizing aligns directly with chief executive officer Andy Jassy’s strategic initiative to reduce what he has characterised as an "excess of bureaucracy" within the massive organization, including a focus on managerial layers. Jassy has also publicly suggested that the company's increased reliance on Artificial Intelligence tools would likely result in further job eliminations by automating many repetitive and routine tasks, a shift that analysts suggest is a major underlying factor in such substantial corporate staff reductions. This move, one of the largest single rounds of tech industry layoffs in recent years, underscores the company's commitment to prioritising efficiency over sheer headcount. Despite the deep corporate cuts, Amazon appears to be expecting a strong holiday season. The company still plans to offer 250,000 seasonal jobs to staff its warehouses, matching its seasonal hiring figure from the past two years. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the matter, Reuters noted. The report surfaces just before the company is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Thursday.

Title: Amazon Layoffs: E-commerce giant plans biggest job cuts since 2022 — over 30,000 corporate roles at risk, says report

Amazon is reportedly preparing to eliminate up to 30,000 corporate positions starting Tuesday, 28 October, marking its largest workforce reduction since 2022, according to a Reuters report citing individuals familiar with the matter. This would mark Amazon's largest job cut since late 2022, when it started to eliminate around 27,000 positions. The move is part of Amazon’s broader cost-cutting strategy as it seeks to streamline operations and recalibrate after the Covid-19 pandemic-era over-hiring, when surging online demand prompted aggressive expansion across divisions. While the planned redundancies account for only a fraction of Amazon’s 1.55 million global workforce, they represent nearly 10% of its 3,50,000 corporate employees. The cuts underscore a shift in focus from rapid growth to sustained profitability, as the e-commerce giant navigates a more cautious economic climate and slower consumer spending trends. Amazon last executed major layoffs in late 2022, eliminating approximately 27,000 roles across its business units. Earlier this month, Fortune reported that Amazon is preparing to cut as much as 15% of its human resources staff, with additional layoffs likely in other divisions. Amazon’s human resources division—known internally as PXT or the People eXperience Technology team—will be hard-hit, but other areas of its core consumer business are also likely to be affected. Amazon has declined to comment publicly on the planned layoffs despite multiple media requests. According to Reuters, the company directed managers of affected teams to undergo communication training on Monday in preparation for staff notifications, which are expected to begin via email on Tuesday morning. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy already oversaw the largest layoffs in the company's history from late 2022 into 2023, when the company cut at least 27,000 corporate jobs, which accounted for a high-single-digit percentage of the company’s office jobs. Many other Big Tech companies also slashed their headcounts around that time as the pandemic receded and consumer demand trends changed. Now, many employers are looking to harness the power of AI—initially for mundane and repetitive tasks and eventually for more complicated jobs—to reduce the need to maintain the same level of human staff on their payrolls. Andy Jassy himself is one of those employers. The CEO fired a warning to his employees in June, when he encouraged them to welcome this new AI-powered era. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote in a companywide email, also published on Amazon’s corporate blog. At the same time, Jassy also said there won’t be room on the bus for everyone: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Since succeeding Jeff Bezos as CEO in 2021, Jassy has built a reputation as a cost-cutter and operational reformer. Amazon managers are routinely required to meet targets for ‘unregretted attrition’ (URA), a measure indicating the percentage of staff the company can afford to lose through voluntary departures, managed exits, or layoffs. However, people familiar with developments told Fortune that the latest wave of cuts is being treated differently within the company, signalling a broader restructuring effort rather than a routine trimming of underperforming staff.

Title: Report: Amazon to let go of up to 30,000 employees, starting this week
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/27/report-amazon-let-go-30000-employees-starting-week/

UPDATED 20:08 EDT / OCTOBER 27 2025 by Mike Wheatley Amazon.com Inc. is reportedly planning to let go up to 30,000 employees in what would be its largest ever round of layoffs. Some workers could be let go as early as Tuesday, as the company makes its latest in a series of moves aimed at cutting down costs and conserving cash. A report by Reuters cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter as saying that the job cuts would represent about 10% of Amazon’s global corporate workforce, though not all of them will happen this week. However, it’s expected that thousands of notices will go out to employees this week. The layoffs are set to affect virtually every part of Amazon’s enormous organization, including its human resources department, cloud computing and advertising teams, and a number of other business units. The company hasn’t yet finalized the total number of reductions, according to one anonymous source. The layoffs come at a time when many American companies are looking for ways to reduce their operating costs or at least slow their head count growth, due to rising prices, a tight labor market and the on-again, off-again prospect of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. In the case of Amazon, Chief Executive Andy Jassy (pictured) has been striving to cut costs for years, partly to compensate for the company’s massive investments in artificial intelligence, which requires the construction of enormous data centers. The online retail giant has laid off about 27,000 employees since 2022. According to Reuters, Amazon views the cuts as part of an ongoing effort to correct its aggressive hiring during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. During that time, there was a significant boom in online shopping that resulted in Amazon doubling its warehouse network in less than two years, creating thousands of new blue- and white-collor positions. Jassy has also been looking for ways to do more with less, notably by using artificial intelligence systems to automate work that was previously performed by humans. In June, he became one of the first high profile CEOs in the U.S. to admit that AI will likely eliminate the need for many jobs, and predicted that Amazon will replace humans in thousands of roles in the coming years. He called generative AI a “once-in-a-lifetime technological change” and noted that it’s already affecting the way it runs its business. “​​As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” he said at the time. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce.” Earlier this month, Amazon lifted the lid on a new, AI-powered robotic warehouse system called Blue Jay that’s able to automate tasks such as scanning and sorting packages. It’s believed that the system will allow the company to build smaller warehouses closer to consumers in urban areas, where it hasn’t been able to operate so far. In addition, the company is also experimenting with AI tools that can predict shopper’s needs and make recommendations for their next purchases. Constellation Research Inc. analyst Holger Mueller said Amazon is still trying to adjust its business following its all-out hiring spree during the height of the pandemic. He believes the company is trying to balance the layoffs with the roll out of new automated systems and processes powered by robotics and AI, so as to avoid too much disruption to its business. But doing so is challenging because there’s no real precedent for such maneuvering. “These layoffs are different because it seems they’re going to be applied across all functions within Amazon, but on the flip side it suggests Andy Jassy believes that all parts of its business can be automated with new technologies,” Mueller said. “However, he needs to be careful to time the layoffs and the roll out of its process improvements, because he cannot allow dips in business performance. Amazon’s razor thin retail margins make the timing of the shift to machine decisions very tricky.” Another problem Amazon has to contend with its the growing perception that it’s struggling in AI, with recent comments from analysts voicing concerns that it appears to be lagging behind competitors such as Google Cloud and Microsoft Corp. In July, Amazon reported a sharp increase in profit and sales for its second quarter, but its cloud computing business failed to match the growth of its rivals’ and its stock declined. At the time, AllianceBernstein LP analysts said in a note that the results posed “uncomfortable questions” for the company about whether it’s an “AI winner or a laggard.” Despite this, Amazon has continued to throw billions of dollars at its AI investments. It reported $31.4 billion in capital expenditure during the second quarter, and explained that most of this was related to building out cloud computing infrastructure for AI. The company said at the time that the number was “representative” of its planned spending for the remainder of the year. Amazon is expected to report its third-quarter financial results after the bell on Thursday, Oct. 30, when we’ll likely learn more about the planned layoffs.

The impacted staffers will start receiving email notifications Tuesday morning, according to the report. Amazon did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. These job cuts would follow a series of cuts that began in late 2022 and eventually totaled about 27,000 layoffs, according to the Reuters report. The new cuts would amount to nearly 10% of Amazon’s corporate employees, who number about 350,000, but only a small percentage of the company’s total workforce of 1.55 million, the report said.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in September 2024 that the company planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and to “operate like the world’s largest startup.” “If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy wrote at the time in a message shared with Amazon employees and shared online. When Amazon began its earlier series of layoffs in November 2022, Jassy said the company had hired rapidly over the previous several years and was looking at workforce levels. In other news, Amazon said Monday that it plans to invest more than €1.4 billion in the Netherlands over the next three years to support both Amazon Web Services and the company’s retail business. The company has served customers in the Netherlands for five years and now has more than 4,500 of the country’s small and medium-sized businesses selling on its platform, according to a Monday press release.

Title: Trump administration narrows list of potential Federal Reserve chairs to 5

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed the names of five candidates to replace Jerome Powell as chair of the powerful Federal Reserve next year. On an Air Force One flight to Asia with President Donald Trump, Bessent said he would engage in a second round of interviews in the coming weeks and present a “good slate” of candidates to Trump “right after Thanksgiving.” Trump said he expected to decide on Powell’s replacement by the end of this year. The five people under consideration are: Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman; former Fed governor Kevin Warsh; White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett; and Rick Rieder, senior managing director at asset manager BlackRock. The names suggest that no matter who is picked, there will likely be big changes coming to the Federal Reserve next year. Bessent, who is leading the search for Powell’s replacement, last month published extensive criticisms of the Fed and some of the policies it has pursued from the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009 to the pandemic. Trump on Monday, meanwhile, repeated his long-standing attacks on Powell, charging that he has been too slow to cut interest rates. “We have a person that’s not at all smart right now,” Trump said, referring to Powell. “He should have been much lower, much sooner.” The Fed is expected to lower its key rate Wednesday for the second time this year. Trump’s goal of selecting a new chair by the end of this year could reflect some of the tricky elements surrounding Powell’s status. His term as chair ends next May, but he could remain on the Fed’s board as one of seven governors until January 2028, an unusual but not entirely unprecedented step. Such a move would deprive Trump of an opportunity to nominate another governor for several years. Still, current governor Stephen Miran was appointed by Trump Sept. 16 to finish an unexpired term that ends next Jan. 31. Trump could nominate his candidate to replace Powell for that seat, and then elevate that person to chair in May after Powell steps down. Hassett is currently the chair of the National Economic Council at the White House and was also a top Trump adviser in the president’s first term, and a frequent defender of the administration’s policies on television. His longtime loyalty to the president could give him an edge, some Fed watchers say. Warsh is a former economic advisor in the George W. Bush administration and was appointed to the Fed’s governing board in 2006 at age 35, making him the youngest Fed governor in history. He left the board in 2011. Warsh is now a fellow at the Hoover Institution and a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Waller was appointed to the Fed by Trump in 2020, and quickly established himself as an independent voice. He began pushing for rate cuts in July and dissented at that meeting in favor of a quarter-point cut, when the Fed decided to leave its key rate unchanged. But he voted to reduce rates just a quarter-point in September, along with 10 other Fed officials, while Miran dissented in favor of a half-point. Michelle Bowman is the Fed’s vice chair of supervision, making her the nation’s top banking regulator. She was appointed by Trump in 2018, and before that was Kansas’ state bank commissioner. Bowman also dissented in favor a rate cut in July, then voted with her colleagues last month for a quarter-point reduction. Rieder has the most financial markets experience of any of the candidates and has worked for Wall Street firms since 1987. Rieder joined BlackRock in 2009. His focus is in fixed income and he oversees the management of roughly $2.4 trillion in assets. Bessent has set out a wide-ranging critique of the Fed while interviewing for Powell’s replacement. In particular, he has criticized the central bank for continuing unconventional policies, such as purchasing Treasury bonds in order to lower longer-term interest rates, long after after such steps were justified, in his view, by emergency conditions. “It is essential the Fed commit to scaling back its distortionary impact on markets,” Bessent wrote. “It also likely requires an honest, independent, and nonpartisan review of the entire institution and all of its activities.” Bessent’s criticisms aren’t entirely new, but they have gained greater traction in the wake of the 2021-22 inflation surge. The Fed is mandated by Congress to seek stable prices as well as maximum employment. Bessent’s critiques have also inevitably been tangled up with Trump’s insistent calls for lower interest rates, which have threatened the Fed’s independence from day-to-day politics. Trump has also taken the unprecedented step of trying to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee, to open another seat on the board for him to fill. Cook has sued to keep her seat and the Supreme Court has allowed Cook to remain on the board while it considers the case. Trump’s attacks on the central bank have left some longtime Fed critics skeptical of the Trump administration’s approach. Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian and professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, cautioned against placing “loyalists” on the Fed “who are there to push the president’s narrative.” “Those are the ones that we want as his advisers and spokespeople and his lawyers, not his central bankers,” he said.

Title: Amazon to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs, reports say | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Amazon plans to lay off as many as 30,000 corporate employees, beginning tomorrow, reports say. The cuts would total nearly 10% of the company’s corporate jobs, as advances in artificial intelligence stoke fears about the white-collar workforce and the US labor market shows signs of weakening. Reuters was the first to report the job cuts. CNN has reached out to Amazon for comment. Amazon has over 350,000 corporate employees, according to a 2024 survey filed to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a blog post to employees that efficiency gains from artificial intelligence would allow the company to eventually have a reduced human workforce. It’s not the first round of massive layoffs for the tech giant. In 2023, the company cut 27,000 workers in its human resources department, Amazon Stores, Amazon Web Services and other divisions. At the time, Jassy attributed the job cuts to a worsening global economic outlook. The cuts come as the US job market has showed warning signs for months, especially for young tech workers. There have been widespread concerns that generative AI could eventually replace many human workers as companies cut costs through greater automation. However, AI experts say a lot of these fears aren’t backed by substantial research. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Amazon Poised to Lay Off Up To 30,000 Employees Tomorrow

Multiple reports now say that Amazon will lay off up to 30,000 employees as soon as tomorrow, though some layoffs could extend into early 2026. The coming Amazon layoffs were first reported by Reuters, but The New York Times has since independently confirmed the story. Both reports cite multiple sources. And both claim that Amazon is trying to cut billions in expenses and pare down a workforce that ballooned during the 2020 pandemic. Amazon is unique among its Big Tech peers in that it employs far more people because of its massive logistics and warehouse operations, both of which are largely unrelated to technology. It employed over 1.5 million people as of the end of 2024, but only 350,000 or so are considered corporate employees. So the 30,000 figure, if accurate, would be nearly 10 percent of that latter workforce. And the largest single layoff in Amazon’s history. It previously eliminated about 27,000 positions in late 2022 and early 2023. According to Reuters, managers were required to undergo training today to handle tomorrow’s layoffs, and notifications will begin going out via email starting Tuesday morning. The layoffs won’t include Amazon’s annual seasonal hiring binge, with Reuters claiming that the firm will offer 250,000 temporary jobs to help staff warehouses during the coming holiday season. Amazon will report its latest quarterly earnings on Thursday. The company is expected to spend about $120 billion in the current fiscal year on capital expenses tied to its AI datacenter buildout, a gain of 50 percent over the previous year.

Title: Amazon to Chop 30,000 Corporate Jobs This Week, Its Largest Layoffs Ever
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/amazon-corporate-layoffs-largest-ever/
Time Published: 2025-10-27T21:44:44Z

Human resources, devices and services and operations are expected to be the most-impacted branches Amazon is preparing to cut as many as 30,000 jobs this week its latest effort to lower expenses. The move, according to Reuters, will impact the company’s corporate arm, with human resources, devices and services and operations receiving the most cuts. Expected to begin rolling out Tuesday, the proposed 30,000 eliminated roles will mark Amazon’s largest-ever round of cuts, surpassing the 27,000 jobs exited in 2022. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reportedly has plans to eliminate an overabundance of managers and beurocracy build-up at the company. He also said back in June that more use of AI going forward would likely lead to other cuts at the company. Amazon did not respond to TheWrap’s request for comment. Layoffs continue to wrack the tech and entertainment industry. Paramount will slash roughly 1,000 jobs on Wednesday in its first round of major cuts under new CEO David Ellison, with additional cuts expected at a later date, according to Bloomberg. The total cuts are expected to impact around 2,000 employees. The latest round of layoffs at the media giant come as new owner Skydance looks to exceed $2 billion in cost savings. In August, Paramount president Jeff Shell warned that the layoffs would be “painful,” but emphasized that the media giant doesn’t want to “cut its way to growth.” And elsewhere in the media world, NBC News eliminated its teams dedicated to covering issues affecting Black, Asian American, Latino and LGBTQ+ groups as part of its layoffs of about 150 staffers. The cuts mean that the verticals NBC BLK, NBC Asian America, NBC Latino and NBC OUT no longer have dedicated teams bolstering their coverage. Tech companies Microsoft, Meta and Intel also saw major layoffs this year, with the latter totaling 22,000 jobs cut so far.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon is planning thousands of job cuts across its corporate workforce, and managers have been warned to prepare for an announcement this week, according to people familiar with the matter, an internal document, and internal messages seen by Business Insider. The move is expected to be announced on Tuesday, and will impact employees in the US, the UK, and Canada, according to recent internal messages sent to Amazon managers. A draft email that's due to go out to impacted employees noted that Amazon is eliminating jobs "after a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward." The draft document also described a severance package that includes full pay and benefits for the next 90 days. Business Insider viewed a copy of this draft email, along with copies of the internal messages to Amazon managers. Various teams within Amazon, including human resources and retail, will be affected, the people familiar said. Thousand of employees will likely be eliminated, these people added, while asking not to be identified discussing sensitive topics. An Amazon spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment. Reuters reported the cuts this week could impact as many as 30,000 employees. That would represent roughly 10% of Amazon's corporate workforce. CEO Andy Jassy has been overhauling the tech giant this year, reseting a hardcore culture that existed when Amazon was a smaller, scrappier company. He's slashed layers of management, attacked bureaucracy, enforced strict cost discipline, updated performance metrics and pay structures, and sent most corporate employees back to the office five days a week. That followed a post-pandemic period when Amazon responded to a dramatic growth slowdown. The company scaled back unprofitable projects and trimmed a bloated workforce. Amazon doubled its workforce to 1.6 million from 2019 to 2021, but that number dipped to 1.55 million last year. Amazon has already cut at least 27,000 employees since late 2022. In June, Jassy told employees that efficiency gains from AI would reduce the company's workforce. Amazon also froze the hiring budget for its big retail business earlier this year. And the cloud business, Amazon Web Services, saw layoffs in July. Reuters said the job cuts would affect Amazon's HR and devices teams. Fortune previously reported that Amazon could cut up to 15% of its HR staff. Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at ekim@businessinsider.com or Signal, Telegram, or WhatsApp at 650-942-3061.

By Jennifer Maas TV Business Writer Amazon is set to lay off tens of thousands of its corporate employees this week, marking the company’s biggest staffing reduction since roughly 27,000 staffers were eliminated at the end of 2022. As first reported by Reuters, the Andy Jassy-led ecommerce giant will cut as many as 30,000 workers — nearly 10% of its corporate workforce — beginning as early as Tuesday. The layoffs come just before Amazon reports its latest quarterly earnings results on Thursday and are, according to Reuters’ sources, part of efforts to “pare expenses and compensate for overhiring during the peak demand of the pandemic.” Related Stories Mohamed Jabaly's 'My Sister Gaza,' Alexandru Solomon's 'Small Expectations' Among 51 Projects Selected for IDFA Forum How Czech Filmmaker Hana Novakova Became 'Obsessed' With the Moose After Its 'Unbelievable' Return to Her Homeland As of the end of March, Amazon reported 1.56 million employees, up 3% from a year earlier. According to Reuters, the corporate staff count is approximately 350,000. Popular on Variety Representatives for Amazon did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment Monday. Back in June, Amazon CEO Jassy sent a memo to staff that outlined how generative AI would soon “make our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today” but also cut the overall number of jobs at the company. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” the CEO said. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Amazon to cut up to 30,000 corporate jobs as cost pressures mount amid post-pandemic overexpansion: Report

Amazon is preparing to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs starting Tuesday, Reuters reported, citing three people familiar with the matter. The move is part of an effort to rein in costs after what the company now views as overexpansion during the pandemic boom. The planned layoffs represent nearly 10 percent of Amazon’s roughly 350,000 corporate employees, though only a fraction of its 1.55 million global workforce. If finalized, it would mark the company’s largest round of job reductions since approximately 27,000 roles were eliminated beginning in late 2022. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment, according to Reuters. The cuts are expected to hit various divisions across the company. Roles at People Experience and Technology (human resources), devices and services, and operations are among those in the firing line, depending on shifting financial priorities, the report said. Amazon has already trimmed smaller numbers of positions across devices, communications, podcasting and other teams over the past two years. Managers in impacted business units participated in training on Monday to prepare for notification emails scheduled to go out Tuesday morning, according to the report. CEO Andy Jassy has launched a push to eliminate what he has called “excess bureaucracy,” including reducing layers of management. He has set up an anonymous internal system to flag inefficiencies, which has generated about 1,500 submissions and more than 450 process changes so far. Jassy said earlier this year that increased use of AI tools would likely result in further workforce reductions by automating repetitive tasks. The final scale of layoffs may evolve as Amazon’s financial strategy continues to adjust, the sources told Reuters. Amazon shares rose 1.3% to $227.11 near Monday’s close. The ecommerce and cloud giant is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Amazon Plans Massive Layoffs After Nine Months of President Trump
URL: https://newrepublic.com/post/202322/amazon-layoffs
Time Published: 2025-10-27T21:08:09Z
Full Content:
Online retail giant Amazon plans to slash as many as 30,000 corporate jobs Tuesday, which would be the biggest number of layoffs at the company in three years. Reuters reports that the cuts would amount to 10 percent of the company’s close to 350,000 corporate employees, and would be across different departments. The last time Amazon cut this many jobs was 2022, when 27,000 were slashed late in the year. The move follows Amazon CEO Andy Jassy saying in June that AI tools would lead to job cuts. It’s not a good indicator for the economy under President Trump. The website Layoffs.fyi, which tracks job cuts, estimates that 98,344 technology employees have been laid off this year from 216 companies. The site also estimates that 71,981 government employees have been laid off by Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, out of a total of 182,528 federal employees departing from the jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ jobs report last month showed unemployment at a four-year high, with only 22,000 jobs added in August (compared to a forecast of 75,000). Thanks to the government shutdown, job and unemployment figures from September aren’t known, but they are likely pretty bad. ADP, which processes payrolls, reported earlier this month that the private sector lost 32,000 jobs in September. While the shutdown hides an official tally of how bad employment numbers are in America right now, Amazon’s impending layoffs, and estimates from other sources, indicate that the economy isn’t very strong right now—and the buck stops with the president. California will send election observers to counter the “election monitors” that Trump plans on sending to multiple deep blue districts in the state ahead of next week’s special election. “They’re not going to be allowed to interfere in ways that the law prohibits,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Monday. “We cannot be naïve. The Republican Party asked for the U.S. DOJ to come in.” “[Trump] is laying the groundwork. He is socializing an idea that is very dangerous,” Bonta added, noting that Trump still claims to have won the 2020 presidential election. “All indications, all arrows show that this is a tee up for something more dangerous in the 2026 midterms—and maybe beyond.” Trump’s Justice Department last week announced it would send federal election monitors to several blue districts in California and New Jersey. In California, the Trump administration is likely well aware of Proposition 50, a ballot measure that would redraw the state’s congressional districts to help Democrats gain more seats in the U.S. House. Trump’s DOJ monitoring a crucial election in California is a recipe for basic voting rights to be blatantly violated. Governor Gavin Newsom on Friday called it a “deliberate attempt to scare off voters and undermine a fair election.” “They have no business doing that. They have no basis to do that,” he said in a video posted on X. “We have a statewide election for a statewide constitution. This is about voter intimidation, this is about voter suppression. Period, full stop.” Donald Trump's puppet DOJ has no business screwing around with next month's election.Sending the feds into California polling places is a deliberate attempt to scare off voters and undermine a fair election.We will not back down. Californians decide our future — no one else. pic.twitter.com/olGXV5GBjL The Irish have had enough of Donald Trump. McCormack’s Irish Pub in Richmond, Virginia, made waves earlier this month when its owner, William “Mac” McCormack, released some hot merchandise: a load of “Fuck Trump” black T-shirts, retailing for $11 a pop. The shirts proudly display the pub’s logo: an antifascist emblem superimposed over a shamrock. A printed phrase circles around the icon, reading: “Fuck ICE, Fuck Nazis, Fuck Trump,” according to McCormack’s Facebook. But the top did not resonate with those on the ideological right, who consumed the comment section before spilling over to the pub’s review pages on Yelp and Google. Some commenters scorned the pub’s self-advertised ideology as “disgusting,” deriding the shirts as a stunt that would “alienate half of [McCormack’s] clientele.” One Yelp user, who goes by Marge and lives nearly 3,000 miles away in San Francisco, wrote that the service was “terrible” and the “food is almost as bad.” “Save your time and money. This place sucks. Not a true Irish Pub,” the account wrote, leaving a one-star review on Saturday. “Liberals who think we care where they stand politically.” But any regular would know that the shirt—and its message—are nothing unusual for McCormack’s. “I was just making T-shirts that align with most of my customers, with the pub’s beliefs,” McCormack told RVA Magazine. The shirt is really nothing new. There’s always been some variation of the shirt, according to its owner. “It used to just say, ‘Fuck Nazis.’ We just clarified who the Nazis were,” McCormack said. McCormack’s is one of Richmond’s oldest dive bars. The successful institution has since expanded into two whiskey restaurants—McCormack’s Big Whisky Grill and McCormack’s Whisky Grill—but the original establishment has been proud to be punk since the 1990s, according to RVA. “I’ve never hidden my politics there,” McCormack told the publication. “It’s bigger than just the bar, it’s what you believe. And it’s what I believe one hundred percent.” Despite the backlash, there’s nothing illegal about voicing dissent against the government. Protesting the government is a protected right under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as established by the Founding Fathers. Comparing MAGA politics to Nazi Germany, McCormack told RVA that small-business owners should stick by their principles. “I don’t think we should be silent,” he said. Voicing his disdain for the current administration has actually turned out to be a positive business decision for McCormack, who told RVA that the shirts have since sold out and that “all three locations have been busier than normal.” New customers, attracted by the firm political stance, are going out of their way to share a drink at McCormack’s. Some Facebook users said they would travel from as far as New Jersey to grab a pint at the bar if it meant supporting the cause. McCormack’s advice to other small-business owners: “Don’t be scared to have an opinion.” “You don’t have to do it like I did,” McCormack told RVA. “You can be more subtle, but if we don’t speak up then we’re just the same as those people in Germany who still live with three generations of regret.” Indiana Governor Mike Braun is pushing President Donald Trump’s gerrymandering scheme forward in the Hoosier State—but Republicans still aren’t getting on the bandwagon. Braun announced Monday that he was calling a special legislative session to vote on new congressional districts, ensuring Republicans maintain control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. “I am calling a special legislative session to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair,” he wrote in a statement. But Molly Sigart, spokesperson for Rodric Bray, the Indiana Senate’s president pro tempore, told The New Republic Monday that the votes “still aren’t there for redistricting.” The 50-member Senate has only 10 Democrat members, meaning that more than a dozen of the remaining members also opposed the plan. Last week, Bray’s office said that the Republican plan lacked the necessary support, raising red flags for Braun’s redistricting efforts. Meanwhile, Braun’s spokesperson claimed the governor was “confident” that he could secure a majority of state Senate Republicans’ support. Braun initially floated the idea last month of calling legislators back and warned that there would be “consequences” for not keeping pace with the White House’s requests for redistricting, which have already been passed in Texas, Missouri, and most recently, North Carolina. The special session Braun called Monday, which will occur before lawmakers are set to return in January, will likely cost taxpayers a pretty penny. In Indiana, things have gotten heated. Both Trump and Vice President JD Vance have personally connected with state Republicans about supporting a new congressional map. Last month, Indiana state Senator Jim Banks suggested that podcaster Charlie Kirk’s death was reason enough to do it. “They killed Charlie Kirk—the least that we can do is go through a legal process and redistrict Indiana into a nine to zero map,” Banks said. Indiana state Senator Liz Brown, an assistant majority floor leader, published a statement supporting the move Monday. “Redistricting isn’t a technical exercise. It’s power drawn on a map. And Democrats have been wielding it for decades,” wrote Brown on X. “Conservative voices have been thwarted for far too long by liberal states like Massachusetts who refuse to create competitive congressional districts.” “Gov. Braun’s decision to call our legislature into session to address redistricting is welcome news,” she wrote. Exxon is trying to claim that California’s climate laws infringe on its freedom of speech. The oil company filed a lawsuit against the state Friday over two laws, passed in 2023, that require companies doing business in California to disclose carbon emissions and climate-related financial risks, with penalties if they don’t comply. Exxon claims that the laws, known as the California Climate Accountability Package, would force the company to “serve as a mouthpiece for ideas with which it disagrees.” A spokesperson for California Governor Gavin Newsom, Tara Gallegos, told The New York Times, seemingly tongue in cheek, that it was “truly shocking that one of the biggest polluters on the planet would be opposed to transparency.” The laws, which will be enforced beginning next year, “have already been upheld in court and we continue to have confidence in them,” Gallegos added. Exxon said in the lawsuit that it already reports its carbon emissions and climate risks voluntarily but that the state laws would force it to change its framework to one it finds “misleading and counterproductive.” Right now, Exxon uses a methodology to calculate its emissions developed by an oil and gas industry group, but would have to change to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, developed by the research group World Resources Institute and business network World Business Council for Sustainable Development. The company claims this framework would send “the counterproductive message that large companies are uniquely responsible for climate change no matter how efficiently they satisfy societal demand for energy, goods, and services.” Exxon additionally argues that the legal requirement to report its global emissions should only be focused on the company’s emissions in the state. Exxon is also fighting against a provision in one law that requires companies to disclose how climate change threatens their business operations and what they plan to do about it. Exxon claims the law requires speculation “about unknowable future developments” and conflicts with securities laws. There is another pending lawsuit against the laws from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the California Chamber of Commerce, and the American Farm Bureau Federation, with a trial expected next year. The oil company is trying to dodge transparency about its operations, perhaps concerned about how bad these disclosures would make it look. It may also be hoping for the law to be struck down by conservative judges, or even the Supreme Court. President Trump is loudly dismissive of climate change and the threats it poses, and may take further action against California on his own. Ontario Premier Doug Ford thinks that the Ronald Reagan anti-tariff commercial that set President Trump off was “the best ad I ever ran.” The TV ad featured an edited 1987 radio address from President Reagan, in which he stated that tariffs only serve to “hurt every American.” Trump was so bothered by the ad using someone he likes to compare himself to against him that he started another trade war with Canada, announcing an additional 10 percent tariff on its products over the weekend. “Canada was caught, red handed, putting up a fraudulent advertisement on Ronald Reagan’s Speech on Tariffs,” Trump posted to Truth Social to justify the tariff hike. “The Reagan Foundation said that they, ‘created an ad campaign using selective audio and video of President Ronald Reagan. The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address,’ and ‘did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal options in this matter.’” But the premier of Ontario, which produced the ad in the first place, isn’t bothered. “You know why President Trump is so upset right now? It was because it was effective,” Ford said on Monday. “The only people that win in a tariff war are the people around the world that don’t necessarily see eye to eye with us and with the United States.” Ford says the ad has received over “a billion impressions around the world.” This shared animosity underscores the schisms that Trump’s retaliatory tariffs have caused with some of America’s closest allies. “We can’t control the trade policy of the United States. We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the policy in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, and it’s a situation where the United States has tariffs against every one of their trading partners,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters last Friday, when Trump first began fuming about the ad. “What we can control, absolutely, is how we build here at home.… What we can also control, or at least heavily influence, is developing new partnerships and opportunities, including with the economic giants of Asia, which is the focus of this trip.” Health care access could soon become a pipe dream for some Wisconsinites if Congress doesn’t muster up a budget. The government shut down 27 days ago, in large part over a debate on the merits of the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, which assist individuals making upward of 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Still, neither national political party appears willing to shatter Congress’s stalemate on how to fund Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget, which included details to slice billions from Obamacare subsidies and Medicaid. Open enrollment for the subsidized coverage is just days away, but failing to extend the premium tax credits could raise premiums by thousands of dollars a year for people within the affected income bracket all over the country. In Wisconsin, those hardest hit could see their premiums rise by more than $30,000 per year, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers warned Monday. Age and residency also factor into eligibility for the credits. In Barron County, a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 could see their premiums rise by 800 percent to an annual increase of more than $33,000. Roughly 32 percent of Barron County is above the age of 60, while 73 percent of the population makes less than $100,000 per year, according to 2020 census data. In a statement, Evers argued that the ongoing congressional failure will make “healthcare coverage costs skyrocket.” “Republicans’ reckless decisions are causing prices on everything to go up, from groceries to gas—Wisconsinites cannot afford to pay even more for healthcare, too,” Evers said. “Republicans need to end this chaos and stop working to make healthcare more expensive. It’s that simple.” But Wisconsin is far from the only state expected to suffer. As of last week, more than a dozen states had opened up their Obamacare marketplace for a window-shopping period, including California, Georgia, Kentucky, Nevada, Maryland, and Maine. Individuals in those states could similarly see prices rise by thousands of dollars annually. Idaho, which has roughly 135,000 enrollees on the marketplace, opened its Affordable Care Act marketplace portal Thursday with a slew of new price tags, offering the nation a glimpse into federal health care services sans federal support. More than 6 percent of the state population, roughly 13,000 people, stand to lose the premium tax credits. The mystery donor who wrote President Donald Trump a $130 million check for the military is believed to be 83-year-old conservative billionaire Tim Mellon. Two people familiar with the conversations identified Mellon to The New York Times, which published the development Saturday. Mellon inherited his fortune from his grandfather, banking magnate and former Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, and he has become a major player in conservative politics in his own right over the past decade. Mellon donated a whopping $150 million to Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, surpassed only by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, according to Open Secrets. The day after Trump was convicted of 34 felony charges that same year, Mellon donated $50 million to Trump’s super PAC, one of the single largest disclosed contributions ever. With this latest donation, it’s clearer than ever that Trump’s White House has been bought and paid for by the billionaire class. But this particular payment will hardly make a dent. Split among the military’s 1.3 million service members, the donation will come out to about $100 per person. Last week, Trump announced that his administration had received a $130 million donation, and the Department of Defense confirmed that the government had accepted the money in order to “offset the cost of Service members’ salaries and benefits” under the “general gift acceptance authority.” On Friday, Trump declined to say who the donor was, only saying he was “a great American citizen” and a “substantial man” who would “prefer that his name not be mentioned.” Budget experts argued that the donation violated the Antideficiency Act, which puts barriers on the use of funds and personnel during an appropriations lapse, prohibiting the use of funds not allocated by Congress. Legal experts pointed out that Trump was already going out on a limb legally by repurposing other DOD funding to keep service members paid. A federal agent blatantly violated a court order against using excessive force against journalists and protesters last Thursday by pointing a gun in a veteran’s face, saying “Bang, bang” and “You’re dead, liberal.” The Chicago Headline Club, a nonprofit representing journalists in the Chicago area, filed a complaint in federal court after the incident, which took place in the city’s Little Village neighborhood. Local residents had gathered to observe and protest a large presence of federal agents in the area, and Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino did not respond well or care to take the earlier court order into consideration. According to the complaint, combat veteran Chris Gentry was “lawfully standing on the side of the road voicing his opposition as agents were driving by in their vehicles.” That’s when an agent pointed a gun at him and threatened to kill him. That was just one of many shocking incidents that day. Bovino also allegedly threw a tear gas canister into a crowd of protesters, who, according to the complaint, were not violent or committing any crimes. Some of the protesters attempted to talk to Bovino and other federal agents there and were rebuffed. Bovino and his colleagues instead shoved several people and threw more tear gas canisters at them, according to the complaint. The Department of Homeland Security claimed in a social media post that protesters “shot at agents with commercial artillery shell fireworks” and that they attacked federal agents first, which the complaint calls a lie. Further, the complaint quotes protesters who say that the crowd in Little Village was peaceful. Bovino claimed to a reporter at the scene Thursday that he was hit with a rock, but did not appear to be injured. Federal Judge Sara Ellis has ordered Bovino to appear in court Tuesday to testify about Thursday’s incidents, as well as sit for a five-hour deposition on November 5. Judging by Bovino and his fellow federal agents’ actions on Thursday, court orders and legal action don’t appear to be a deterrent. Other federal agents nationwide, particularly those working for ICE, have made violent arrests and lied about them, even dragging a four-foot-six blind man outside of a Portland detention facility and dropping him on his head earlier this month. The fatal flaw in the criminal cases against Donald Trump: credibility. Ex-special prosecutor Jack Smith’s legal team was expecting to file the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case in the nation’s capital. But in an attempt to play the case by the book, Smith surprised them by opting to file in Florida instead, where the case would have a one in six chance of landing in Judge Aileen Cannon’s courtroom, reported The Washington Post’s Carol Leonnig and Aaron C. Davis in their book, Injustice. “Are you all fucking insane?” David Raskin, a federal prosecutor who had worked on the case, blurted out in a Justice Department hallway at the time, according to the Post. Smith believed then that filing in Florida could place the case on firmer legal footing, reducing the possibility that the most egregious charges could be overturned down the line. Smith further trusted that even if the case was randomly assigned to Cannon, they would be able to prove Trump was guilty by sheer volume of evidence. “I’m not worried about Florida,” Smith told Justice Department officials while presenting his decision. Instead, once the case was in her hands, Cannon blatantly took steps to drag it out and turn the tide in Trump’s favor. A year on, the decision to bring the case to Cannon’s doorstep has been interpreted as the case’s death knell. The quest to bring Trump to justice for his alleged crimes disintegrated by election night 2024, by which point the MAGA leader had managed to transform the myriad cases against him into supposed evidence that he was being unfairly prosecuted by a Democratic presidential administration and its DOJ. Trump has since rejiggered the Justice Department in his image, leveraging its heft to prosecute his own perceived political enemies, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and former special counsel James Comey. His next target is California Senator Adam Schiff. Smith has also become the subject of conservative-centric controversies. Republican lawmakers accused the former special prosecutor earlier this month of spying on them during his investigation of Trump, claiming Smith tapped their phone lines and monitored their phone calls. Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley dubbed the right-wing scandal “worse than Watergate.” Smith and his team have vehemently denied those allegations, clarifying in a letter that they obtained telephone toll records, which only contain information pertaining to incoming and outgoing phone numbers and call duration. They do not contain any details of a call’s contents. Smith conducted two parallel investigations into Trump, both of which resulted in indictments. They centered on allegations that Trump mishandled and retained classified records after the end of his first presidential term, and his alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 presidential election. Trump pleaded not guilty on all charges before the charges were dropped altogether after the 2024 election due to Justice Department policy that prevents the prosecution of a sitting president.

Title: Amazon to cut 30,000 corporate jobs — 9% of worldwide office workforce: report
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/10/27/business/amazon-to-cut-30000-corporate-jobs-9-of-worldwide-office-workforce-report/
Time Published: 2025-10-27T21:00:03Z

Amazon will slash 30,000 corporate jobs starting Tuesday, according to a report — unleashing one of the US’s biggest job bloodbaths this century as the company aggressively revamps its business with artificial intelligence. Sources told Reuters the reductions — which amount to 9% of Amazon’s global office-based workforce of 350,000 — will begin Tuesday and could unfold over several weeks. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Seattle-based web giant’s sweeping layoffs mark the biggest in a series of major contractions for the company, which has slashed tens of thousands of jobs since CEO Andy Jassy took over from the company’s billionaire founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. In 2022 and 2023, Jassy cut a total of 27,000 jobs, Reuters reported. Those cuts targeted Amazon Web Services, its devices group and entertainment units including Prime Video and Twitch. Reuters reported that this week’s layoffs could reach across multiple departments, among them human resources — known internally as the People Experience and Technology group — as well as devices, services and operations. Managers in affected areas were instructed Monday to complete training sessions on how to brief employees once email notifications start going out Tuesday morning, sources told Reuters. The latest reductions come as Amazon doubles down on artificial intelligence and robotics — technologies Jassy has described as central to the company’s next phase of growth. In a companywide email in June, Jassy warned employees to embrace automation or risk being left behind, writing that those who “become conversant in AI” would be best positioned to “help us reinvent the company.” He also acknowledged that Amazon expected “efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company” that would reduce the corporate workforce. “AI is allowing Amazon to cut major costs and playing a key role here around efficiency along with other cost cuts,” Dan Ives, global head of tech research at Wedbush Securities, told The Post. Earlier this month, Fortune reported that Amazon was preparing to cut up to 15% of its People eXperience and Technology division, known internally as PXT — a 10,000-person unit that includes recruiting and HR tech teams. Those layoffs are believed to be part of the new 30,000 total. The scale of the latest cuts positions Amazon among the largest corporate downsizers of 2025, alongside Meta and Google parent Alphabet, which have also trimmed staff as AI investments reshape the tech industry. The company has been aggressively reining in costs while committing more than $100 billion in capital spending this year to expand its cloud and AI infrastructure. Amazon’s push to automate its operations has intensified in recent months. Internal strategy documents reviewed by The New York Times showed the company aims to replace more than 500,000 jobs with robots and automate 75% of its fulfillment operations by 2033. Executives have told the board that automation could allow Amazon to avoid hiring hundreds of thousands of additional workers in the US while doubling sales volume. Amazon said at the time that the internal documents did not represent its official hiring strategy and that the company would continue to create new jobs in logistics and technology. Jassy’s cost-cutting measures have included mandatory return-to-office policies, stricter performance management and an annual process known internally as “unregretted attrition,” which encourages managers to push out underperformers. The company’s corporate workforce ballooned during the pandemic as online shopping surged. Since then, Jassy has sought to reverse that expansion while redirecting resources toward more profitable segments like AWS and advertising. Amazon’s stock has risen about 20% over the past year but remains volatile amid investor scrutiny over its long-term profitability. While corporate layoffs loom, Amazon said it still plans to hire 250,000 seasonal warehouse and delivery workers for the holiday rush — most of them temporary roles. Jassy has been pursuing a broad campaign to streamline Amazon’s management structure, arguing that the company had become weighed down by unnecessary layers of oversight. Earlier this year, he said an anonymous feedback channel created to flag inefficiencies had drawn about 1,500 submissions and prompted more than 450 process changes.

By Jill Goldsmith Co-Business Editor UPDATED with confirmation: Amazon has confirmed it’s laying off 14,000 people in a major reduction of its corporate workforce, citing the advance of AI. Looking ahead to 2026, the company it expects “there will be additional places where we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains” as it continues to review its operations. In a memo shared publicly today, Beth Galetti, SVP of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, said, “the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” She said leaders will communicate with impacted teams and individuals today. Watch on Deadline “Last year, Andy posted a note about strengthening our culture and teams – explaining how we want to operate like the world’s largest startup, the importance of having the right structure to drive that level of speed and ownership, and the need to be set up to invent, collaborate, be connected, and deliver the absolute best for customers,” Galetti wrote, referring to CEO Andy Jassy. “Many of you have put significant effort into that work of strengthening your organizations by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and helping reduce bureaucracy. We’re already seeing the results, with teams moving faster and many Amazonians feeling more ownership, and the S-team and I appreciate all the work you’ve done. The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs.” Reports yesterday said the company was targeting as many as 30,000 positions. It’s not clear where the total number will land but it’s shaping up to be one of the biggest round of cuts in the company’s history.. The memo said said Amazon is offering employees 90 days to look for a new role internally and recruiting teams will prioritize internal candidates to help as many people as possible find new roles. “For our teammates who are unable to find a new role at Amazon or who choose not to look for one, we’ll offer them transition support including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more.” PREVIOUSLY: Amazon is planning a heavy wave of layoffs starting Tuesday impacting as many as 30,000 corporate jobs, according to a Reuters report. The e-commerce and web services giant and parent of Amazon MGM Studios and Prime Video is still working to pare down after over hiring during Covid. The cuts will likely cut across divisions. Layoffs of that degree would represent roughly 10% of the company’s 350,000 corporate employees. Its total global workforce, of some 1.5 million full time and part time, is much larger and comprised largely of warehouse employees. Reuters said the cuts would represent the largest round of layoffs at Amazon since some 27,000 jobs were eliminated starting in late 2022, and that managers are undergoing training Monday on communicating with staff ahead of pink slips that will begin to hit email inboxes Tuesday morning. Other reports said the total number hasn’t yet been determined. RELATED: Amazon Reorganizes Audio Divisions, Shrinking Wondery Studio And Laying Off 100-Plus Staffers Amazon in August reorganized its audio divisions, laying off more than 100 workers and dramatically narrowing the scope of its Wondery studio. It January of 2024, it laid off several hundred employees across Prime Video and Amazon Studios as part of a review of its business. Amazon reps were’t immediately available to comment. The report comes as the company is one of several circling Warner Bros. Discovery, which formally put itself up for sale last week after receiving interest from multiple parties. It wasn’t clear if the cuts were AI-related, but CEO Andy Jassy has warned that Generative AI will change the way work is done at the company. It will require “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” he said in a memo to staff in June.

Stocks rallied to more records Monday ahead of a week packed with potentially market-moving events. The S&P 500 rose 83.47 points, or 1.2%, to 6,875.16. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 337.47 points, or 0.7%, to 47,544.59. The Nasdaq composite rose 432.59 points, or 1.9%, to 23,637.46. Stocks also climbed to strong gains in Asia ahead of a meeting on Thursday between the leaders of the United States and China. The hope is that the talks could clear rising tensions between the world's two largest economies, the AP reports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there's "a framework" for President Trump and Xi Jinping to discuss at their meeting, while Trump said, "We feel good" about working things out with China. Keurig Dr Pepper climbed 7.6% Monday after reporting profit for the latest quarter that matched analysts' expectations. The company behind Canada Dry and Green Mountain coffee said it benefited from higher prices for K-Cup products, among other things. Some of Wall Street's most influential stocks are set to report their results this week, including Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft on Wednesday, and Amazon and Apple on Thursday. They'll need to deliver big growth and justify big spending underway in artificial-intelligence technology.

Title: ROOKE: Trump’s Five Fed Chair Finalists Could Signal New Middle-Class Boom Is On The Horizon
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/10/27/rooke-trump-fed-chair-kevin-hassett-warsh-michelle-bowman-christopher-waller-rick-rieder-interest-rates/
Time Published: 2025-10-27T20:32:58Z
Full Content:
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed President Donald Trump has five potential successors to serve as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s successor when his term ends in May 2026. On Air Force One Monday, Bessent told reporters Trump is considering nominating Kevin Hassett, former Kevin Warsh, Michelle Bowman, Christopher Waller, or Rick Rieder to replace Powell. The Federal Reserve Chair serves a four-year term, which is renewable. However, Trump has been vocal about wanting to replace Powell, whom he sees as an obstacle to enacting his economic agenda and rescuing America’s middle class from the decline it had under the Biden administration. While all of Trump’s potential replacements are described as inflation hawks who generally favor interest rate cuts, their stances differ on supporting Trump’s ambitious economic agenda, which includes lower interest rates to boost growth, reduce debt servicing costs, and support policies like tariffs. President Trump says he expects to make a decision on the next Fed Chair before the end of the year. Bessent confirms the five finalists to reporters on Air Force One: – Governor Christopher Waller – Governor Michelle Bowman – Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh – NEC Director… — annmarie hordern (@annmarie) October 27, 2025 Kevin Hassett (White House Economic Adviser): Hassett, as Trump’s longest-serving economic advisor and National Economic Council (NEC) Director, is among the leading candidates to be the next Fed chair, according to a July Washington Post article. He has been a vocal critic of Powell’s tenure at the Federal Reserve and has publicly argued that rates should be at least three percentage points lower than they are now. He has accused Powell and the rest of the board of partisanship in decision-making for refusing to cut rates, the Economic Times reported. (Sign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!) While he publicly supports Fed independence from political influence, his alignment with Trump’s economic policies, including tariffs, suggests he would prioritize lower rates to reduce debt costs and stimulate the economy. During Trump’s first term, Hassett championed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, defending it as a driver of middle-class benefits through increased investment and earnings growth. He has advocated pro-growth stimulus and tax policies to achieve 4 % GDP growth, emphasizing opportunities for the middle class. Kevin Hassett is both kind and brilliant. As Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, he has been instrumental in advancing this Admin’s pro-growth economic agenda & lifting America’s hard-working families. Kevin is a dear friend & will be missed! Thankful for his service! — Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) June 7, 2019 This makes Hassett the most likely to support an economic agenda that promotes middle-class growth. Kevin Warsh (Former Fed Governor): Warsh served on the Fed Board under the administration of former President George W. Bush. Like Hassett, Warsh has criticized the Fed’s decision not to cut interest rates. In April, speaking at a conference organized by the Group of Thirty, an international body of financiers and academics, Warsh urged the Fed to stop relying on “stale” government data in setting monetary policy. He also warned against sharing their “latest musings” on economic forecasts, as it makes it harder to secure “stable prices and full employment.” Kevin Warsh on Fox Business: The Fed can “lower interest rates a lot” to get mortgage rates down. Warsh also says the Fed should shrink its balance sheet to “redeploy that money to Main Street so that Main Street can have the strong economy that we’re seeing in financial… — Nick Timiraos (@NickTimiraos) October 24, 2025 “The more the Fed opines on matters outside of its remit, the more it jeopardizes its ability to ensure stable prices and full employment, and the more vulnerable it becomes to the body politic,” Warsh said, adding, “Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope, encroaching further on other macroeconomic domains.” While Warsh has been a vocal critic of the Fed board since his departure, he has historically been staunchly pro-free trade, which clashes with Trump’s tariff policies, making him slightly less aligned with aggressive middle-class-focused fiscal agendas than Hassett. Michelle Bowman (Current Fed Governor): Bowman, a Trump appointee from 2018, has repeatedly signaled that she supports raising rates to combat inflation if it does not reach the Fed’s 2% inflation target, rather than Trump’s wish for massive rate cuts to induce rapid easing to stimulate the economy. Bowman’s preference for restrictive monetary policies makes her among the least likely to advance Trump’s agenda to cut rates. However, Bowman’s desire to push gradual rate adjustments to maintain full employment and economic resilience aligns exceptionally well with Trump’s plan to grow the middle class. They may not see eye to eye on how to get there, but their end goal seems the same. Christopher Waller (Current Fed Governor): Waller, another Trump appointee from 2020, supported massive rate hikes during the Biden Administration to combat rising prices. Similar to Bowman, Waller advocates gradual rate adjustments to maintain the Fed’s progress on slowing inflation without overstimulating the economy. His balanced approach aligns somewhat with Trump’s push for lower rates. Still, his emphasis on data-driven caution runs counter to Warsh’s view that government data is an unreliable marker because it is constantly revised. Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller: “We need to start cutting rates at the next meeting… Over the next 3-6 months, we could see multiple cuts coming in.” pic.twitter.com/LLqx6biszH — Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) September 3, 2025 He has analyzed the inflationary effects of tariffs and advocates cautious rate cuts to avoid labor-market risks. And while Waller supports stable growth, there is no indication that his monetary policies would help a middle-class boom. Rick Rieder (BlackRock Executive): Unlike the other four picks, Rieder has never worked on the Federal Reserve Board or in any federal economic role. Instead, Rieder comes from the private sector, serving as BlackRock’s chief investment officer for global fixed income. He is a veteran of the bond market. He aligns with Trump’s economic agenda, which argues that the Fed’s high interest rates could contribute to inflation by boosting corporate incomes and spending while restricting middle-class growth. However, like Waller, Rieder sees Trump’s trademark tariffs as an inflation driver. Despite his tariff concerns, he supports rate cuts. Rieder is a unique choice as he’s one of the few who focus on U.S. growth driven by AI. As a fixed-income investor, he favors lower rates and opportunities in income-generating assets, which could indirectly benefit middle-class savers. However, his focus is not on growing America’s middle class, but rather market growth, making him less likely to push Trump’s middle-class agenda if it conflicts with his more market-oriented agenda. (ROOKE: Biden Deep Stater Sings Trump’s Praises On Foreign Policy Wins) Of the five possible Powell replacements, Hassett seems most focused on middle-class growth. And while his Fed Chair role would center strictly on monetary tools rather than policies, he could coordinate closely with Trump’s economic agenda to amplify the middle class.

Title: Amazon to Cut as Much as 9% of White Collar Workforce: Report
URL: https://gizmodo.com/amazon-to-cut-as-much-as-9-of-white-collar-workforce-report-2000677605
Time Published: 2025-10-27T20:25:57Z

Reading time: Reading time 3 minutes Update 10/28: On Tuesday, Amazon announced that it will be cutting 14,000 corporate workers. In a message to employees, Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology, said: Across our businesses, we’re delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology weâve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). Weâre convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business. In other words, she’s saying Amazon is cutting jobs because of AI, but in an exciting way! The affected employees will have a chance to fight for a new position at the company. Galletti said that Amazon will be “offering most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally” and “recruiting teams will prioritize internal candidates to help as many people as possible find new roles within Amazon.” This is an update to a previous post on projected layoffs at the e-commerce giant. You can read the original article below. Amazon plans to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs starting Tuesday morning, according to a new report from Reuters that cites three unnamed people familiar with the matter. Amazon has 1.5 million employees globally (1.2 million in the U.S.), but about 350,000 of those are corporate positions, according to Reuters. Cutting 30,000 corporate jobs represents almost 9% of Amazon’s total corporate positions. The Reuters report cited overhiring from the pandemic as the impetus of the cuts, but not everyone seems convinced by that argument, given the fact that companies have had plenty of time to tinker with their staffing since the onset of covid in 2020. The last massive job cuts at Amazon saw 27,000 people let go in late 2022. Analysts on CNBC debated what was behind the news on Monday, with two other likely culprits: the rise of AI and President Donald Trump’s extreme tariffs. There was strong debate for and against the case that the reported job cuts were coming due to AI, but nobody seems to really know yet. Amazon didn’t immediately respond to Gizmodo’s questions about the Reuters report emailed Monday. The case of tariffs is easier to make, given the fact that President Trump has been so erratic in implementing them, slapping foreign goods with historically high import taxes. Just this weekend, Trump announced an additional 10% tariff on Canada because he was upset about an ad purchased on U.S. airwaves by the premier of Ontario that featured old footage of President Ronald Reagan warning against tariffs. Trump claimed the ad was AI-generated, which isn’t true. The New York Times reported last week that Amazon has ambitious plans for robotics that will help it grow without expanding its workforce. The goal is to automate 75% of Amazon’s operations, according to the report, which could mean that it won’t have to hire 600,000 new workers it would’ve otherwise needed by 2033. Automation has always caused job losses over the past century, whether it’s physical machines in factories or software that can improve the efficiency of white collar workers. But the hype around AI has created a new cycle in the 2020s that has everyone holding their breath. Will generative artificial intelligence prove to be a massive job killer, or will workers adapt to other positions, and things will become more efficient? Nobody knows where it will go, obviously, even as many people predict that the AI bubble is about to burst. Anyone who knows how things will play out (and has some money to burn) has the potential to earn some big bucks in the weeks and months ahead. Some big names are reporting earnings this week, including Amazon (Thursday), Alphabet (Wednesday), and Microsoft (Wednesday). Wall Street liked the news on Monday that Amazon was cutting jobs, as it often does. The stock closed up 1.25%. The DOW, S&P 500, and NASDAQ all closed at record highs.

Title: Paramount Skydance to Lay Off 1,000 Employees This Week, With Additional Cuts Expected Later
URL: https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/paramount-skydance-layoffs-start-1236561992/

Layoffs are coming down at Paramount Skydance this week, with the freshly merged company looking to slash approximately 1,000 jobs primarily in the U.S. on Wednesday, Oct. 29, Variety has confirmed. Following this week’s cuts, more layoffs are expected at a later date, a source familiar with the plans said. Paramount Skydance, headed by chairman and CEO David Ellison, is undertaking a series of deep staffing cuts that are expected to eliminate a total of around 2,000 jobs in the U.S., with additional layoffs taking place internationally. Related Stories Mia McKenna-Bruce to Play Ringo's First Wife Maureen Starkey in Sam Mendes' Beatles Movies A rep for Paramount Skydance declined to comment. The company’s layoff plans for this week were reported earlier by Bloomberg. Popular on Variety Major job cuts have been expected even before the Skydance Media-Paramount Global deal closed, as part of a stated goal of slashing upwards of $2 billion in costs. At an Aug. 7 press conference in New York after the $8 billion Skydance-Paramount merger officially closed, Jeff Shell, the ex-CEO of NBCUniversal who is now president of Paramount Skydance, told reporters that the company would make cost cuts and layoffs as swiftly as possible and be disclosed by the company’s third-quarter 2025 earnings report to investors in November. Paramount Skydance will report Q3 financial results on Nov. 10 after the market closes. Ellison, founder of Skydance Media, has grand ambitions for the entertainment giant. They include a possible second deal for Warner Bros. Discovery that would transform the combined company into a sprawling rival that might better compete with streaming giants like Netflix and newcomers to the entertainment space such as Apple and Amazon, which have invested heavily in entertainment. So far, Warner Bros. Discovery has rejected his overtures. Since taking over Paramount, Ellison has opened his wallet. Paramount shelled out $7 billion for an exclusive seven-year deal for the rights to UFC. The company also recently lured the Duffer Brothers, the creators of “Stranger Things,” over from Netflix with a new four-year exclusive pact to make movies, shows and streaming programming. Some of Ellison’s moves have been more controversial, such as his purchase of the right-leaning outlet The Free Press for a reported $150 million and decision to install its founder, Bari Weiss, as editor-in-chief of CBS News despite her lack of television experience. Ellison, the son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, has signaled a willingness to be aggressive. However, Paramount is grappling with the same issues that are plaguing other media giants. Namely, revenues are falling as viewers have shifted away from cable and broadcast television towards streaming and the theatrical film business has yet to recover from Covid.

Title: Why Is There So Much Consolidation in Hollywood Right Now?

Time Published: 2025-10-27T20:20:04Z
Full Content:
This is the question on everyone's mind as we see more jobs and markets collapse. 'The Master' It feels like every headline I wake up to in 2025 is some sort of notification that one company is being swallowed up by another one, and what we're supposed to do about it. The fact is that the creative industry of Hollywood is slowly following itself as new studios emerge and older studios combine. The ink is barely dry on the massive Paramount-Skydance merger, which just closed in August, creating a new (and hopefully more stable) entity run by David Ellison. Meanwhile, Warner Bros. Discovery—itself the product of a recent merger—is now for sale, and hearing bids from all over. As a writer in Hollywood, I am shedding tears seeing buyers disappear; things are already very hard! But to feel better about the situation, I decided to research and learn why everyone is buying, selling, or merging right now. And it boils down to three main drivers: the end of the streaming wars, a mountain of debt, and a frantic arms race for "universes." Let's dive in. We've been talking about streaming for as long as I've worked at NFS, and we'll continue long after my time is done. It's become the major driver in Hollywood and a way for these studios to make a lot of money. For the last decade, the game was simple: Subscriber growth at all costs. Netflix burned billions on content to get to 250 million subs. Disney+, HBO Max, and Peacock all did the same, losing staggering amounts of money to catch up. It's kind of crazy, but Netflix was so far ahead when it came to building a streaming company that all these other studios wound up spending billions to try to compete with them. The thing is, they were unable to keep up, and in committing to the fruitless chase, they laden themselves with a ton of debt that has crippled them financially. Well, after all this, we began to realize that these companies were no longer profitable, and that affected their stock prices and changed the streaming wars. Netflix is a profit machine. Disney's streaming division is finally in the black. But all the other studios that are still losing money on streaming (or not growing fast enough) are in deep trouble. They can be overleveraged and then have to find a way to deal with these losses... which involves selling assets. Streaming is a business of scale. You need a massive global library to justify a subscription and an ad tier. If you can't afford to build that library, your only option is to buy one. This is why Amazon bought MGM (for James Bond) and Disney bought Fox (for X-Men and Avatar). The Paramount-Skydance deal is the latest example: combining Paramount's library (Star Trek, SpongeBob, CBS) with Skydance's proven blockbuster production (Top Gun, Mission: Impossible) to create a single, more competitive service. And it's what makes WB (Potter, Game of Thrones, etc) such a hot thing for sale. It's funny to think that movie studios have crushing debt just as I do with my student loans. And I would totally sell my last name off in order to escape from it. So, let's use Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) as an example here. The 2022 merger that combined WarnerMedia and Discovery was sold to investors as a "synergy." But it was really just a way to saddle the new company with a crippling $40+ billion debt. And even though their movies did well at the box office and they continue to raise prices on streaming, they have not made too much of a dent. Ever since, WBD's entire corporate strategy has been about servicing that debt. This is the dark side of "synergy" and consolidation. When those two companies came together, they fired people they thought were redundant and got rid of movies and TV shows they didn't want to pay for moving forward. They did all this with the idea that WBD would actually be a very lucrative target to put itself for sale. It's a shark that wounded itself and is now attracting other sharks. Paramount was in a similar boat, struggling with its own debt. The Skydance merger was seen as a lifeline, injecting fresh capital and a new strategy. But Skydance had a billionaire behind the investment that had so much money, no one was worried about the debt. And he has the favor of Trump, so they assume the White House will approve future mergers as well. What I learned was that mergers are often less about a creative vision and more about two companies lashing themselves together to avoid drowning in their own balance sheets. And if you have a ton of money, you can absorb as much of the market share as you want. - YouTube www.youtube.com In 2025, you don't sell a movie. You sell a universe. Okay, that might be overselling it, but this is an arms race, and if you have a giant world like a Marvel or a DC, you have a ton of characters you can put into movies and TV shows to make money. And studios are always looking to expand these stories as well. The consolidation boom is an arms race for Intellectual Property (IP). A studio head doesn't want to buy your brilliant original screenplay; they want to buy a 10-year plan for a franchise that can spawn movies, TV shows, video games, and theme park rides. When you have fewer, bigger companies, their bets have to be bigger. They can't afford to take a $20 million chance on an original drama. They need to spend $250 million on a guaranteed, IP-driven blockbuster that can be spun off in a million different ways to make revenue wherever they can. This focus on universes makes original, standalone ideas—the lifeblood of independent film—an endangered species at the studio level. This is a very hard time to be working in Hollywood. It dfeelsl ike jobs are disappearing and there are fewer places to sell ideas. Consolidation is affecting everyone, from the execs you need to the crewmembers who will work on the film in production. Everyone is suffering. Let's peek at the ramifications. When the majors abandon the middle, they create a massive vacuum. This is the gap where companies like A24 and Neon built their empires—by championing the exact personal, director-driven films the big studios ignore. The Hollywood consolidation means the "studio" path is narrower than ever. But the audience for unique, original stories hasn't gone anywhere. Your strategy can no longer be to just "sell it." Your strategy has to be to make it and find your audience—because the giants sure aren't going to find it for you. And if you get in good at a studio, the money is there for you to continue to succeed, because they're going to need more stories and more success to sustain themselves. The traditional studio system is shrinking. The giants are too busy fighting each other to care about your indie passion project. It's a hard time to see Hollywood eating itself, but it's a good time to know what you're up against and plan your attack in the new reality we all face. Let me know what you think in the comments.

ByMary Whitfill Roeloffs, Forbes Staff. Amazon is preparing to lay off up to 30,000 corporate workers, Reuters reported Monday, news that comes less than a week after internal strategy documents suggested the company would replace 600,000 workers with robots, artificial intelligence and other automation tools by 2033. Amazon, the second-largest employer in the country, is planning to cut as much as nearly 10% of its corporate workforce to "compensate for overhiring" during the pandemic, unnamed sources told Reuters. The news comes less than one week after the New York Times discovered the company has plans to use robots and other automated systems to do the jobs of up to 600,000 employees in the next eight years, rather than add real people to its roster of 1.55 million employees. The corporate layoffs could represent one of the largest job cuts in company history, potentially surpassing the axing of 27,000 jobs in 2022. A representative for Amazon said they could not comment on the Reuters report.

Despite reported plans to eliminate jobs higher up, Amazon has said it plans to hire the same number of seasonal employees it always does: 250,000 across full- and part-time positions during the end-of-year shopping season. Overall, American employers are planning to hire a record-low number of seasonal employees in the final months of the year. If 30,000 people lose their jobs, the cut at Amazon will rank among the largest corporate job cuts in American history, almost equal with the 31,000 jobs eliminated by Boeing in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. The Boeing mass layoff is the 10th- biggest in history. It's been a big year for layoffs. By the end of July, job cuts at U.S.-based companies had already surpassed all of 2024 and, though September, employers had announced almost 1 million job cuts, more than any year since the pandemic hit in 2020, according to career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Andy Challenger, the firm's senior vice president, said the job cuts can be largely blamed on a stagnating labor market, cost increases and "transformative new technology," like AI. Technological updates, including automation, are responsible for 20,000 job cuts so far this year and another 17,375 cuts have been explicitly attributed to AI. The government has laid off more employees than any other sector, followed by tech companies, which have cut more than 100,000 jobs in 2025. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is the fourth-richest man in the world as of Monday with a net worth of $238.7. billion. Amazon is ranked No. 5 on Forbes' list of the largest public companies in the world, with a market value of $2 trillion. CORRECTION (10/27): This story has been updated to note Amazon reportedly plans to rely on automation to eliminate the need to hire for up to 600,000 roles in the future.

Anticipation is building ahead of Ripple Swell 2025, the company’s flagship conference scheduled for November 4 to 5 in New York, with a welcome reception on November 3. This year’s edition is set against a backdrop of growing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, and Ripple is bringing some of the world’s most powerful financial names to the stage. For the first time, the event will feature an extensive lineup of speakers from the White House and major traditional finance institutions, including BlackRock, Nasdaq, Bloomberg, and Citi. Ripple’s 2025 edition of the Swell event is turning out to be filled with the biggest roster yet. Ripple has confirmed that the 2025 edition of Swell will host top executives from some of the largest names in both the crypto industry and in traditional finance. Among the notable names are Maxwell Stein, Director of Digital Assets at BlackRock; Adena Friedman, Chief Executive Officer at Nasdaq; Sandy Kaul, Head of Innovation at Franklin Templeton; and Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Asset Management. Other confirmed participants include senior representatives from Citi, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, Mastercard, CME Group, Moody’s, State Street, DBS Bank, Bloomberg, and Société Générale, among many others. This roster of names is the strongest representation of traditional finance in Swell’s eight-year history. Each of these executives brings deep institutional experience in asset management, banking, and capital markets, areas that are now embracing tokenization, digital payments, and blockchain settlement, and where Ripple is looking to become a major player. Nobody wants to be left behind in the blockchain/crypto movement. Therefore, discussions are expected to focus on how these institutions are preparing to integrate blockchain-based systems into global finance, particularly for cross-border transactions, stablecoin infrastructure, and regulated digital-asset investment products. Observers are also going to be watching for major announcements from Ripple at Swell, like new partnerships, new tokenization offerings, developments regarding Ripple’s RLUSD, institutional partnerships, and possibly some information regarding the launch of Spot XRP ETFs in the US. “From stablecoins and payments to regulation and real-world adoption, Swell brings together the conversations shaping the future of finance,” noted Ripple in a social media post. Adding a new dimension to this year’s event is the confirmed participation of Patrick J. Witt, Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisors on Digital Assets (PCADA). Witt, who serves directly under the White House, will be making his first appearance at Ripple Swell, making this the first time in the event’s history that a sitting US government official has joined the speaker lineup since 2018. The inclusion of a White House voice at Swell 2025 upgrades the conference’s importance beyond the crypto community. It also shows the crypto-positive approach held by the current US administration.

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.69cv9ktuy Share article Print article Over the past few years, markets have been on a wild ride. The price of gold has soared to record highs. Bitcoin is trading above US$100,000 (about A$150,000), at levels that once seemed unthinkable. Hype about artificial intelligence (AI) has put a rocket under tech stocks. US chip maker Nvidia is worth more than Australia’s entire stock market combined. Obviously, this doesn’t tell us anything about where these investments are headed in the future. There are now even widespread concerns AI investment may be driving a bubble. Still, if you did have a time machine, what would be the best way to go back and invest some cash? We’ve crunched the numbers on a range of popular investment options to see how they have performed since 2010. The results might surprise you. Let’s imagine you had A$1,000 burning a hole in your pocket back in 2010. The global financial crisis was still fresh on everyone’s minds, and the investment world was a different place. But maybe you had just received a tax refund, or sold your old car. So, where should you have put that money? By now, that $1,000 could be worth anywhere from $1,428 if you left it in a savings account, to a mind-boggling $466.8 million if you’d invested in Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency is a bit of a special case, so we’ll come back to that later. The Australian share market delivered solid returns. Investing in the ASX 200 – the top 200 companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) – would have turned $1,000 into $3,446 (with dividends reinvested). That’s a 245% total return. Putting it in gold, often considered a “safe haven” investment, would have returned $4,201. Then comes the standout: US shares. Investing in the S&P 500 would have transformed $1,000 into $10,851 – more than triple the return on Australian shares. Even that remarkable figure pales beside a more concentrated bet – the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (owner of Google), Amazon, Meta (owner of Facebook), Tesla and Nvidia. These stocks now account for about 40% of the S&P 500 index and have driven much of its recent strong performance. We can’t measure their performance from all the way back in 2010, because Meta (Facebook) only listed publicly on the US share market in 2012. However, Bloomberg data allows us to reliably track their performance as a basket of stocks since 2015. From that point in time, investing in these stocks would have turned that same $1,000 into $26,074 by today. That’s nearly two and a half times better than the broader S&P 500 since 2010 and more than seven times the ASX 200’s performance. The Magnificent Seven’s outperformance reveals why the overall strength of US shares isn’t just about US companies being better investments – it’s about which sectors and companies dominated global innovation and market returns over this period. The S&P 500 would have given you more than 600% over 15 years in US dollar terms with dividends reinvested. This is impressive, but after you translate the US dollar returns into Australian dollars, you get a return of 985%. That’s because the Australian dollar fell from parity with the US dollar in 2010 to about 65 US cents now. That’s a 35% depreciation that turbocharged returns on US investments. Every US dollar of gains converts back to significantly more Australian dollars today than it did in 2010. Finally, let’s address the elephant in the room. Theoretically, A$1,000 invested when Bitcoin traded around 37 Australian cents in late 2010 could have grown to approximately $466.8 million by now. That’s a whopping 46,682,249% return. However, cryptocurrency investors faced immense challenges over this period. They had to navigate a market with a catastrophic failure rate, where nearly 40% of all coins from 2014–2021 were delisted – mostly as a total 100% loss. Even though Bitcoin appears more resilient than other cryptocurrencies, it has endured intense volatility. It saw annual price swings of over 100% between 2010 and 2015. Cryptocurrency exchange collapses – such as the 2014 failure of Mt. Gox, which resulted in the loss of 850,000 bitcoin – highlight the vulnerabilities in crypto infrastructure. Here is the sobering news: leaving your money in a typical savings account would have seen it grow to just $1,428. That is only 45% growth over 15 years. Savings accounts were paying reasonable interest (although the rate had been declining) until the COVID pandemic, when savings rates plummeted to just 0.5%. When you account for inflation, money in savings accounts has actually lost purchasing power. An investor who turned $1,000 into $10,851 in US shares simply diversified internationally, held steady through multiple crises, and benefited from both asset appreciation and currency depreciation. They didn’t need perfect timing or insider knowledge, just patience and perspective. In an era of unprecedented market concentration, that patient, diversified approach matters more than ever. The best investment strategy isn’t about finding the next Bitcoin. It’s about building a portfolio that captures returns wherever they emerge globally.

Title: The Fed 5: Bessent's short list for Powell's job

Time Published: 2025-10-27T19:03:15Z

EJ Antoni, chief economist at The Heritage Foundation, explains why the Fed has been behind the curve in managing monetary policy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has whittled down his short list of candidates to replace Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to five individuals, he said on Air Force One, The Wall Street Journal reported. Some have connections to the central bank and the White House, while another is a Wall Street powerhouse. President Donald Trump has kept up his verbal criticism of Powell for not cutting interest rates fast or deep enough, calling the chairman a "stubborn moron" and "Jerome Too Late Powell", among other things in social media posts and publicly. Bessent plans to brief Trump on the candidates in full after Thanksgiving, although Powell's term as chairman ends on May 15, 2026. FOX Business takes a look at the contenders ahead of the Federal Reserve’s October meeting on Wednesday in which policymakers are seen cutting interest rates by 25 basis points, lowering the target to a range of 3.75% to 4%. The anticipated rate cut follows the same move the Fed made at its September meeting. Markets also expect another rate cut of that size at the Fed's subsequent meeting in December. TRUMP SLAMS POWELL AS 'MORON' AND CALLS FOR FED'S BOARD TO TAKE CONTROL OF POLICY MOVES Here's the list in alphabetical order. Michelle Bowman was one of the first dissenters at the July meeting. (Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg/Getty Images / Getty Images) Federal Reserve Governor Bowman, who also serves as the Fed's vice chair for supervision, became one of the first dissenters at the July meeting, favoring rate cuts, while the central bank left rates unchanged. She has also made her case for future rates through year-end. Kevin Hassett is the director of the National Economic Council. (Allison Robbert/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Hassett is on his second spin through Trump's orbit. He is the director of the National Economic Council. In the first Trump administration, he was a senior advisor and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Both agencies work in tandem with the White House on economic policies. Hassett said the latest consumer inflation data, which showed a less-than-expected 3% annual increase, is a sign costs are falling. "Our expectation is that inflation is decelerating and that will take all the pressure off the Fed to keep on the path that they are on," he said during an interview on FOX Business Network's "Varney & Co." FED EXPECTED RATE CUT COMES WITH OTHER DILEMMAS FOR CENTRAL BANK BlackRock Global Allocation Team Head Rick Rieder predicts the Fed's next moves on interest rates on 'The Claman Countdown.' Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, oversees $3.2 trillion in customer assets for the world's largest asset manager. BlackRock has more than $10 trillion under management. During an interview with FOX Business' Liz Claman in August, Reider was asked about being considered for the role. "When I first heard it, I thought it'd be the greatest honor of my life. I mean, to actually be considered in a position like that and think about the responsibility, and quite frankly, what I thought about is the ability, and I think why serving your country is such a powerful dynamic, is the ability to help people through monetary policy, through economic transmission, is really powerful," he said. CHEVRON CEO TOUTS AMERICA'S ENERGY COMEBACK Christopher Waller, (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) Waller, like his colleague Bowman, was also among the dissenters in July. The duo signaled a growing divide within the Federal Reserve, which has come under fire for waiting too long to cut rates amid higher inflation and a slowing labor market. WALLER, BOWMAN EXPLAIN DISSENTS AMID FED PRESSURE Former Federal Reserve Board Gov. Kevin Warsh discusses the significance of ADP ending data sharing with the Federal Reserve and the return of inflation data on ‘Maria Bartiromo’s Wall Street.’ The former Federal Reserve governor, who was one of the early contenders for Fed chair, has been a longtime critic of the central bank. "I think their track record is really quite poor in forecasting the growth of the economy from policies like the ones the president put in place. And their inflation forecasts have been terrible, too. That's why they were so late, and that's why we had this surge of inflation that's done the most harm to the hardest-working Americans among us. So, that track record, I think, still matters," he said during an appearance on "Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street." READ MORE FROM FOX BUSINESS FOX Business' Eric Revell contributed to this report.

We are also announcing, as part of a competitive procurement process, Discovery. Working with AMD and HPE, we’re bringing new capacity online faster than ever before, turning shared innovation into national strength, and proving that America leads when private-public partners build together.” “The Discovery system will drive scientific innovation faster and farther than ever before,” said ORNL Director Stephen Streiffer. “ORNL’s leadership in supercomputing has dramatically shortened researchers’ time from problem to solution across a host of fields and industries. With Discovery, the integration of high-performance computing and AI promises breakthroughs at the accelerated speed and scale necessary for continued U.S. leadership in an increasingly competitive global environment.” “We are proud that the partnership between HPE and AMD is at the forefront of advancing the next generation of supercomputing in the AI era for Oak Ridge National Laboratory,” said Antonio Neri, president and CEO at HPE. “HPE’s newest supercomputing solutions harness converged AI and HPC architectures, enabling the lab to achieve unprecedented productivity and scale. This collaboration also reinforces American leadership in applying AI to science, energy and national security.” “Oracle is honored to work alongside the Department of Energy to help drive breakthroughs in science, energy, and national security,” said Mahesh Thiagarajan, executive vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. “Oracle will deliver sovereign, high-performance AI infrastructure that will support the co-development of the Lux AI cluster.” Lux AI Supercomputer: Advancing U.S. AI Leadership Lux at ORNL is the nation’s first dedicated AI Factory for science, energy, and national security—purpose-built to train, fine-tune, and deploy AI foundation models that will accelerate discovery and engineering innovation. Lux is designed to accelerate AI-driven science through its advanced architecture, optimized for data-intensive and model-centric workloads. As a critical resource for the DOE and the National Laboratory system, Lux will give the United States an early and decisive advantage in deploying frontier AI capabilities that transform the pace and scale of scientific innovation. By dramatically expanding the nation’s capacity for scientific AI, Lux strengthens U.S. leadership, accelerates AI-for-Science, and helps ensure that the breakthroughs of the AI era are discovered, developed, and deployed in America. Lux will unleash a new generation of scientific capabilities across the DOE’s mission to, reveal nature’s hidden structure, discover breakthrough materials, accelerate energy innovation, transform biology and biosecurity, and advance national security and resilience. Discovery: America’s Next Leap in Scientific Computing Purpose‑built for AI and science, Discovery features a “Bandwidth Everywhere” design that allows science and AI applications to run efficiently and deliver productive results. Importantly, Frontier laid the foundation for this work, and together with HPE Cray Supercomputing GX5000 – its next-generation supercomputing platform – Discovery builds on that success with a consistent programming environment to ensure an easy transition for users. Discovery will be the DOE’s next flagship supercomputer at ORNL, arriving in 2028, and will extend U.S. leadership in HPC and AI. Advancing America’s innovation agenda, Discovery reflects a strong, public‑private commitment to keep the United States at the forefront of AI and scientific innovation. Building on the breakthroughs of Frontier—the world’s first exascale system—Discovery is designed to deliver dramatically higher performance, energy efficiency, and AI capabilities. Discovery will drive breakthroughs in energy, biology, advanced materials, national security, and manufacturing innovation. It will help design next-generation reactors, batteries, catalysts, semiconductors, and critical materials. Key Points of Discovery: ORNL is expected to take delivery of Discovery in 2028, with user operations expected in 2029. Once online, Discovery will serve as a cornerstone of the American AI Stack, advancing the science, security, and innovation goals that define the nation’s next decade.

Follow the money has been a rule of thumb for understanding American politics since the Watergate scandals of the 1970s, but in the Trump 2.0 era it should be expanded to include following the kinetic power as well. Let’s dive right in and start with the Trump Family, for, as we’ve been reminded by John Helmer, Trump is primarily motivated by personal (and familial) profit. Follow the Money With Drones: The Trump Family Business Just in: Florida-based Unusual Machines, a little-known drone company backed by Donald Trump Jr, said the US army had contracted it to manufacture 3,500 drone motors, alongside various other drone parts. https://t.co/7tgpoLaeIn pic.twitter.com/FBh29vhXgY — Financial Times (@FT) October 24, 2025 In a way, Trump’s devotion to being the pater familias of a political grift dynasty is touching. Along with his sense of humor, and taste for junk food, it’s one of his more relatable traits. The Financial Times has the latest on Donald Trump, Jr.’s latest score, who knew he was a drone builder? A little-known drone company backed by Donald Trump Jr has won its largest contract from the Pentagon, as the US government expands its procurement of the drones. Florida-based Unusual Machines, in which Trump Jr has held a $4mn stake, said the US army had contracted it to manufacture 3,500 drone motors, alongside various other drone parts. The company added the army indicated it planned to order an additional 20,000 components from Unusual Machines next year. Allan Evans, the company’s chief executive, said he believed it was the largest order for Unusual Machines parts from the US government to date, but declined to disclose the value of the contract. … Shares in Unusual Machines jumped as much as 13 per cent on Friday. Unusual Machines brought Trump Jr on as an adviser in November 2024. The Financial Times earlier this year found shares in the company almost tripled in price in the weeks leading up to its disclosure of the move. Soon after Trump Jr came on board, Unusual Machines disclosed he owned 331,580 shares, which would currently be worth roughly $4mn. Trump Jr is not required to disclose whether he has since sold any of his stake, but Evans earlier this year said the president’s son had continued to invest in recent fundraising rounds. … Unusual Machines has struck deals with other US defence suppliers in recent months, inking a $12.8mn agreement with Strategic Logix in September and a $1.6mn deal with an unnamed domestic defence drone maker in August. The company, which is working on manufacturing more of its components in the US, has also been harmed by Trump tariffs. In the first quarter of the year, it said the levies contributed to a $3.3mn operating loss. Unusual Machines has warned the cost of sourcing components from countries other than China could impact profits. Follow the Money to Iowa Where Trickle Down Is Soaking Trump’s Constituents “Since siding with Barack Obama twice, Iowa has become a stronghold for Mr. Trump. Yet perhaps no state has struggled more with his economic policies. During the first quarter of 2025, Iowa’s GDP dropped by 6.1 percent, more than any other state aside from neighboring Nebraska.”… — Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) October 26, 2025 Unfortunately, there’s no indication that Trump’s interests expand enough to include his most loyal rural voters. In his defense, it’s completely unclear that he or his trade team understand the havoc they’ve wrought on American agriculture. Let’s follow the money to Iowa. Per The New York Times When President Trump announced a $20 billion bailout for Argentina this month, Larry Ory, 86, a farmer in Earlham, Iowa, could hardly believe it, especially after boatloads of Argentine soybeans began shipping to China, a once-critical customer for Mr. Ory’s family. For Iowans, losing China’s soybean market in the president’s trade war was only one of many economic shocks that have hit the state since the start of Mr. Trump’s second term. … Since siding with Barack Obama twice, Iowa has become a stronghold for Mr. Trump. Yet perhaps no state has struggled more with his economic policies. During the first quarter of 2025, Iowa’s gross domestic product dropped by 6.1 percent, more than any other state aside from neighboring Nebraska. Manufacturing, which drives 17 percent of Iowa’s economic output, has been hit with higher production costs in part because of steep tariffs on inputs like aluminum and steel. Meatpacking plants, which help make Iowa the nation’s leading pork producer, rely heavily on foreign-born workers, hundreds of thousands of whom saw their legal status stripped away by the president. Mr. Trump’s war on renewable energy also threatens the wind industry that produces more than half of Iowa’s electricity. For now, times are tough. Iowa is the country’s largest producer of corn and second-largest producer of soybeans. America exports as much as half its soybeans, and the vast majority of that had gone to China — $12.6 billion worth last year. But this year, China stopped purchasing soybeans from the United States to retaliate against Mr. Trump’s tariffs. American producers have spent decades working with people in China on how to use soy in animal feed, part of an effort to build up that growing market. Mr. Leeds said he has traveled to the country 25 times and used dollars paid by Iowa farmers to foster strong bonds with Chinese importers. … Iowa’s large beef industry then recoiled after Mr. Trump suggested he would try to lower the cost of beef by importing more from Argentina. … As he deals with those higher prices, Aaron Lehman, a fifth-generation farmer in rural Polk County, said he will continue to use his more than 25-year-old, worn combine. A machine with greater power and a more sophisticated GPS system would cost upward of $100,000 used and more than $250,000 new, he said. Follow the Money: Who’s Paying the Troops? While Trump’s policies may be stressing the economy of key supporter states, the government shut down may be interfering with his plans, or at least Secretary of State/National Security advisor “Little” Marco Rubio. As the Armchair Warlord reminds us on Twitter, failing to pay troops has been an imperial achilles heel through the ages. I feel like the fact that the US military is about to miss a paycheck and we're still moving to attack Venezuela isn't getting enough press. It's a pretty basic military principle dating back to antiquity that you make sure your troops are paid before you start a campaign. https://t.co/bRLaclws8Q — Armchair Warlord (@ArmchairW) October 25, 2025 Into the breach steps Trump Donor Timothy Mellon, per the NY Times: Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and a major financial backer of President Trump, is the anonymous private donor who gave $130 million to the U.S. government to help pay troops during the shutdown, according to two people familiar with the matter. … Shortly after departing Washington on Friday, Mr. Trump again declined to identify Mr. Mellon while talking to reporters aboard Air Force One. He only said the individual was “a great American citizen” and a “substantial man.” “He doesn’t want publicity,” Mr. Trump said as he headed to Malaysia. “He prefer that his name not be mentioned which is pretty unusual in the world I come from, and in the world of politics, you want your name mentioned.” It remains unclear how far the donation will go toward covering the salaries of the more than 1.3 million troops who make up the active-duty military. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Trump administration’s 2025 budget requested about $600 billion in total military compensation. A $130 million donation would equal about $100 a service member. Mr. Mellon, a wealthy banking heir and railroad magnate, is a longtime backer of Mr. Trump and gave tens of millions of dollars to groups supporting the president’s campaign. Last year, he made a $50 million donation to a super PAC supporting Mr. Trump, which was one of the largest single contributions ever disclosed. A grandson of former Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, Mr. Mellon was not a prominent Republican donor until Mr. Trump was elected. But in recent years, he has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into supporting Mr. Trump and the Republican Party. The Daily Beast goes into the source of Mr. Mellon’s hard-earned hundreds of millions: Mellon’s grandfather was the longtime Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, who served from 1921 to 1932 under presidents Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover. Andrew was the son of Thomas Mellon, who founded Mellon Bank, which made his family filthy rich for generations. The donor’s dad, Paul Mellon, was a breeder of thoroughbred racehorses who benefited from the family’s banking riches. By 1957, when Fortune published its first list of the wealthiest Americans, it estimated that Paul Mellon, his sister, and his two cousins were among the eight wealthiest people in the United States. Timothy Mellon’s cousin, Matthew Mellon, was an early crypto investor who struggled with drug addiction. He died in Mexico in 2018, aged 54, just as he was about to check himself into rehab in Mexico. He was divorced from Jimmy Choo co-founder Tamara Mellon, who once wrote that she was “snorting her way through alpine ranges of cocaine” during her marriage to the Mellon heir. “He’s a great gentleman,” Trump said of Timothy Mellon, who appears to be more clean-cut than his younger cousin. “He’s a great patriot. He’s obviously a very substantial man, and he contributed $130 million toward the military in order to make up any difference. So he wanted to see the military get paid.” The same piece points out that the $130 million won’t go far to cover the U.S. military payroll: it averages out to about $100/soldier. Armchair Warlord piles on to that point: People keep on saying this will keep troops from missing a paycheck next Friday. The DoD payroll in 2024 was approximately $192 billion dollars, or about $8 billion per bimonthly payday. This is less than 2% of what's required to make payroll on October 31st. https://t.co/8CZDBPG8ta — Armchair Warlord (@ArmchairW) October 25, 2025 Follow the Money Down the Jeffrey Epstein Conspiracy Path Mellon’s famous last name and the 2025 zeitgeist inevitably led social media sleuths down the rabbit hole Epstein allegations, citing an October lawsuit against the Bank of New York (and Bank of America) by another unnamed alleged Epstein victim. The Wall Street Journal has background on that suit: The suit against BNY claims that since at least 2006 the bank had a relationship with MC2, a modeling agency that Epstein and modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel created. The suit claims that the men used funds from the bank to facilitate Epstein’s sex trafficking. Brunel, who was arrested in 2020 on sex-trafficking charges, died in jail in 2022. The suits were brought by lawyers, including Brad Edwards and David Boies, who have represented many of Epstein’s victims and previously filed similar class actions against JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank in 2022. “The other banks responsible for allowing Epstein’s trafficking should have contacted us during the previous litigation to do the right thing for these victims,” Edwards said. “It is sad that only through lawsuits and Congress are we able to bring justice to this obvious problem.” … JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank have said they regret their relationships with Epstein and settled the suits in 2023, without admitting wrongdoing. JPMorgan agreed to pay $290 million to victims and Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $75 million. Epstein’s estate recently turned over to Congress a list of more than 20 banks that held accounts for Epstein and entities related to him, and several had accounts with Epstein in his later years, the Journal has reported. Right up front, let me quote The Economic Times (India) on the matter so that it’s clear I’m not among those making these claims and am merely reporting on them to show the public mood online: After the NYT report, several posts online began suggesting that Mellon may have been linked to Jeffrey Epstein, due to a lawsuit filed against the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon). The lawsuit, filed on October 16, accuses the bank of facilitating financial transactions linked to Epstein’s operations. However, there is no verified evidence showing any connection between Timothy Mellon and Epstein. BNY Mellon has rejected the allegations and described the lawsuit as baseless. A company spokesperson said, “The claims in the lawsuit are meritless, and we will vigorously defend against it.” Confusion about the Mellon name has contributed to false links. BNY Mellon was formed after a merger between Mellon Financial and the Bank of New York in 2007. After the merger, the Mellon family did not retain ownership or control in the company. The firm became a publicly traded corporation, and institutional investors, including Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, hold the major shares. So case closed, right? Seems like that’s not enough to turn off the X.com rumor mill: But the Mellon's were out of BNY bank by 2008… Oh… wait. pic.twitter.com/5i10VFIRc0 — Diligent Denizen 🇺🇸 (@DiligentDenizen) October 26, 2025 Follow the Money to the Power Under the East Wing Ballroom There’s been a fair amount of MSM handwringing over Trump’s new ballroom which is being built over the rubble of the East Wing of the White House. Most of it irrelevant boo hoo about the brilliant architecture of the Roosevelt era. CNN accidentally mentions something far more important going on underground in the demolition zone: Initially a carriage entrance during the term of President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, it became the modern East Wing as millions of tourists see it each year — or did — under his distant cousin, President Franklin Roosevelt some 40 years later. The build-out was a practical matter: With World War II raging, an emergency underground bunker had been constructed on the spot and needed the building to hide it. … The East Wing was not totally separated from more dire business. The bunker below — officially called the Presidential Emergency Operations Center — is where Vice President Dick Cheney went during the 9/11 attacks, and where Trump was taken during protests in his first term. President George W. Bush used the East Wing to practice his State of the Union address in 2004. Carlyn Beccia has more on Medium: According to the National Capital Planning Commission, no full architectural plans have been submitted — no elevations, no blueprints, no site approvals. Yet demolition has begun. The White House maintains that “preparatory work” doesn’t require review. This neat little loophole somehow allows an entire wing of the most protected building in America to be erased without oversight. … Unofficially, it sits on top of the country’s most secure hideout — The Presidential Emergency Operations Center, or PEOC. The US government built the bunker during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration after Pearl Harbor scared the hell out of everyone in Washington. Today, most White House officials refer to it as “the shelter” or PEOC — pronounced Pee-ock, (as in the sound the Founding Fathers would make if they saw Trump’s renovation). It’s the kind of 5-story bunker that was meant to survive a direct hit — reinforced concrete, steel doors, filtered air, the whole “end of the world but make it dignified” package. …FDR used it as a communications hub; Truman and Eisenhower beefed it up during the Cold War; Dick Cheney was ushered into its lair during the 9/11 attacks. And every president since has at least had a look around, just in case democracy ever needed to hide under the table. After 9/11, the Bush administration realized the White House’s emergency bunker was about as cutting-edge as a rotary phone. Congress quietly funded a massive upgrade, and by 2010, the Obama team was digging under the North Lawn. The official story? “Air-conditioning and mechanical upgrades.” …By 2018…: a new, high-tech command bunker was born, stocked with the latest communications systems, computers, its own air supply, food supply, and enough filtration gear to outlast the apocalypse in style. …The PEOC wasn’t just a bunker; over the decades, it’s rumored to have sprawled into a labyrinth of tunnels connecting to the Treasury, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, and possibly even Lafayette Park. Washington’s soil is laced with secrecy — a place where the Metro can’t dig without bumping into classified concrete. … You don’t just slap a ballroom on top of that without “reconfiguring” something underneath. Which is why this new project, wrapped in secrecy and gold leaf, should have Americans asking the same question: Is Trump building a bigger ballroom or a bigger bunker? All of this sheds new light on what happens when we follow the money to Trump’s alleged “ballroom” donors. The Washington Post has more about that, including the full list of donors: But ethics experts and Democrats say they are turning to a question related to the next phase of the project: whether the donors behind the planned $300 million ballroom that will replace the demolished annex will receive any benefits in return. Tech companies and defense contractors such as Google, Lockheed Martin and Microsoft, as well as wealthy individuals such as longtime GOP donors Stephen A. Schwarzman and Isaac “Ike” Perlmutter, have collectively covered the cost for Trump’s project, according to a list the White House released Thursday. Many of the firms and individuals have business before the administration, such as seeking future federal contracts or eyeing potential acquisitions. … Meredith O’Rourke, a longtime fundraiser for Trump, is coordinating the donations, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the efforts. O’Rourke referred questions about her role to the White House, which did not immediately respond. The donations, which are tax-deductible, are being managed by the Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit that helps manage federal projects. Donors to Trump’s ballroom project have been told to expect some form of recognition, such as the placement of etchings of their names in the ballroom, according to the people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Trump said this week he has raised $350 million for his long-desired ballroom, which will be built on the site previously occupied by the East Wing, the longtime home to a visitor’s entrance to the White House. The annex also provided office space for the first lady and included other features such as a movie theater. The president, who did not specify what he would do with the extra $50 million for the project, said that he has donated “millions of dollars” himself for the beautification of the White House grounds and pledged to personally cover any shortfall in funding for construction of the ballroom if costs continued to rise. Follow the money and it leads to the power, more often than not. Follow the Money to the GOP Congressional Split I’m pushing my follow the money metaphor just to please Google who loves to see “key phrases” repeated ad nauseam, so my human readers will have to forgive me. But I wanted to cover this little swerve in the politics of the U.S. government shutdown fight. It’s not just your usual GOP vs. Democrats split. Hapless MAGA Speaker of the House is Mike Johnson using the shutdown to control the dissident GOP house caucus according to The New York Times: Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to put the House on an indefinite hiatus that is now stretching into its second month while the government is shut down is the latest in a series of moves he has made that have diminished the role of Congress and shrunken the speakership at a critical moment. It’s an approach born of political expedience that could have far-reaching consequences for an institution that has already ceded much of its power to President Trump. And Mr. Johnson, who without the president’s backing wields little influence over his own members, has chosen to make himself subservient to Mr. Trump, a break with many speakers of the past who sought in their own ways to act more as a governing partner with the president than as his underling. … His strategy of indefinite hiatus means that Mr. Johnson has not engaged in the typical political theater that speakers often employ during shutdown fights to jam the party out of power: scheduling tricky votes on bills to reopen parks or pay certain categories of federal workers, like agents for Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection. Democrats had been bracing for him to do so. But instead, he has spent much of the shutdown appearing daily at news conferences at the Capitol, hammering them for refusing to fund the government and making the case that Republicans need not negotiate. He is insistent that the House has nothing to do but wait for the stalemate to end. And he defends a growing list of extreme moves by Mr. Trump. The absenteeism, people around Mr. Johnson said, is a strategic calculation that the best way to keep his unruly rank and file in line is to place them on an extended leave. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who often serves as a sounding board for Mr. Johnson, said in an interview that if the House were in session, “other issues will begin to clutter this up, and there is some small danger that some Republicans might begin to have a mixed message on the shutdown.” In fact, such dissonance has already begun bubbling up even with everyone working remotely. The divide among Republicans over whether to extend expiring health insurance subsidies — Democrats’ central demand in the shutdown fight — has highlighted a political vulnerability for the party. It has all created a strange dynamic on Capitol Hill: Mr. Johnson appears to be using the considerable power of the speakership to render the House irrelevant. This reinforces the arguments of those (like me) who claim the U.S. is in a post-Constitutional order (also see here). For now we can leave the Replubicans behind and apply our follow the money and power lens to the doings of some Democrats. Follow the Money Behind the Platner, Mamdani, Sanders, Porter & Fetterman Campaigns 🧵My latest article on Substack exposes the political consulting firm that turned the Bernie movement into a $134M cash cow, while repackaging and selling centrists like John Fetterman as "leftist change-makers." https://t.co/FXY9akGPhE pic.twitter.com/1C95L2rBNu — Zeynab Day (@ZeynabDay) October 23, 2025 I covered the contested Democratic primary in the U.S. Senate race challenging long-time GOP incumbent Susan Collins last week, but I forgot to include this key nugget about Platner’s consultants. I also could have mentioned this nexus of operatives when covering Katie Porter, who has also employed some of their services on occasion. So in the interest of advancing today’s follow the money theme, I’m going to add some key details from The New Yorker to today’s post: It was three days before a video titled “Platner for U.S. Senate” would drop, catapulting this local oyster farmer, harbormaster, and former marine onto the national stage. The video was produced by Morris Katz, a top political strategist for New York City’s Democratic mayoral candidate, Zohran Mamdani. … The campaign rollout, which was orchestrated by Platner’s senior adviser, Joe Calvello (John Fetterman’s former director of communications), raised half a million dollars in its first four days; volunteer sign-ups for the campaign averaged three hundred a day. “No one was expecting this,” Calvello told me. The Times, ABC, NBC, and Fox News covered the launch, focussing on Platner as a political novice who represented a new approach for the Party. The Bullhorn Bulletin obeys the “follow the money” edict and it leads to more on the coterie of “progressive” consultants profiting off the split in the Democratic party: One of the biggest names in that business is Middle Seat, a self-described “visionary, persuasive, disruptive, and dynamic” digital firm that built its empire branding establishment politicians as grassroots crusaders. Their website showcases glossy ad reels and testimonials celebrating their “progressive” clients and reads like a leftist wish list: racial justice, climate action, immigrant rights, intersectional feminism. The branding is perfect. The business model is cynical genius, raking in a whopping $134 million since 2017. At the top of their portfolio is John Fetterman. Middle Seat’s site features multiple campaign videos of the Pennsylvania senator, portraying him as a blue-collar hero standing up to the system. The problem is, once the cameras stopped rolling, Fetterman stood with the very system he claimed to fight, making what appeared to be a sharp right turn to his supporters, but not surprising to those familiar with Fetterman’s record. Middle Seat’s growing client list raises a serious question: Do they vet their clients? Are they critical about who they sell their branding to, or do they simply offer it to anyone seeking a veneer of leftist populism? The firm claims to be “a full-service media and fundraising firm for progressive causes and candidates,” implying that its work is guided by shared values. Its website even boasts, “We bring our values to work,” and “We build movements that honor the authentic perspectives of our clients.” But do they? Now that we’ve connected previous subjects of these columns, Platner, Porter, and Mamdani, let’s turn our follow the money and power lens to the New York mayoral race as it wraps up. Follow the Money to Mamdani’s New York? The mainstream media seems to have cut Andrew Cuomo’s campaign loose as Zohran Mamdani looks like a sure winner in the NYC mayoral general election, if Politico is representative at least, and it is: Pretty much everyone — including Trump himself, per the WSJ — reckons Mamdani is certain to win next week. The fascinating question for our national politics is what happens next. Even as Republicans issue dire warnings about what they believe New York’s first self-described socialist mayor would do to the city, some will privately admit that — whisper it — they kinda want him to win. Zohran the Boogeyman: That’s because GOP strategists believe Mamdani represents a major opportunity for their party — a politician they can, bluntly, demonize in the eyes of Americans as the sort of terrifying far-left figure that the Democratic Party now represents. And if you thought Trump vs. Gov. Gavin Newsom in Los Angeles or Trump vs. Gov. JB Pritzker in Chicago was something … just wait until the president turns his attention to a new-look New York next year. There’s one more aspect of the New York race I haven’t seen getting enough attention. What will Mamdani do when he catches the car and actually has to administrate the city, including the NY Police Department? Never forget the NYPD has a budget of more than $5 billion per year. Oh and they train with the Israeli Defense Forces and consider the Keffiyeh and Watermelon to be anti-Semitic symbols and therefore violations. So you can guess how many of the rank and file NYPD and their bosses view the incoming Muslim mayor. Mamdani Seems to Be Aware of Kinetic Reality Zohran Mamdani is already making the kind of compromise moves that show he’s aware of his political difficulties with the enforcement arm of the city government he will be running. However, it’s unclear if he realizes the magnitude of what’s he’ll be up against. pic.twitter.com/damDAHVJD0 — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) October 27, 2025 I’m referring specifically of his stated intention to retain Eric Adams’ Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. From The New York Times: Mr. Mamdani has faced deep skepticism from police union leaders and withering campaign trail attacks from former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, his chief rival, portraying him as hostile to law enforcement and soft on crime. Embracing a figure like Ms. Tisch before Election Day could help the Democrat address both potential vulnerabilities — and send a clear signal that he is serious about building an administration staffed by experts who need not agree with him ideologically. In this case, the differences are stark. He is a democratic socialist who once called the department “racist” and “anti-queer” and supported defunding it. (He has since disavowed those positions.) Ms. Tisch is a billionaire heiress appointed by Mayor Eric Adams who has pushed for stricter criminal justice laws. Ms. Tisch’s allies have signaled for months that she would want to stay in the job regardless of the election’s outcome. The campaign officials declined to detail any conversations between the candidate and the commissioner, but said they were confident she would accept. Some of the more vocal members of X.com’s anti-Zionist contingent have a more critical view of Ms. Tisch: holy shit, Jessica Tisch is actually a fanatical genocidal Zionist maniac Likudnik. Listen to her speech at the ADL event recently, where she fully identifies as an Israeli genocidal Zionist and describes October 7 as "a war on us", launders the genocide and smears anti-genocide… pic.twitter.com/5zNrHvivoh — ☀️👀 (@zei_squirrel) October 23, 2025 Follow the Money and Power: NYPD vs Mayor di Blasio’s Family Edition De Blasio 'proud' of daughter Chiara's arrest during George Floyd protests https://t.co/WlcwkFIEAD pic.twitter.com/QOUqZOsgkV — New York Post (@nypost) June 1, 2020 And those of use whose memories extend all the way back to 2020 and the BLM protests in New York can think of at least one compelling reason the mayor should pay very close attention to “his” police department. They doxxed and threatened the daughter of then Mayor Bill di Blasio during the Black Lives Matter protests. From The New York Times: Among the hundreds of protesters arrested over the four days of demonstrations in New York City over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, only one was highlighted by name by a police union known for its hostility toward Mayor Bill de Blasio. The name of that protester? Chiara de Blasio, the mayor’s daughter. The union, the Sergeants Benevolent Association, used Twitter to post a police report documenting the arrest on Saturday night of Ms. de Blasio, 25. The Police Department does not normally release internal police reports, and Ms. de Blasio’s contained personal details, including her height, weight, address, date of birth and driver’s license information. The post was removed for violation of Twitter rules, and the union’s account was suspended Monday morning. “The account is temporarily locked for violating our private information policy,” a Twitter spokesman confirmed. Citing safety concerns, Twitter prohibits users from posting other people’s “private information” without their consent, a practice known as “doxxing.” The practice has been used as a social-media weapon in culture wars, but the publishing of someone’s physical address, for example, could endanger that individual’s physical safety. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was hip to the scene back in the day, per Business Insider: “Last night the NYPD Sergeants’ union *publicly threatened the mayor’s daughter* while they held her. Indefensible,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Monday. “If police budgets bought peace, the $6 *billion* NYPD budget would’ve bought the most sophisticated de-escalatory operation in the world. Clearly, it didn’t.” And there’s also a follow the money angle to the Tisch-Mamdani relationship that the potentially future mayor may be ignoring: Nepo baby and Eric Adam’s crony, Jessica tisch, family is donating millions to Andrew Cuomo against Zohran mamdani. Yet, Zohran still wants to keep her as head cop. Absolute buffoonery going on behind DSA curtains. https://t.co/4cT3N2aNuM — Luis.Documents🎃👻 (@mfsgottenshook) October 23, 2025 Di Blasio’s non-response got him immortalized by the satirical web site The Onion: De Blasio: ‘It Is An Honor To Have My Daughter Doxxed By The Greatest Police Force In The World’ https://t.co/Z3sfVhwTzq pic.twitter.com/P0jkcYDg2n — The Onion (@TheOnion) June 2, 2020 Only time will tell if Zohran Mamdani becomes New York City mayor only to leave office as an emasculated laughing stock like di Blasio. That’s plenty for today’s Coffee Break, I’ll be back with more attempts to follow the money to the power and anywhere else it leads. Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. I wondered about this move on Mamdani’s part, and hope it doesn’t pan out. but honestly I expect the NYPD to be the least of his troubles after the election. Truth is that enough multiple power groups will have their knives out to make the Ides of March look like a picnic. And then there are the two biggies. Hochul might not be the 800 pound gorilla that Cuomo was but Albany will still be a giant brick wall. (You could almost count the beats between DiBlasio attempting something and Cuomo would stomping on his efforts in the most humiliating way possible. Cuomo might not be as flamboyant as Trump but their governing styles have much more in common than “Fix the City” might want to admit.) And then there is the City Council of course. It is still better than being an afterthought yet again from Andy’s endless attempt to sell out to the right people to get a Cuomo in the White House. Back in the early 20th Century (maybe late 19th Century also), there were publications called “Blue Books”. A man would arrive in the city and purchase one of them to find a specific kind of entertainment and companionship. (Being diplomatic). Years later, some said (gossip heard while working in the TV biz) the old Hollywood Blue Book Modelling Agency was more than just a modelling agency. The more things change… mamdani isn’t stupid – he must know that entrenched interests are going to stymy 95% of his proposed changes. his job needs to be communicating to new yorkers and americans at large 1) what he’s trying to achieve for everyone and 2) who exactly is blocking it. name and shame every single one of them. this needs to be daily, specific, and unrelenting. if he can’t or won’t do thar, he’s just more obama hopium for the pussy hat crowd. Ok, now I’m a lot more skeptical of Platner and Mamdani. Platner using Fetterman’s PR guy is a big red flag. Mamdani kissing up to Tisch who is kind of the epitome of everything he claims to be against is a betrayal. Maybe he should find out the cops’ opinion of her before aligning himself too closely, especially since she has no police experience. Of course these issues are ones the establishment has no problem with, so we get the ridiculous smears as their oppo instead. Thanks for bringing up some very valid problems Nat. My pleasure. But I should say, I wouldn’t view their consultant choices as too disqualifying. In my experience, candidates know nothing or next to nothing about campaigns or communications in this era (after all, who would vote for a former campaign manager or political operative?). Therefore, the consultant-candidate relationship is a predator-prey relationship as much as anything. Nor do the campaign consultants follow along to Capitol Hill. After the big Dem sweep in 2006, I was chagrined when so many congressional clients ended up staffed by ex-Lieberman types. Yeah, I’m not discounting Platner completely for that, but it’s good info to have. Earlier people were leery of getting another Fetterman in Platner but I didn’t see much connection between the two. Now there is one. As much as I’ve tried to defend Platner against baseless smears, the thing for me that’s most disqualifying is the fact he’s running as a Democrat to begin with. We have ranked choice voting in Maine and so far I have left Republicans and Democrats completely off my ballot. For me, this is about whether I put Platner as my 2nd choice. If he ran as an independent, which I think he should do if Mills manages to win the primary, I’d consider listing him first. The thing about Mamdani trying to make nice with Tisch is much more concerning. There are many reasons not to trust Platner. For me, the primary and disqualifying one is that, after serving two tours as a machine gunner in Afghanistan, he then spent time as a civilian before, years later, working for Blackwater in Iraq in 2018. That makes his talk about Gaza transact at a very high discount in my mind. Also, as with Fetterman, his Working Class Hero talk is a fraud: he comes from a prominent PMC family near Bar Harbor (which also means he wasn’t an economic draftee in the military). Combine that with his work for Blackwater and you can’t help but question his character or his commitment to his stated positions. Oh, and that “oyster farmer” shtick he uses to brace up his working class cred? Meh: he bought the company a couple of years ago, so he’s more Petit Bourgeois than Working Class Hero. If I were a Mainer, I couldn’t vote for Collin’s or Mills, and still might vote for Platner as a way to highlight the positions he claims to believe in, but I certainly wouldn’t expect much. Thanks MF. I’d like to know a bit more about his family background, but from what I can tell they aren’t squillionaires at least. Taibbi and Kirn were going off about him being a rich guy yesterday and I couldn’t even finish listening – too much trying to ‘own the libs’ without thinking things through, at least in the parts I did listen too. They seemed to think Platner’s campaign was a plan of the Democrat establishment, and I didn’t hear them mention how Schumer tasked Mills with running against him, which would seem to be a clear sign he is not a preferred establishment candidate. I’m wary of those trying to tag these candidates as some elite rich guys. I think you are correct – Platner isn’t a working class hero at all, and much more petit bourgeois, but the petit bourgeois are the ones who have the ability to make some changes more so than the poor working class. They were the ones in charge of both the American and French revolutions back in the day. The candidates educational backgrounds have also been used against them, the elite schools they attended supposedly showing they are phonies. The reason I’m wary about painting with too broad of a brush is because I also went to an elite liberal expensive college, in fact the very same one Mamdani graduated from. But my parents weren’t titans of industry, far from it. As I’ve noted, my family were long time dairy farmers, I got accepted to that school due to getting good grades at a public high school, and went with a lot of financial aid. Yeah, there are a lot of kids from squillionaire families at those schools, but not all of them. So I’m trying to give some benefit of the doubt until I get more info. All that said, I don’t expect much at all. I have a fairly close relationship with an already elected member of the US Congress, and they haven’t amounted to a pisshole in the snow after several terms now. I almost entirely agree with you: in and of themselves, his military service and business ownership are far from disqualifying. After all, the Left should want ex-military people to find its message attractive, and breakaways from Trumps real Petit Bourgeois base are also to be welcomed. We laud FDR for being a class traitor (sort of), and should be open to others doing likewise. Having sent my older daughter to an elite college in Maine (Bates: for some reason we didn’t tour or consider Colby or Bowdoin), I’m in no position to throw stones about educational choices. The problem for me is the way Platner markets himself and elides that background, rather than honestly puts it to the fore. He has the political room to talk about the costs of empire, personally and broadly, but he doesn’t: his criticism of events in Gaza echos a little too closely Obama’s “dumb wars” opposition to the war in Iraq, which we later learned was just part of his overall hustle. And the Blackwater thing is a stench he seems to want to ignore, and for me that’s a far bridge to cross, though others may feel otherwise. What can I say? Twice Obama-ed ( though in self-defense, while I voted for Obama, I never had much faith in him) and Fetterman-ed, thrice shy. PS : Hoping our dear Lambert is well, it would be great to hear him weigh in on this, given his long-time Maine residence. PPS: As for Kirn and Taibbi: I find Kirn slippery, and Taibbi sad: I stopped paying attention to them a long time ago, and I get why someone might feel sympathy or support for their targets, but questions about Platner are justifiable, whatever they might say. Agree, and I’d definitely like more info on his time at Blackwater. Looks like he wasn’t there long – months I think – so maybe he was disillusioned about the whole operation. But I’d like to know for sure. And on an unrelated note, you must be familiar with the annual Colby-Bates-Bowdoin football tournament, the loser of which is deemed to be the absolute worst college football program in the nation. Not sure if that has been determined for this year yet or not. What’s the matter with Iowa? I voted to make America great, and all I got was a soybean boycott. ….So, you actually voted to make America grate. The DJT Jr. and Unusual Machine’s is quite interesting. Looking at the stock chart you would see the expected as in the stock going north once Jr was on board, and the dates mentioned above, but they were not violent moves. One that looks funny to me, and I can’t find any news, was June 2nd. The price had peaked and was trending down. On the 2nd direction changed and it went from around 5.50 to 15. Don Jr is also a partner at 1789 capital, a fund started by NY investment banker, a Thiel sidekick (Buskirk), and Rebekah Mercer. Trump-linked venture fund 1789 Capital tops $1 billion in assets (Reuters, 8th sept) In the months following Donald Trump’s return to the White House, a little-known venture fund with ties to the Trump family quietly crossed a milestone: $1 billion in assets. The firm, 1789 Capital, was once a niche experiment that aimed to align equity investing with conservative political values. This year, it has grown into a financial powerhouse following two strokes of fortune: Trump’s election in November and the addition of his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., as a 1789 partner that same month. Interviews with people close to the firm, along with financial records, reveal a dramatic expansion in its portfolio to include defense contractors, AI startups and other companies that ethics experts say could benefit from federal contracts and regulatory changes. Same fund made the news for opening a Georgetown social club with a $500k membership fee earlier this year. Great find. Mercer, wasn’t she involved in Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal too? Indeed: Mercer was on the CA board Thiel’s Palantir (or at least an employee of theirs) were also majorly involved If I had more time, yarn, and focus, I could create a huge visual of all the connections between the Thielverse/SV VCs and the Trump admin. Short version: AI/defence VC funds are the favoured mode of corruption /slush fund. See also: Dan Caine. Oh and crypto scams obviously. ‘Oh and they train with the Israeli Defense Forces’ Maybe Mamdani can shut down that program on the grounds of ‘patriotism.’ That America has a pop of 335 million with the best police departments in the world so why do they need to train with foreigners. I mean, New York City alone has almost the pop of Israel so what can they really teach American police. The true answer is that Israelis are teaching US police how to treat fellow Americans as Palestinians but he does not have to mention that. RE: “Only time will tell if Zohran Mamdani becomes New York City mayor only to leave office as an emasculated laughing stock like di Blasio.” Only to leave? More like how he began. Immediately after being elected, Bill de Blasio had a secret meeting with AIPAC. He told them it was his job to “defend Israel.” Billy dB tried to keep this meeting secret, but a patriotic staffer leaked it to the media. (The Village Voice?) He cucked out from day one.

Title: Geraldine Weiss Had An Interesting Formula

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. When a stock sports a dividend yield above its own historical average, one of two things has happened. The company may have raised its dividend – usually a good sign. Or, the dividend yield may have gone up because the stock’s price went down. That suggests there’s been bad news, but it hints at a possible bargain. Some investment professionals seek out stocks whose dividend yield is above their own normal level. Probably the best-known practitioner of this approach was the late Geraldine Weiss, who wrote a book called Dividends Don’t Lie. I wrote a column about the Geraldine Weiss approach in September 2024. The five stocks I selected returned 23.4% in the ensuing year, beating the Standard & Poor’s 500 at 17.6%. Those figures are total returns, both price gain (or loss) and dividends. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. I’d like to give Weiss’s approach another try. Here are four stocks that look good to me now, based on her method. The infamous Enron Corp., which went down in the flames of accounting fraud in 2001, has several surviving children. One is EOG Resources Inc. (EOG); the initials once stood for Enron Oil & Gas. Based in Houston, EOG produces the equivalent of more than one million barrels of oil a year. Its mix is about 31% natural gas and 69% oil and natural-gas liquids. Over the past ten years, EOG’s typical dividend yield has been about 1.8%. Today the yield is 3.7%. Geraldine Weiss fans, take note. EOG has been increasing its dividend rapidly in recent years. In 2019 the dividend was $1.01 a share. In the past four quarters the payout has been $3.77. Molson Coors Beverage Co., a brewer based in Golden, Colorado, has averaged a 2.5% dividend yield over the past decade. Today the stock yields 4%. The shares have done miserably over the past ten years, losing close to half of their value. Many investors think that beer is a buggy-whip industry. U.S. beer sales have been declining, and imports are grabbing an increasing share of a shrinking pie. Sensibly, Molson is trying to diversify away from beer, offering hard cider, hard seltzer, canned cocktails and energy drinks. These days, many investors think of Novo Nordisk AS (NVO), which is based in Denmark, primarily as a weight-loss drug maker. I, however, think of it primarily as a leader in diabetes medications. The stock peaked at about $147 last year, and has descended all the way to $53 as Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) has moved to the front in weight-loss drugs. After its fall, Novo Nordisk shares yield 3.3%, well above the ten-year median of 1.9%. The company’s net profit margin is above 35% and its return on stockholders’ equity is about 81%. Even if those figures decline some, I think the stock is a bargain, selling for about 14 times earnings. Based in New York City, Interparfums Inc. makes and sells perfume and cologne under a wide variety of licensed brands, such as Coach, Karl Lagerfeld, Montblanc and Van Cleef & Arpels. Its dividend yield has normally been about 1.7%. Now it’s 3.2%. The stock has declined, partly because sales and earnings growth have slowed, and perhaps partly because investors fear a recession. It peaked at about $158 five years ago, and now sells for around $96. I think the decline is overdone. Growth was still pretty good in the past year, with sales up 7% and earnings up 17%. My maiden column discussing Geraldine Weiss’s approach was encouraging, as three of my five picks beat the S&P 500’s return, and all five were profitable. The best performer was UGI Corp. (UGI), which distributes natural gas, propane and electricity, mostly in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It returned 43% (including dividends). Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) attracted a takeover offer from a private equity firm, Sycamore Partners. It returned more than 37%. Also beating the index, but by a narrower margin, was Magna International Inc. (MGA), a Canadian auto parts maker. Considering the trade frictions (and other frictions) between the U.S. and Canada, I’m pleasantly surprised. US Bancorp. (USB) and Greif Inc. (GEF.B) returns 10% and 4% respectively, trailing the index. Disclosure: I own Novo Nordisk personally and for most of my clients. Katharine Davidge, my wife and a portfolio manager, owns EOG personally and for clients.

Title: Qualcomm Stock Is Soaring Today After Chipmaker Makes a Big AI Move

Qualcomm is joining the competition to supply chips for AI data centers. Qualcomm (QCOM), which has largely focused on chips for mobile phones, laptops and other consumer devices to date, on Monday unveiled two AI accelerator chips for data centers: the AI200, which is set for release in 2026, and the AI250, which is planned for 2027. Shares of Qualcomm were up more than 13% in recent trading, pacing gainers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. With Monday's gains, they've added about one-quarter of their value in 2025. Qualcomm's expansion into the market for data center chips comes as a growing number of companies look to capitalize on booming demand for AI with products catering to data centers. The share prices of many of those companies have surged, helping power the broader stock market to record highs. The move marks a big step for Qualcomm, which said that it will be committed to a data center roadmap with an annual cadence for major releases or updates going forward. It could also mean more competition for leading AI chipmakers such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), with several analysts suggesting in recent weeks that they see Nvidia's dominant market share diminishing over time as competition and demand grows. Shares of Nvidia were up 2.5% in recent trading amid a broader market rally, while AMD shares were up slightly after hitting an all-time high at the open.

Title: The Reluctant-To-Go CEO’s Guide To Succession Planning

ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. CEOs always have a difficult job, but in today’s times of economic uncertainty, tough competition, increasing investor scrutiny to hit performance targets, relentless media cycles and disruption from all sides, it’s getting harder. With all that pressure, a positive and trustworthy relationship between the CEO and board of directors is vital. Earlier this month, the National Association of Corporate Directors released a playbook for both boards and CEOs to deepen this relationship and build trust. NACD formally introduced the report with a roundtable discussion at its annual Directors Summit. A 25-member Blue Ribbon Commission wrote the report, composed of current and former CEOs and board members, co-chaired by Wayne Peacock, former CEO and president of USAA, and Dona Young, former chair, president and CEO of the Phoenix Companies. To begin with, the board and CEO need to build a trust foundation by defining their roles, including how they will work together and how the CEO and board leader can partner. Then they need to operationalize that trust, communicating beyond meetings, enhancing evaluations of one another to reinforce intended behaviors, using executive sessions to help build accountability and transparency, and prioritizing the CEO’s overall well-being. Next, spell out how to leverage that trust to maximize the board’s value as a strategic advisor and assess board composition to align with what is needed for strategy and value creation. At the roundtable discussion, Peacock said that today’s business environment is dynamic, filled with urgency and uncertainty. “If you build trust, you’re operationalizing that on an ongoing basis, then you have the ability to move at a faster pace than you would otherwise have,” he said. “I think also, from a very practical standpoint, whether it’s the noise…or the disruption from other changes that are happening, the ability to separate the signal from the noise as a company today and focus on: ‘What is our mission, what are the values we stand for, what are the things we can control in this environment, and how do we build scenario planning around what could be a wide set of outcomes going forward?” become part of the skills and expertise of senior management in collaboration with the board. Which comes back to: If we built those strong trust foundations, and then we have the ability to use the best thinking of everyone on the board and senior management, we will be better prepared to adapt and change in a much more dynamic environment.” Another important aspect of the board-CEO relationship is succession planning. Sometimes it’s easy, but there are some legacy CEOs—often founders or those who have been there long enough to believe they define the company—who can be difficult to budge from the corner office. I spoke with Shawn Cole, president and founding partner of executive search firm Cowen Partners, about what CEOs should be thinking about succession planning, especially if the “legacy CEO” description hits close to home. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. As the federal government shutdown enters its fourth week with no end in sight, the drag on the economy—both now and in the future—is becoming apparent. Delayed government inflation data for September was released on Friday, revealing that inflation last month continued to tick up. Prices were up 3% compared with a year ago, and had risen 0.3% since August. And consumer sentiment continues to decline, with the University of Michigan’s monthly survey dropping 2.7% to a score of 53.6. According to the survey, Americans’ views on current economic conditions fell to the same level as August 2022, when inflation was 8.3%. An AP-NORC poll last week found that just 32% of Americans viewed the economy positively. Focusing only on businesses, Forbes senior contributor Simon Moore writes that this shutdown is likely to suppress Q4 GDP growth by as much as 0.5%, though not completely neutralize growth or turn it negative. How much it will hurt is not known, especially since negotiations to tend the shutdown do not appear to be underway. The most recent government shutdown in 2018 and 2019, which was also the longest on record, had an impact of $18 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, Moore wrote. Much of the planned spending for that period happened anyway, but was delayed, so the lost spending was estimated at $3 billion. Some economic policy changes may be close on the horizon, though. The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meets later this week and will discuss interest rates. According to CME FedWatch, on Monday morning 96.7% of analysts are expecting a quarter-point rate cut this week, bringing rates down to between 3.75% and 4%. But that’s not necessarily great news. Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman writes that the conditions may be ripe for stagflation—when economic growth is tepid, but inflation and unemployment are both rising. Last week, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services issued some guidance on President Donald Trump’s controversial new $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas. Forbes senior contributor Stuart Anderson writes the fee applies to new petitions for the visas filed at or after 12:01 a.m. September 21, as well as for requests for consular or port-of-entry notifications, or pre-flight inspections for noncitizens already in the U.S. It does not apply to people who are already legally in the country and requesting amendments, changes of status or extensions of stay—so the fee would not be required for a person with an F-1 student visa who is applying for an H-1B visa. Additionally, the guidance states that people with H-1B visas may leave and re-enter the U.S. However, Anderson notes, the language in the new guidance seems to be more restrictive than in Trump’s executive order about the fee, and appears to leave little room for exceptions. The new fees are already impacting job offers, even for some of the world’s largest companies. Walmart paused corporate offers to candidates requiring H-1B visas, Bloomberg first reported. The retailer currently employs about 2,390 H-1B visa holders, and a spokesperson told Forbes that Walmart “is committed to hiring and investing in the best talent” and will do so “while remaining thoughtful about our H-1B hiring approach.” The hike in the visa’s fee is being challenged in court. The Chamber of Commerce filed a suit earlier this month, saying the huge hike exceeds the president’s authority and “would inflict significant harm on American businesses, which would be forced to either dramatically increase their labor costs or hire fewer highly skilled employees for whom domestic replacements are not readily available.” Another giant shakeup in the media world could be in the near future. Last week, media conglomerate Warner Bros. Discovery announced it would launch a “review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.” These could include selling the entire company, selling off either of its two major companies—Warner Bros. or Discovery Global—or going forward with its already-announced plans to split into separate entities, one for its streaming and studio assets, and the other for its global networks, including CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery. The move was likely precipitated by a rumored bid last month from Paramount Skydance to buy the company. The multibillion Paramount Skydance deal had been pending before regulators for a year, and was completed in August after the company made concessions to President Donald Trump’s priorities. The rumored bid has so far not been successful, and Forbes senior contributor David Bloom writes that’s probably a good thing, considering Warner’s movie studio has not seen sweeping box office success in the recent past. Another rumored suitor is Netflix, which issued its quarterly earnings report the same day Warner Bros. Discovery announced its review. Bloom writes that much of the discussion on the earnings call was about whether the streaming giant would buy the movie and cable network company. The public answer, at least for now, is no. However, because the broadcast industry is becoming increasingly consolidated, any potential buyer of the company would likely face regulatory scrutiny. Forbes senior contributor Peter Cohan looked at potential suitors for Warner Bros. Discovery and their likelihood to be able to complete the transaction—looking at both regulatory hurdles and ability to pay. Cohan reported that if the company actually does put itself up for sale, analysts see less obvious suitors with fewer antitrust issues—including Amazon and Apple—potentially making a bid. CEOs are critical. They set the agenda, establish the business tone, develop strategies for the future, serve as the lead business representative and make major decisions. However, executive search firm Cowen Partners president and founding partner Shawn Cole said, no CEO is actually synonymous with the company they lead. All CEOs, from founders to longtime leaders, should prepare for their exits—even if they don’t want to. I talked to him about what all CEOs—especially those who may associate themselves too closely with their role—should think about succession planning. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. There are many reasons legacy CEOs stick around and, at least externally, don’t talk about succession planning. What could make them at least start to think about it? Cole: Business in general is changing faster on a more regular basis than ever. Maybe [a CEO in this position would start] recognizing that I may not be the best captain for the ship anymore, that it is evolving faster than perhaps someone of that profile could keep up with. I also think, unfortunately, that it seems like it’s more of a lifestyle business. It’s not a full-time job, it’s a prestigious title to hold. Are you really giving it 110%, or is it really fun to travel the world and go speak at conferences, engagements or whatnot? Are you a figurehead or are you the CEO? If you want to tie it to wealth and shareholder value, what could be realized by having someone with a bit more energy and a little bit more appetite or knowledge of current events and trends? What would that look like for the share price? I would watch for more and more people dying in the seat. We’re getting to a point of no return, going back to mortality. Do you want that to be your legacy? Do you want your legacy to be total effing chaos when you left—or when you passed away—because you didn’t plan for a successor? Also [think of your] family. Do you really want your final years to be working or do you have other things you’d like to do? In this kind of scenario, where should succession planning start, both on a board level and an individual level? At a board level, you need to start identifying what a transition looks like, what a handoff looks like, what a successful on-ramp of your successor looks like, and who that successor is. The other aspect is it can sometimes turn into that TV show Succession, where it just destroys your C-suite because everyone’s been promised something. [It’s important to] have a clearly defined—internally, externally, shared or otherwise—plan for a successor so that you’ve got your number one and two at the same time, and you align that to your timeline. A lot of succession planning is like the anointment of a successor, and maybe it needs to be a lot more objective. There could be scoring involved. You could hire a consulting firm to assess internal and external candidates—because if you have a legacy CEO, most likely your No. 2 probably isn’t as strong as an outside candidate. You probably already lost some stronger [internal] candidates. They went on to somewhere else where they could have an opportunity to be CEO. Oftentimes these legacy CEOs’ internal pipeline isn’t that strong because they don’t foster strong internal talent. They foster yes people. What advice would you give a legacy CEO about looking at succession and planning? Look to the transitions that have failed, and ask yourself if you want to be the next one. Do you want that to be your legacy? Sometimes the narcissism, the selfishness [makes it appear] they seemingly don’t care or [could say], ‘I did such a good job. It’s impossible to find my successor.’ No. You set this up for failure because it was a knee-jerk response. There was no pipeline. This was not in the works for years. We had to go outside to someone that had no idea what our business was about. I would just ask: What do you want to be affiliated with? Do you want to be affiliated with a smooth handoff and a legacy of success? Or do you want to be the person that retired and it went [south] for lack of planning? What do you want the Wikipedia page to say? You may not be in favor of the Silicon Valley-style 996 workweek, but it is really difficult for a successful CEO to spend just 40 hours a week working. Being in a job that requires more of your time and thought means you need to invest more time on careful work-life integration. Layoffs can be an unfortunate reality when businesses need to change their strategy or free up funds in an uncertain economy. But many workers say leaders at their business lack empathy when laying off employees, which can negatively impact how the workers who stay feel about their employer. Here’s how to show more empathy and keep a bad corporate situation from becoming worse.

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. The Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) token surged nearly 100% in four days to $1.63 after integrating Coinbase’s x402 protocol. The Trump family-backed American Bitcoin has announced the acquisition of around 1,414 Bitcoin BTC $112 550 24h volatility: 1.1% Market cap: $2.24 T Vol. 24h: $67.91 B . As of October 24, the company’s total Bitcoin balance stands at 3,865 BTC, obtained through mining operations and strategic acquisitions. The latest purchase strengthens its position as one of the world’s largest corporate holders of the asset. The company, ranked as the 26th largest corporate Bitcoin holder, said part of these assets are held in custody or pledged under an agreement with mining hardware provider Bitmain. Following the acquisition announcement, ABTC shares surged 11.5% to $5.62, suggesting investor confidence in the company’s long-term Bitcoin strategy. American Bitcoin has also introduced a new reporting metric, Satoshis Per Share (SPS), which measures the amount of Bitcoin indirectly owned by each shareholder through their stock holdings. This comes after the firm previously announced plans to raise up to $2.1 billion in Class A shares, with funds allocated toward Bitcoin purchases, ASIC equipment, and general corporate growth. While American Bitcoin’s aggressive accumulation caught headlines, BlackRock also made a notable BTC move. The world’s largest asset manager transferred $118 million worth of Bitcoin to Coinbase Prime. BlackRock just deposited 1,021 $BTC($118M) and 25,707 $ETH($107M) to #CoinbasePrime.https://t.co/qmuDIrPHc6 pic.twitter.com/JJwMCcUXMu — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 27, 2025 Market analysts suggest these transfers are part of routine liquidity adjustments or ETF-related rebalancing. However, some believe that it could also be a sign of a major sell-off as the cryptocurrency started the week with a green candle. At press time, Bitcoin is trading around $115,000, up 1.4% in the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency’s daily trading volume doubled on October 27. Bitcoin’s price has maintained upward momentum since October 23, climbing beyond $112,000-$113,000 resistance zone. This breakout pushed the cryptocurrency above three key on-chain cost bases, indicating renewed market confidence. Data from CryptoQuant shows nearly 7 million BTC have returned to profit, including 5.1 million BTC held by investors within six months. Analysts say that as short-term holders regain profitability, they tend to hold longer and increase positions. This is a classic sign of rising bullish conviction.

Title: Trump Mulls More Aid to Argentina as Americans Set to Lose Food Stamps

Time Published: 2025-10-27T15:43:53Z
Full Content:
Donald Trump hasn’t ruled out giving more money to Argentina, he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday. The president claimed that the country’s midterm election results on Sunday, which went very well for right-wing President Javier Milei, are good for the United States because bonds have gone up, making “a lot of money for the United States.” When a reporter asked if Argentina would need “more support,” referring to the president’s $40 billion bailout of the country, Trump replied in the affirmative. “They might. Yeah, we would consider it,” Trump said. Trump on Argentina: I think we've made a lot of money based on that election because the bonds have gone up… That election made a lot of money for the US… Reporter: Will they need more support or would you consider it?Trump: They might. Yeah, we would consider it. pic.twitter.com/0YMd750W1Y Trump’s comments come as SNAP funding is set to expire in five days thanks to the government shutdown, with millions of Americans expected to lose food stamps across the country. Health care subsidies are also on the verge of expiring in the U.S., causing health insurance premiums to skyrocket for millions of Americans. Meanwhile, the up to $40 billion bailout for Argentina that Trump has already approved benefited major hedge funds, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Pimco, as well as Robert Citrone, a close friend of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who founded the hedge fund Discovery Capital Management. Thus, when Trump brags that Argentina’s right-wing government is making money for the U.S., he’s not referring to the average American struggling to make ends meet, but rather financial executives and hedge funds. But Trump never was too worried about how the average American is doing. Donald Trump is economically punishing Canada (and the American public) for daring to televise Ronald Reagan’s position on tariffs. The president announced Saturday that America’s northern neighbor would literally pay for Ontario’s decision to air portions of one of Reagan’s 1987 radio addresses, in which the conservative icon argued that tariffs undermine economic prosperity and only serve to “hurt every American.” The 35 percent tariff on Canadian goods would increase by at least 10 percent, Trump said. The advert really irked Trump, who claimed that the very real speech was a “fake.” Trump also cited the advertisement as his reason for canceling trade talks with Canada and then deciding to actually impose more levies on America’s Hat as recompense for the stunt. “Canada was caught, red handed, putting up a fraudulent advertisement on Ronald Reagan’s Speech on Tariffs,” Trump posted to Truth Social. “The Reagan Foundation said that they, ‘created an ad campaign using selective audio and video of President Ronald Reagan. The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address,’ and ‘did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal options in this matter.’ “The sole purpose of this FRAUD was Canada’s hope that the United States Supreme Court will come to their ‘rescue’ on Tariffs that they have used for years to hurt the United States. Now the United States is able to defend itself against high and overbearing Canadian Tariffs (and those from the rest of the World as well!).” While the ad stitched together some of Reagan’s quotes from different parts of the speech, none of the soundbites used in the ad were made up. In fact, the speech in its entirety reveals Reagan was much harsher on tariffs than the ad made him out to be. The ad was developed by Ontario’s provincial government. The goal of the ad, per Ontario Premier Doug Ford, was to reach as many Americans as possible. After a conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Ford announced the decision to pull the ad, which will officially stop airing on Monday. But ultimately, Trump doesn’t appear able to grapple with the reality that his Republican hero considered his favorite economic stratagem a total dud. “Ronald Reagan LOVED Tariffs for purposes of National Security and the Economy, but Canada said he didn’t!” Trump continued in his post. “Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD. Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10 percent over and above what they are paying now.” Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One Monday, Trump said he had no interest in meeting with Carney to resolve the matter, further elaborating that he wouldn’t be meeting with Carney “for a while.” President Trump on Monday bragged about passing a dementia test, while challenging Democrats decades younger than him to try and do the same. “[We] have a great group of people, which they don’t,” Trump said while taking questions inside Air Force One. “They have Jasmine Crocket, a low-IQ person. [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] is low IQ.… Have her pass, like, the exams that I decided to take when I was at Walter Reed. Those are really hard, they’re really aptitude tests, I guess, in a certain way. But they’re cognitive tests.” The “cognitive tests” that Trump is bragging about so proudly—and condescendingly telling two outspoken, progressive women of color to take—is most likely some variation of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The MoCA is a 10-minute assessment designed to identify signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s, and yet Trump talks about it like it was the Graduate Record Examinations or the LSAT. Trump visited Walter Reed Medical Center earlier this month, raising questions about whether he once again took the dementia test on this visit. The president has been bragging about this test for years now. “It was 30 to 35 questions.… The first questions are very easy. The last questions are much more difficult. Like a memory question. It’s, like, you’ll go: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. So they say, ‘Could you repeat that?’ So I said, ‘Yeah. It’s: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV,’” Trump said back in 2020. “They said nobody gets it in order.… It’s actually not that easy, but for me, it was easy.” “I think it was 35, 30 questions,” he said again last year. “They always show you the first one, like a giraffe, a tiger, or this, or that—a whale. ‘Which one is the whale?’ OK. And that goes on for three or four [questions], and then it gets harder and harder and harder.” The test itself is controversial within the medical community, and Trump’s misrepresentation of it has been thoroughly debunked over the years. “It’s a very, very low bar for somebody who carries the nuclear launch codes in their pocket to pass and certainly nothing to brag about,” Jonathan Reiner, a George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences professor and cardiologist, told The Washington Post last year. And yet Trump, in the midst of a government shutdown, continues to place the MoCA on a pedestal, using it to disparage Representatives Crockett and Ocasio-Cortez even though they could likely pass it with flying colors. Especially if it just consists of “Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.” President Donald Trump’s administration claims that its hands are tied against funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program while the government is closed, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s own shutdown plan says that’s not the case. The USDA published a memo in August claiming that SNAP contingency funds could not legally be used to cover regular benefits for the 42 million Americans that use them, and that any states trying to cover the cost would not be reimbursed, Axios reported Monday. “SNAP contingency funds are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover benefits,” the memo stated. “The contingency fund is not available to support FY 2026 regular benefits, because the appropriation for regular benefits no longer exists.” Now the funds could solely be used for so-called contingencies, such as natural disasters, USDA claimed. “For example, Hurricane Melissa is currently swirling in the Caribbean and could reach Florida,” the memo stated. “Having funds readily available allows the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to mobilize quickly in the days and weeks following a disaster.” But the USDA’s Lapse of Funding Plan, published a month later and which Axios reported has been removed from the agency’s website, stated just the opposite. “OMB’s General Counsel provided a letter to USDA on May 23, 2025 stating that there is a bona fide need to obligate benefits for October—the first month of the fiscal year—during or prior to the month of September, thereby guaranteeing that benefit funds are available for program operations even in the event of a government shutdown at the beginning of a fiscal year,” the disappeared document states. “In addition, Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue since the program has been provided with multi-year contingency funds that can be used for State Administrative Expenses to ensure that the State can also continue operations during a Federal Government shutdown,” the plan stated. “These multi-year contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year.” The memo also claimed that using the contingency funds would prevent additional transfers to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, which has reportedly been funded using Trump’s tariff money during the shutdown. This latest memo from the USDA is part of a wider campaign from the Trump administration to hold the health and well-being of millions of Americans hostage, while suggesting it is the Democrats who are responsible. In fact, the USDA website currently has a banner at the top explicitly blaming Democrats for the shutdown. But in reality, it is the White House that is picking and choosing which projects to fund and what to withhold to make Americans hurt—so it can pressure Democrats into signing a clean continuing resolution. Earlier this month, the USDA sent a letter to states warning that a lapse in appropriations had resulted in “insufficient funds” to pay SNAP benefits through November. Last week, states began to issue warnings to their most vulnerable residents that benefits would be suspended starting in the middle of October. President Trump is doing absolutely nothing to dispel the growing rumor that he will completely disregard the Constitution to run for an illegal third presidential term. “Steve Bannon said in a recent interview that there would be plans for you to be able to run and potentially win a third term in 2028,” a reporter asked Trump on Air Force One on Monday. “Is that something you’d be willing to challenge in court?” “Well, I haven’t really thought about it, we have some very good people as you know,” he replied. “But uh, I have the best poll numbers I’ve ever had.” After saying Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio could run for president in 2028, Trump again brought it back to himself. “I would love to do it,” he emphasized. Asked by a reporter if he wasn’t ruling out a third term, Trump replied, “Am I not ruling it out? I mean you’ll have to tell me.” Reporter: Bannon said there could be plans for you to be able to run and potentially win a third term Is that something you'd be willing to challenge at the court to be able to do?Trump: I haven't really thought about it. We have some very good people as you know.. but I have… pic.twitter.com/gNnSAYsOoi The president is wrong about the poll numbers, as they are currently some of the lowest he’s experienced. And more importantly, the president has absolutely thought about 2028—he’s already had the hats made. Steve Bannon, his former right hand, has made the actual plans abundantly clear. “Trump is gonna be president in ’28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,” Bannon said in an interview with The Economist published last Thursday. “There’s many different alternatives. At the appropriate time, we’ll lay out what the plan is, but there’s a plan and President Trump will be the president in ’28.” Trump’s complete nonanswer, combined with everything Bannon and the deep MAGA base has said about it, should raise alarm for anyone still holding onto whatever constitutional values still apply in this country. The most corrupt president in modern history is planning a constitutional coup, and it’s highly unlikely that he’ll let tradition and custom—things he’s never cared about—stop him. The head of CNN reportedly wants his network to tone down its coverage of President Trump destroying the White House’s East Wing as he builds his enormous ballroom. Status reports that CNN CEO Mark Thompson told his staffers on a conference call Thursday to reduce the network’s coverage of the White House’s destruction, one day after he had paid a visit to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The Wednesday meeting at the White House was supposedly about CNN’s upcoming streaming product and an opportunity for Trump administration officials to appear on the network, but Thompson’s words to CNN employees raise the question of whether Trump officials told him to alter the network’s coverage. Staffers at the network are suspicious, according to Status, especially considering that CNN anchor Jake Tapper has been trying to get an interview with the president. CNN has denied the report. “This is reckless and irresponsible conjecture without any fact checking done prior to publication,” a spokesperson said in a statement to The New Republic. The network has a historically bad relationship with Trump, with its correspondents often butting heads with the president going back to before his first term, and its parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, is up for sale with Trump ally David Ellison among the leading suitors. During his second term as president, Trump has made no secret of his grudges against media outlets, seeking to punish them through the FCC and defamation lawsuits. Despite Thompson’s reported words during the editorial call, the outlet has still covered the destruction of the East Wing since Thursday. Could Trump be trying to take advantage of CNN and engineer softer coverage? Is Thompson trying to save his own job in the event Ellison acquires CNN? Either way, it’s another example of the Trump administration infringing on the freedom of the press. This story has been updated. Senator Rand Paul is on a campaign to knock President Donald Trump off of his warpath. During Paul’s appearance on Fox News Sunday, host Shannon Bream asked the Kentucky Republican what information he wanted the government to provide about its military strikes in the Caribbean Sea. But Paul said that a briefing wasn’t what he was after. “A briefing’s not enough to overcome the Constitution,” Paul said. “The Constitution says that when you go to war, Congress has to vote on it. And during a war then, [there are] lower rules for engagement and people do sometimes get killed without due process. “But the drug war, or the crime war, has typically been something we do through law enforcement. And so far they have alleged that these people are drug dealers. No one said their name, no one said their evidence,” Paul said. “So, at this point, I would call them extrajudicial killings. “This is akin to what China does, to [what] Iran does with drug dealers; they summarily execute people without providing evidence to the public, so it’s wrong,” Paul said. Both Iran and China have been known to secretly execute drug dealers, without providing due process. Paul, a Libertarian, has been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration’s policy on the strikes, pointing to the military’s likely illegal drones, as well as the statistical likelihood that some of its targets are mistaken. The U.S. conducted its tenth strike on a foreign vessel on Friday, killing another six people without providing any actual evidence linking the boats to any drug cartel. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed the ship was operated by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. Trump also ordered an aircraft carrier strike group to the Caribbean, in a major escalation of military tension between the U.S. and Venezuela. Last week, Trump stated his intention to expand his lawless strikes to dry land—bragging that Congress wouldn’t stop him. Donald Trump’s latest doctor visit turned out to be a fairly serious medical evaluation. The president stopped by Walter Reed Medical Center earlier this month, but the president’s team refused for days to explain why. Apparently it was for MRI scans, a medical tool typically used to assess tumors, joint injuries, or heart conditions. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Monday, Trump claimed the visit was little more than a “routine yearly checkup”—despite the fact that he had his annual physical just six months ago. “I got an MRI,” he said before touching down in Japan. “It was perfect.” The president did not elaborate on what the doctors were looking for or what they had found, though the 79-year-old did emphasize that the doctors allegedly told him he had “some of the best reports” they had ever seen. “You can ask the doctors,” he said. “Nobody has ever given you reports like I give you.” Trump then went on to brag about his IQ, claiming that “aptitude tests” he received at Walter Reed proved he was superior to his political opponents—especially compared to a couple of healthy young women. “You give her an IQ test. Have her pass, like, the exams that I decided to take when I was at Walter Reed,” Trump said referring to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “I took—those are very hard—they’re really aptitude tests, I guess, in a certain way.” Trump also derided Texas Representative Jasmine Crockett, suggesting that she too should grapple with the “very hard” tests, which he said included questions about “tigers, an elephant, a giraffe.” It’s unclear what test this could be referring to, but it sounds remarkably similar to Trump’s infamous “person, woman, man, camera, TV” test—which health experts have revealed is a test to check for signs of dementia, Alzheimer’s, or other cognitive issues. The White House said that the president was in “excellent overall health” after his October 10 visit, referring to the testing as “advanced imaging.” Press secretary Karoline Leavitt refused to clarify that language during a White House press briefing last week, rejecting a reporter’s query as to whether that meant Trump had received MRI scans. “Advanced imaging is something that presidents receive and people receive when they go to the doctor, and so we provided a detailed readout of that physical, and I would encourage you back for that,” she said. When pressed again on the matter, Leavitt said: “I don’t know the exact imaging that took place, but as the physician’s note said, the president is in incredibly good shape and I think that’s evidenced here every single day.” Trump’s health has been a topic of concern since he was on the campaign trail, when reports circulated that he couldn’t remember the contents of the cognitive exams he claimed to ace. Since then, the president has been spotted with odd discolorations on his hand, routinely appears discombobulated and lethargic during critical meetings with world leaders, and had a drooping expression during 9/11 ceremonies in September that onlookers suggested could be a sign of a stroke. It looks like President Donald Trump’s family is once again using the White House as a personal piggy bank. A Florida-based drone manufacturer linked to Don Trump Jr. just received its largest ever contract to supply parts to the Pentagon, the Financial Times reported Friday. Unusual Machines, a company that builds and sells drones, said that the U.S. Army had contracted it to make 3,500 drone motors, among other parts, and the Pentagon indicated that it would order an additional 20,000 components in 2026. CEO Allen Evans said that he believed it was the largest order the company had ever received from the U.S. government, but he did not disclose the value of the contract. The Defense Department appears to have stopped posting daily contract notices since the government shutdown began on October 1. Trump Jr. joined the company’s advisory board in November 2024, shortly after his father became commander in chief of the U.S. military. Trump Jr. previously disclosed that he owned a roughly $4 million stake in the company, although it’s unclear whether he has retained his shares. Earlier this month, Evans told Bloomberg that the president’s son had continued to participate in fundraising rounds. There are obvious conflicts of interest that surround the president’s son being positioned to profit off the defense industry—and the Trump administration has already done plenty to pave the way for buying more American-made drones. In June, Trump signed an executive order to “unleash American drone dominance,” and in July, the Pentagon removed restrictions in order to accelerate drone procurement. Trump Jr.’s involvement immediately boosted Unusual Machines’ beleaguered stock, and Evans said that the first son’s public endorsement made it easier to get meetings with potential partners, allowing the company to raise more than $80 million from investors this year. But Evans insisted that Trump Jr. wasn’t involved in the massive deal, and a spokesperson for Trump Jr. said that “Don has never communicated with anyone in the administration on behalf of Unusual Machines or about the contract in question.” The president’s family has pocketed more than $1.8 billion in cash and gifts since Trump’s return to the White House, according to the Center for American Progress. That figure includes more than $1.2 billion from their cryptocurrency side hustle. On Thursday, Trump pardoned the founder of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, who helped launch his family’s cryptocurrency platform, World Liberty Financial, with a massive $2 billion favor for its stablecoin. The ballroom replacing the White House East Wing will share Donald Trump’s name. The $300 million project has yet to receive a formal designation, but it is already being referred to as the “President Donald J. Trump Ballroom,” a moniker that will likely stick, senior administration officials told ABC News Friday. Practically every detail that has emerged about the ballroom—and the East Wing’s complete destruction this week—has been uncovered by media outlets that refused to take the administration’s plan at face value. After promising Americans in July that his ballroom proposal would “be near but not touching” the historic building, Trump plowed ahead without prerequisite approval from the National Capital Planning Commission (which has been closed since the government shutdown began earlier this month) and without the express permission of Congress. The project’s price tag also inexplicably grew by 50 percent over the last week. What Trump had pitched as a $200 million project was instead referred to this week as a $300 million development plan that the White House suggested would be funded, in part, by some of the country’s wealthiest families and biggest corporations, including the likes of Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. Government officials are still trying to ascertain whether Trump’s sudden, unauthorized decision to demolish the White House was legal, but at least two Americans have already opted to sue him over it in an attempt to suspend the construction. The White House’s partial destruction is, ultimately, another illustration that the country’s constitutional system of checks and balances has eroded. The international real estate mogul’s desire to destroy the government—and with it, the architectural face of American democracy—has received practically zero pushback from his allies in Congress, who appear all too willing to sit back as Trump courts billionaires to fund his golden banquet hall. Resisting Trump’s drafts for the East Wing would require someone in power to actually hold the president accountable. But his desire to destroy and redevelop the White House as he sees fit should come as no surprise, since he’s never appeared to be a fan of the national symbol. During his first term, Trump reportedly called the White House “a dump” (an allegation that he has publicly refuted), and he has spent no small part of his second term living and dining at his own properties rather than the executive mansion.

Title: Answerman - Are Subtitles Getting Smaller?
URL: https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2025-10-27/.230367
Time Published: 2025-10-27T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
A Reader asks: No, it's not your eyes. I have often thought the same thing, after my own traumatic experience managing the UK home video campaign of Evangelion: 3.33: You (Cannot) Release. Sorry! What? That's not the film's real title? You could've fooled me. That particular anime release was delayed by almost two years as Studio Khara insisted on supervising the re-recording of the English dub and the re-translation of the original Japanese audio and subtitles. A process they directly oversaw, which resulted in the DVD and Blu-ray release containing two "studio-approved" subtitle options. I remember one of the subtitle streams being so wordy that I thought they had to reduce the font size to fit it all on screen. As a regular anime viewer, I am not surprised to receive this question. Anime fans are a particular species when it comes to attention to detail, and subtitling is actually one of the major impediments to enjoying the medium if you cannot speak or understand Japanese. When it comes to the quality of subtitling, all is not as it may seem at first, especially if you're a Crunchyroll subscriber watching the Fall 2025 season. But we'll get to that crisis in a moment. First, let's address your main concern about whether subtitles are actually getting smaller. The Technical Answer: Your TV Is Lying To You Good news! Dr. ANSWERMAN has run some checks, and I am pleased to inform you that you haven't contracted syphilis or any of the hundreds of serious infections that can lead to permanent loss of sight. I've done the research, and it isn't you; it's your Smart TV. According to subtitle experts, standard font sizes have not, in fact, been getting smaller; however, display resolution and pixel density have been increasing dramatically over time. What this means in practice is that the higher your TV's resolution, the smaller the font size will appear, even though the actual point size hasn't changed. A subtitle that looks perfectly readable on a 1080p display can seem tiny on a 4K screen with the same physical dimensions. Higher pixel densities can help alleviate this challenge, but as we're about to discuss, don't rely on Crunchyroll to rise to that challenge. There's a reason "Subs" always won during the great Anime Wars of the early 2000s, whenever the "Subs Versus Dubs" debate would reignite over tequila-soaked trestle tables at regional anime conventions and on messageboards around the early social media landscape. The answer? Fansubs and Home Video Standards. DVDs and Blu-rays were the primary means of distributing and delivering a premium anime viewing experience to fans. Physical media traditionally featured larger, more readable subtitles with full closed captioning, superior typesetting, and careful attention to on-screen text translation. If you watch Anime A on Blu-ray or DVD, the subtitle font genuinely does appear larger on screen than it does on a Crunchyroll or Netflix stream. However! My simply writing anything complimentary about the subtitle quality on commercial Blu-rays has likely marked me for death. Many of the OG fansubbers pride themselves on their subtitling skills and the overall quality of their work. The fansub community developed incredibly sophisticated techniques for subtitle presentation, using tools and formats that went far beyond what commercial releases offered at the time. “Your S.R.T. can kiss my A.S.S.” This topic has taken me down wormholes I never wanted to visit. Take this one, for example: even fansubbers and professional subtitlers can't agree on what is the best software, file format, or font for subtitling. Many subbers swear by ASS (Advanced SubStation Alpha) format and believe it should be the anime industry standard because it allows for custom fonts, colors, text positioning, and animation effects. ASS enables multiple speakers to be displayed simultaneously in different positions on screen, on-screen text to be translated and positioned exactly where it appears in the scene, and visual styling that makes subtitles feel integrated into the viewing experience rather than slapped on top. By contrast, SRT (SubRip) is a simple, plain-text subtitle format; no styling, no positioning, just text and timecodes. It's the universal standard used by Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and nearly every streaming service. It's simpler to produce, easier to scale across platforms, and compatible with every device under the sun. It's also, unfortunately, what Crunchyroll has switched to for their Fall 2025 season. The tool that made ASS subtitles possible for Crunchyroll was Aegisub - a free, open-source, cross-platform application for creating and editing subtitles. Originally developed for fansubbing, Aegisub became the professional standard for anime localization because of its advanced features and customization options. Users can translate, time, and style subtitles using powerful tools, then export them in various formats. It was Crunchyroll's secret weapon, the tool that let them deliver fansub-quality subtitles at a commercial scale. One thing that the recent subtitling crisis reveals is that Sony seems to be moving away from using the Aegisub system preferred by fansubbers and Crunchyroll's original production and operations team since the platform's inception. And one has to wonder if that is a wise move for the world's favorite anime streamer? Crisis on Infinite Subtitles! When I started writing this column, it was going to be a short and sweet explanation about high-resolution LED TV screens and monitors, but the events of the past few weeks could not go without comment. According to Anime By The Numbers, there's been a noticeable downgrade in typesetting and visual quality for the new Fall 2025 anime simulcast. The first episode of My Hero Academia: Final Season launched without any English language option. SPY x FAMILY Season 3 was delayed by hours. Multiple shows launched late, some with no subtitles at all, others with only Portuguese or Thai options. As of writing, many of these issues seem to have been rectified, but not before Reddit user mudda-hello documented the changes, including Crunchyroll's signature typesetting. Multiple overlapping speakers were no longer represented at different positions on screen. The bold fonts with colored strokes designed for visual clarity had vanished. On-screen text was either untranslated or stacked clumsily on top of dialogue. Imagine watching an anime where a character holds up a sign with crucial plot information. Previously, that text would be translated and positioned right on the sign. Now? The translation appears as generic white text at the bottom, completely covering the character's dialogue happening simultaneously. You have to choose: read the sign or read what they're saying. You can't have both. What Actually Happened While Crunchyroll's official statement blames "internal system problems," leaked reports paint a very different picture. According to sources, the majority of Crunchyroll's subtitling staff had been using Aegisub, the open-source software beloved by the fansubbing community. Recently, however, everyone was forced to abandon it and switch to cloud-based software called OOONA, a complete, proprietary system developed by an Israeli company. Many staff members were reportedly very upset about the decision, particularly coming so soon after major layoffs in August that gutted the localization and operations teams. It is important to point out that OONA is fast-becoming an industry favorite. Global production and digital broadcasting behemoth, ITV (Love Island), has recently integrated it because it is a robust industry-grade tool for managing large volumes of subtitles. David Padmore, ITV's Director of Accessibility, commented: “We chose OOONA because the team really understands our access services and localization workflows, and the platform supports these off the shelf.” Padmore also emphasized that OOONA lets ITV “make good use of AI and automation developments within a secure environment” as part of improving their production processes. However! ITV is not a global anime streaming platform, and one could fairly argue that the type of programming they deliver, reality formats, scripted dramas, game shows, etc, does not require the same level of bespoke subtitling that each anime series does. OOONA, founded in 2012 and headquartered in Tel Aviv, specializes in cloud-based software for translation and localization. It's also used by Netflix and Disney+, services that have never prioritized anime-specific subtitle styling. The software reportedly uses AI tools for various tasks like speech editing and video localization, though Crunchyroll has not confirmed its use of OOONA and denies any changes to its subtitle creation process. The timing is damning. The August layoffs included some of Crunchyroll's longest-serving employees, people who had been with the company since its fansub roots, who understood why anime subtitling requires special attention. Then, right as the fall season launches, arguably the biggest anime season of 2025, with the final season of My Hero Academia, SPY x FAMILY Season 3, and One Punch Man Season 3, things fall apart. Crunchyroll's official response to Anime News Network stated: "Over the past few days, some users experienced delays in accessing the content they wanted and subtitle issues across certain series. These were caused by internal system problems, not by any change in how we create subtitles, use of new vendors, or AI. Those internal issues have now been fully resolved." The community isn't buying it. When Reddit users contacted customer support, they received similarly vague responses about "technical and software issues" causing subtitles to "appear differently," with assurances that this "was not an intentional downgrade." After massive fan backlash, Crunchyroll reverted the subtitle font to their previous style, suggesting this wasn't a bug at all, but a deliberate change that they subsequently walked back when the outcry became too loud. Proper typesetting is crucial for deaf and hard-of-hearing fans, as well as viewers with visual impairments. Crunchyroll's previous subtitle style used bold fonts with colored strokes specifically for visual clarity. The new generic white text is significantly harder to read. This comes after Crunchyroll's ongoing failure to provide closed captioning for most English dubs, a problem that's persisted for years despite competitors offering CC as standard. When Crunchyroll absorbed Funimation, many English dubs that previously had closed captions lost them. For over a decade, Crunchyroll used subtitle formats that let translators be creative with how text appeared on screen. On-screen signs blended naturally into scenes. Text messages showed up translated where they belonged. Multiple speakers could be tracked easily. It made the shows better to watch, and for a moment, that was all gone. Reincarnated as a Streaming Service: I Have Overpowered Market Share, But My Subtitles Are Trash It's easy to dump on The Man, but from a purely business perspective, Crunchyroll might actually be making the "right" decision. Even though it hurts fans. Crunchyroll doesn't just stream anime directly to subscribers anymore. They sub-license major titles to Netflix (Solo Leveling, Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle), Disney+ (My Hero Academia), and other platforms. They're available as a channel through Amazon Prime Video and YouTube TV. All of these distribution partners require standardized subtitle formats that work across dozens of different apps, devices, and platforms. In some of their fastest-growing markets, the app is distributed via Netflix and Disney+, which aren't going to accommodate Crunchyroll's special ASS format files. They want industry-standard SRT that slots seamlessly into their existing infrastructure. Additionally, Crunchyroll is rapidly expanding into new international markets like Brazil, Mexico, India, and Indonesia, where they need to produce subtitles in multiple languages simultaneously. From an operations perspective, standardizing on the same tools and formats that every other streaming service uses makes scaling much easier and cheaper. But Crunchyroll isn't like any other streaming service, and its subscribers aren't like any other media consumer. They're supposed to be the anime-first platform, the one that understands what makes this medium special. As one industry analyst noted, "If Crunchyroll stops doing typesetting work, for most anime, it will simply cease to exist. The viewing experience for the typical anime fan will go down." With anime making up just 4-5% of Netflix's total viewership and an even smaller share of Hulu, Disney+, and Prime Video, those platforms will never optimize the viewing experience for anime. They can't justify the investment. But Crunchyroll's entire business model is built on being the definitive anime platform. When they abandon what made them special, what's left? Understandably, Sony might stumble while rapidly scaling into new markets that lack decades of anime localization infrastructure, but it isn't as if they didn't acquire almost every single successful Western anime distribution business of the past 30 years, either. Surely! They have the largest international braintrust for the global anime distribution and monetisation at their disposal. Don't they? Where have all of their anime experts gone? What Sony seems to misunderstand is that selling anime to anime fans is not like other tech-based product services. They are detail-oriented people. They notice when fonts change. They care about on-screen text translation. They built the fansub community that Crunchyroll originally displaced. And yes, they can be pernickety pains in the ass, but you can't treat them like passive Netflix consumers. The subtitle crisis of Fall 2025 is about more than typesetting. It's about whether the world's dominant anime streaming platform will honor the community that built it, or whether, as with so many tech platforms before it, growth and profit will trump everything else.

Dublin pub group Grand Slam Bars saw pretax profits nearly double to €983,000, as revenues grew following the group’s midyear acquisition of McSorley’s in Ranelagh. In newly filed financial accounts, the group said its performance “has continued to improve year on year” noting that turnover has increased from €9.4 million to €11.3 million. The bar group is owned by Noel Anderson, the former chairman of the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA), along with four former Irish international rugby players Jamie Heaslip, Sean O’Brien, and the Kearney brothers Rob and Dave. Grand Slam Bars owns the Bridge bar in Ballsbridge, the Blackrock in the south Dublin suburb of the same name and the Lemon & Duke and Little Lemon in the city centre. During the financial year, it bought McSorley’s pub in Ranelagh, Dublin 6, for €5.5 million. The majority of the group’s turnover – €7.3 million, or around two-thirds of revenue – was generated from the sale of alcoholic drinks. This represented a significant increase on drinks sales in the previous year at €5.75 million. Food sales also increased, up marginally to €3.8 million, alongside tea and coffee sales which rose from €44,000 to €133,000. The group saw pretax profits increase by 90 per cent from €518,000 in the financial year ending in February 2024 to just over €983,000 this past year. The group’s assets have risen to €14.6 million from just over €8 million in 2024. Buoyed by the acquisition of McSorley’s pub, the company had an average of 153 employees, an increase of 16 jobs on the previous year. Staff costs also rose to just over €4.1 million from nearly €3.8 million. Borrowings at the firm are up from €2.1 million in 2024 to €7.28 million with a mortgage, which is secured against the group’s pubs, having been added to the company. The former international rugby player investors in the group serve as directors on its subsidiary firms and directors “ambassador fees” during the year came to €55,000. Mr Anderson is also a shareholder in the Changing Times Brewery, which is making local stout and lager, which owed the group early €150,000 at year end.

Title: Standard Chartered Says This Could Be the Week Everything Changes for Bitcoin | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee because this week could quietly redefine the tone of the entire market. Between shifting US-China trade winds, a looming Fed decision, and Bitcoin’s tightening grip above six figures, the mood feels different — almost expectant. This could be one of those weeks where the market quietly shifts from uncertainty to conviction. According to Standard Chartered’s Head of Digital Assets Research, Geoff Kendrick, a wave of surprisingly positive US-China developments has turned market sentiment “from fear into hope.” Kendrick highlighted that US Treasury Secretary Bessent signaled an imminent breakthrough over the weekend. He indicated that China is expected to suspend rare earth export controls for a year and increase soybean purchases from the US in exchange for Washington dropping its threatened 100% tariffs. Details of this potential deal will be finalized after the Trump-Xi meeting in Korea later this week. The news has already rippled through the markets, with Bitcoin benefiting from the positive sentiment. In the same tone, the USD-CNH pair has fallen to near year-to-date lows, signaling a stronger yuan and renewed confidence in global trade stability. This easing tension has, in turn, fueled a rebound in Bitcoin’s correlation to risk appetite, as investors rotate away from defensive positions. “The Bitcoin-gold ratio, highlighted last week, continues to push higher,” Kendrick wrote, noting that it now sits just above levels seen before the tariff scare earlier this month. “I’ll watch for this ratio to break back above 30 to signal an end to such fear.” For Kendrick, the coming days may mark a critical turning point for Bitcoin and how investors interpret its long-term cycle. He pointed out that over $2 billion exited US gold ETFs last week, suggesting an appetite shift that could soon favor Bitcoin. “It would confirm a more positive backdrop if even half of that re-entered Bitcoin ETFs early this week,” he noted. The broader setup looks equally intriguing. Wednesday’s FOMC meeting is expected to deliver a 25 basis-point rate cut, despite the Fed operating in what Kendrick described as a “data blackout.” It's FOMC week!There's a 96.7% chance the Fed will cut interest rates by 25bps. What’s your prediction? pic.twitter.com/SRVPczDYcL He also hinted that growing speculation over the next Fed Chair could prove “Bitcoin positive” if it raises concerns about central bank independence. Add to that, the looming earnings releases from five of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ — Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple, and Amazon — and the macro calendar looks loaded with catalysts. “This week is about to be pure chaos…the government shutdown is about to hit day 30. The Fed decides rates on Wednesday. Powell speaks right after, during a data blackout. Then, we’ve got Microsoft, Apple, Google, Meta, and Amazon, all reporting earnings. That’s $15.2 trillion in market cap dropping numbers in the same week. And just when you think it’s over… Trump meets President Xi on Thursday, 48 hours before his 100% tariff deadline. Buckle up. This week could move everything,” Mario Nawfal corroborated. Kendrick argues that a fresh Bitcoin all-time high would serve as the “death knell” for those still clinging to the halving cycle as the primary driver of BTC’s value. “ETF flows matter more now…If this week goes well, Bitcoin may never go below $100,000 again,” he said. This statement echoes remarks highlighted in a recent US Crypto News publication. Whether or not that prediction holds, this week’s mix of diplomacy, data, and digital gold could prove decisive for the next phase of Bitcoin’s story.

VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- USA News GroupNews Commentary – Gold prices held above $4,100 per ounce through late October 2025, extending a year that has delivered over 25% gains since January and positioned the precious metal for its strongest annual performance since 1979[1]. This sustained rally at elevated levels drove mining profit margins to unprecedented territory[2], with producers seeing margins effectively double as operational costs remain relatively stable while gold continues to commands prices above $4,000 per ounce. Against this backdrop of record bullion values and enhanced economics, exploration and development companies across multiple jurisdictions are accelerating programs, among them Lake Victoria Gold (TSXV: LVG) (OTCQB: LVGLF), First Mining Gold Corp. (TSX: FF) (OTCQX: FFMGF), Andean Precious Metals Corp. (TSX: APM) (OTCQX: ANPMF), U.S. GoldMining Inc. (NASDAQ: USGO), and Nova Minerals Limited (NASDAQ: NVA). Bank of America raised its 2026 gold forecast to $5,000 per ounce, citing unorthodox fiscal policies and rising debt levels as persistent tailwinds for the metal[3]. Meanwhile, JPMorgan projects prices averaging $3,675 per ounce by Q4 2025 before climbing toward $4,000 by mid-2026[4], with sustained central bank purchasing and investor demand averaging 710 tonnes quarterly underpinning the forecast, creating compelling timing advantages for companies advancing high-grade projects toward production. Lake Victoria Gold (TSXV: LVG) (OTCQB: LVGLF) has reported continued exploration success at its Tembo-area licences, where Barrick Gold's Bulyanhulu joint venture completed 12 reverse-circulation holes totaling 1,380 metres during Q2 2025. The results confirm the geological continuity between Barrick's flagship Tanzanian mine and LVG's 100%-owned adjacent ground. "Barrick's methodical exploration is confirming the geological architecture we've interpreted on our licence area," said Marc Cernovitch, President and CEO of LVG. "As they advance, LVG benefits from both the direct geological insights and the potential for substantial contingent payments—creating a rare opportunity of value addition through a combination of near-term potential production development at Imwelo and the Tembo project, and discovery leverage through the Buly exploration." The Q2 drilling confirmed favorable geology, intersecting mafic metavolcanics (greenstone) and quartz porphyry dykes, which display weak to moderate deformation and have associated silica-sericite alteration, and localized disseminated pyrite and quartz veining—promising indicators for gold mineralization in this highly productive district. Rock-chip samples from artisanal workings near zones of strong chlorite-sericite alteration, indicate the presence of potentially mineralized structures. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement executed in 2022, LVG may receive up to US $45 million in contingent payments from Barrick, subject to future discoveries or defined resource thresholds on these licences. The results reinforce the geological continuity between the Bulyanhulu Mine and the Tembo Project area, validating LVG's long-standing interpretation of the belt's broader potential. "We are encouraged to see Barrick's sustained exploration momentum and technical validation across the Tembo-area licences," said Simon Benstead, Executive Chairman and CFO of Lake Victoria Gold. "Their work continues to confirm the fertility of this part of the Lake Victoria Goldfields, where LVG remains a significant stakeholder through both our adjacent 100%-owned Tembo Project and the contingent upside tied to future discoveries." This strategic exposure comes as LVG accelerates its fully permitted Imwelo Gold Project toward construction. The company recently commenced drilling at Area C, the highest-grade zone within the project located just 12 kilometers from AngloGold Ashanti's flagship Geita mine. The approximately 24-hole, 4,000-metre program at Area C is designed to finalize pit design, strengthen resource confidence, and test for extensions at what management views as the priority starting point for mining. Previous drilling at Area C has returned high-grade results, including 6.8 metres at 14.6 g/t gold from 32 metres and 2.0 metres at 7.5 g/t from 22 metres, confirming strong production potential. The drill mobilization follows LVGachieving a pivotal agreement in principle with the Government of Tanzania on the government's statutory minimum 16% free carried interest. This fulfills a core regulatory condition. Together with environmental approval of the Updated Environmental and Social Management Plan, the regulatory pathway is now cleared for construction advancement. Imwelo operates under a 10-year renewable mining license with metallurgical recoveries surpassing 90%. This translates to an exceptional 90 cents of recoverable value per dollar of contained gold. Critically, Lake Victoria Gold is targeting first gold within 12 months of breaking ground. Financial momentum accelerated in September as LVGofficially closed an oversubscribed $6 million financing alongside a $2 million concurrent private placement. Proceeds fund work programs satisfying conditions for a pre-paid forward purchase facility with Monetary Metals to finance mine construction capital. Beyond Imwelo, the Tembo Project delivers additional optionality. A planned 3,000m drilling program at Ngula 1 is scheduled, where historical intercepts of 28.57 g/t gold over 3 metres signal toll milling opportunity. The timing proves strategic. Lake Victoria Gold is mobilizing equipment at a fully permitted project in one of Africa's premier gold districts precisely when high-grade ounces command maximum value.

(TSX: FF) (OTCQX: FFMGF) is expanding its newly discovered Miroir target at its Duparquet Gold Project in Quebec's Abitibi region, with drill hole DUP25-064 returning 3.23 g/t Au over 25.9 m, including 11.20 g/t Au over 2.0 m and 10.16 g/t Au over 1.4 m. The company has completed approximately 16,000 m of drilling in 2025, with 20 holes totaling ~4,450 m at Miroir alone, extending mineralization to 100 m depth while expanding the interpreted geophysical fold target to a 140 m strike length. "The Miroir target continues to deliver new discoveries within the largely underexplored volcanic setting of the Duparquet Project," stated Dan Wilton, CEO of First Mining. "The strong grades and widths encountered to date provide new and exciting opportunities in our review of development scenarios that can now include near-surface, higher grade mineralization potential." Drilling at Miroir follows initial discovery hole DUP24-048, which returned 3.12 g/t Au over 19.35 m in 2024, with recent step-out hole DUP25-066 delivering 1.37 g/t Au over 30.6 m approximately 45 m east of the headline intercept. The Duparquet Project currently hosts 3.44 million ounces Au in the Measured & Indicated category at 1.55 g/t, plus 2.64 million ounces Inferred at 1.62 g/t across a 19 km strike along the prolific Destor-Porcupine Fault Zone. Andean Precious Metals Corp. (TSX: APM) (OTCQX: ANPMF) has expanded its 2025 exploration program at Golden Queen by an additional 3,800 metres following positive Phase 3 drilling results, with core holes at Hilltop intersecting 1.94 g/t Au and 27 g/t Ag over 4.4 m and 5.11 g/t Au and 11 g/t Ag over 1.5 m, bringing total planned 2025 drilling to 8,100 metres. At San Bartolome in Bolivia, the company has secured environmental exploration permits and social licenses in partnership with COMIBOL under a long-term agreement to purchase up to 7.0 million tonnes of oxide ore, with 5,500 metres of shallow core drilling set to begin in Q4 2025 targeting approximately 800,000 tonnes grading 150-250 g/t Ag across multiple projects including Turqui, Tacobamba, Ánimas, Santa Isabel, and Trapiche. "Our exploration teams have made strong progress this year at both Golden Queen and San Bartolome," said Yohann Bouchard, President of Andean Precious Metals. "At Golden Queen, Phase 3 drilling has intersected encouraging mineralized intervals that confirm continuity and support potential mine-life extensions, while upcoming infill work at the Starlight Vein is designed to further expand Main Pit 2. In Bolivia, our partnership with COMIBOL is advancing multiple targets under a long-term ore supply agreement that secures access to up to 7 million tonnes of oxide ore. This program is designed to extend San Bartolome's mine life and maximize throughput of the existing 5,000 tpd mill without major capital spend." The Golden Queen program has drilled 3,903 metres across 20 core holes at Hilltop to date, with all holes intersecting projected low-sulfidation cryptocrystalline quartz veins that extend mineralization up to 280 metres along strike, while infill drilling at the Starlight Vein will support expansion of Main Pit 2, which is currently in production. The company anticipates releasing an updated mineral resource and reserve statement with supporting NI 43-101 technical report in the first half of 2026, integrating new geological data from the expanded drilling program that collectively positions Andean as a growing Americas-focused precious metals producer with quality assets across its California and Bolivia operations. U.S. GoldMining Inc. (NASDAQ: USGO) has successfully completed its 2025 exploration program at the Whistler Gold-Copper Project in Alaska, executing 169 scout auger drill holes across the 7.5 km by 4.5 km Whistler Orbit and completing systematic mapping and sampling at the Muddy Creek intrusion-related gold system. The program identified multiple new porphyry intrusive occurrences at top-of-bedrock and determined that much of the till overburden is shallower than previously interpreted, positioning drill-ready targets closer to surface across the 514 km² property located 150 km northwest of Anchorage. "We are pleased to have successfully completed our 2025 exploration program at the Whistler Project in line with our objective to develop a pipeline of targets for potential future discoveries that will underpin growth opportunities for the Project," said Tim Smith, Chief Executive Officer of U.S. GoldMining. "We also welcome the recent U.S. Federal decision to approve the Ambler Road in north central Alaska, which further supports our belief that the prevailing political tailwinds at all levels of government will help to expedite the successful permitting and ultimate development of the proposed West Susitna Access Road, which is expected to connect the Company's 100% owned Whistler Gold-Copper Project to transportation infrastructure near Anchorage, Alaska." The Whistler Project contains over 20 advanced gold and copper prospects including the Whistler and Raintree deposits, which host a combined mineral resource estimate of 294 Mt at 0.68 g/t AuEq for 6.48 Moz AuEq Indicated, plus 198 Mt at 0.65 g/t AuEq for 4.16 Moz AuEq Inferred. Mapping at Muddy Creek identified new zones of increased quartz vein density containing abundant to massive sulphides including antimony-bearing minerals, with 106 rock grab samples and 7 silt samples collected across a 5 km by 2.5 km area, with assays pending from both the Whistler Orbit scout drilling program and Muddy Creek surface sampling. Nova Minerals Limited (NASDAQ: NVA) has been engaged by Australian Ambassador to the United States, His Excellency The Hon Dr Kevin Rudd AC, to provide a comprehensive briefing on its Estelle Gold and Critical Minerals Project ahead of the October 20, 2025 meeting between Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington DC. The briefing follows the company's recent US$43.4 million award from the U.S. Department of War to accelerate development of a fully integrated U.S. antimony supply chain, targeting military-spec antimony production by 2026/27, with the Estelle Project's 514 km² land package hosting over 20 advanced gold and antimony prospects across a 35 km mineralized corridor in Alaska's Tintina Gold Belt. "Being invited to brief the Australian Government for this high-level meeting between Prime Minister Albanese and President Trump is a testament to the strategic importance of the Estelle Project," said Christopher Gerteisen, CEO of Nova Minerals. "With antimony recognized as a critical mineral and our gold resources adding significant value, Nova is well-positioned to contribute to both U.S. and Australian critical minerals strategies. The US$43.4 million DoW award and our secured land at Port MacKenzie underscore our commitment to building a secure, domestic supply chain for antimony and supporting U.S. defense and industrial needs." The company's proposed antimony refinery at Port MacKenzie, supported by a secured 42.81-acre land use permit, will produce antimony trisulfide, antimony trioxide, and antimony metal for military and industrial applications. Nova's strategic positioning has been reinforced by antimony's inclusion on the U.S. Department of the Interior's Draft 2025 Critical Minerals List and the recent U.S. Federal Government approval of the Ambler Road, signaling increased policy support for responsible resource development in Alaska and alignment with the proposed West Susitna Access Road that would connect the Estelle Project to transportation infrastructure near Anchorage.

Title: Time To Book Profits In CRWD Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/27/time-to-book-profits-in-crwd-stock/
Time Published: 2025-10-27T13:38:16Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CrowdStrike stock (NASDAQ: CRWD) has experienced an impressive performance, increasing by 10% in just the last week and hitting a peak of $522 on October 23, 2025. This surge has brought its year-to-date gains to an impressive 50%. The recent upward trend is primarily due to a series of analyst upgrades and increased price targets. This favorable sentiment follows the company's robust performance and strategic developments showcased at its recent Fal.Con event in September. With the stock currently valued around $520, investors are enjoying significant gains. The key question now is: After this remarkable rise, is CRWD stock still a worthwhile buy? While there are minimal fundamental concerns regarding CRWD stock, we view it as a costly choice at its current trade price of approximately $520. The major concern is that its current valuation seems very high. We arrived at this conclusion by comparing CRWD's present valuation with its operating performance over the past few years and its current and historical financial conditions. Our examination of CrowdStrike across essential metrics—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—indicates that the company maintains a strong operating performance and financial situation, as elaborated below. That said, if you are looking for upside with reduced volatility than holding an individual stock like CRWD, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a mixture of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns exceeding 105% since inception. Why is this the case? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with less risk than the benchmark index; providing less of a roller-coaster experience, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Let’s confront the obvious issue first – valuation. When evaluating the price per dollar of sales or cash flow, CrowdStrike appears extraordinarily expensive. These ratios imply that investors are paying a substantial premium for anticipated growth. The question arises whether that growth can warrant such elevated valuations. Here’s where the narrative takes an intriguing turn. CrowdStrike's revenue growth has been nothing less than impressive, making a strong argument for why investors might accept those elevated multiples. This persistent high-growth trajectory in the crucial cybersecurity sector indicates that CrowdStrike has discovered a successful model. The company continues to outpace the wider market significantly. This is where CrowdStrike's story becomes more intricate. In spite of remarkable revenue growth, conventional profitability metrics reveal a troubling situation. This contrast suggests that CrowdStrike is investing heavily in growth while generating solid cash flows. The company seems to be focusing on expanding market share over immediate profitability. Despite challenges to profitability, CrowdStrike's balance sheet is robust and offers essential flexibility for its growth strategy. What contributes to the strength of the balance sheet? The financial stability metrics are outstanding: This financial robustness enables CrowdStrike to persist with aggressive investments without being concerned about funding limitations. Assessing CrowdStrike's performance during downturns aids in understanding its resilience as a long-term investment. CrowdStrike tends to undergo more dramatic fluctuations but demonstrates substantial recovery capacity, likely due to the vital role of cybersecurity services. Check out our dashboard on – How Low Can CRWD Stock Really Go – for more information. Additionally, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stock benchmark (the combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is this? The quarterly rebalanced mixture of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided a proactive method to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during downturns, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics. CrowdStrike poses a classic conflict between growth and value. The company merges outstanding growth with robust financial stability, categorizing it as a high-quality business. However, its current valuation around $520 seems excessive, even for a firm with such remarkable fundamentals. Naturally, we could be mistaken in our evaluation, and investors might continue to be willing to pay 30 times or more for CRWD stock revenues. Nonetheless, investors should also consider the associated risks. We believe that waiting for a more favorable entry point may be the better option, as the existing price seems to reflect a lot of anticipated future success.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Shopify (SHOP) shares have surged 21% in the last month and are currently priced at $172.95. Our algorithm-based multi-factor evaluation indicates that it may be advisable to lower exposure to SHOP shares at this time. Our main concern lies in the current valuation, as a price point of $121 may not be unattainable. We believe there is minimal risk in SHOP stock given its overall Strong operational performance and financial standing. However, due to its Very High valuation, the stock seems Relatively Expensive. Here is our analysis: SHOP stock has increased significantly lately, making it appear relatively expensive at this time. Although this might seem like a chance, there are substantial risks associated with investing in a single stock. Conversely, a broader diversified strategy, as practiced with Trefis High Quality Portfolio, offers considerable value. Additionally, contemplate how the long-term performance of your portfolio could be enhanced by including 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities. Let’s delve into the details of each of the factors evaluated, but first, for a quick overview: With a market capitalization of $224 Bil, Shopify delivers a global commerce platform that enables merchants to showcase, manage, promote, and sell products across various sales channels. This table illustrates how SHOP is growing in comparison to the broader market. For further details see: SHOP Revenue Comparison This table illustrates how SHOP's profitability compares against the broader market. For more details see: SHOP Operating Income Comparison SHOP has performed worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. This assessment takes into account both (a) the magnitude of the stock's decline and, (b) the speed of its recovery. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 Covid Pandemic However, the risks are not confined to significant market crashes. Stocks can decline even during favorable market conditions—consider events such as earnings announcements, business updates, and outlook changes. Review SHOP Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming benchmarks that include all three—S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is this the case? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; it has been a smoother ride, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are pointing to a sharply higher open this morning after major indexes closed last week at record highs; investor sentiment is getting a boost after President Donald Trump said he was optimistic the U.S. would reach a trade deal with China and address ownership of social media app TikTok; Avidity Biosciences (RNA) shares are surging after Swiss pharmaceutical maker Novartis (NVS) said it would acquire the biotechnology firm; and U.S.-listed shares of Argentine companies are soaring after President Javier Milei’s political party posted victories in legislative elections there. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are higher this morning amid optimism about an apparent easing of trade tensions between the U.S. and China, while investors prepare for an expected rate cut by the Federal Reserve and a flurry of earnings reports from major technology companies later in the week. The three major U.S. stock indexes come into today's session at record highs after each gained about 2% last week following a mild inflation report that reaffirmed expectations that the Fed will cut its key rate on Wednesday. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.5% recently, while those linked to the the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.9% and 1.3%, respectively. Bitcoin was trading at $115,400, up from a low over the weekend around $111,000. Gold futures were down 2.6% at $4,030 an ounce, as the precious metal continues to step back from recent highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer loans, rose to 4.02% from 4.00% at Friday's close. Crude oil futures were down slightly at around $61.40 after jumping last week following a move by the U.S. to place sanctions on Russian oil firms. President Donald Trump said early Monday that the U.S. is positioned to reach a trade deal with China, as the the president gets set to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea. "I have a lot of respect for President Xi, and we are going to come away with the deal,” Trump said. U.S. and Chinese negotiators over the weekend reached a framework for a trade deal that could result in a reduction of tariffs and trade barriers between the two countries. The deal will reportedly delay the implementation of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports that were slated to begin on Nov. 1, while China’s export controls on rare earth elements are also expected to be delayed as the two sides continue negotiations. Trump also expects the two countries to reach a deal on ownership of the social media app TikTok. The U.S. also announced that separate trade and mineral agreements were reached with Malaysia and Cambodia, while trade pact frameworks were struck with Thailand and Vietnam. Shares of U.S. chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which are seeking to sell into Chinese markets, were both up more than 2% in premarket trading. Trump said that the U.S. will slap an additional 10% tariff on Canadian goods after the Ontario provincial government ran an ad criticizing tariffs during the World Series on Friday. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said that broadcasts of the ad would end on Monday. Trump has criticized the ad for featuring comments from former President Ronald Reagan, which he described as a “serious misrepresentation of the facts.” Trump had placed a tariff of 35% on Canadian goods not covered by the USMCA agreement, though tariffs on some products like steel and aluminum are subject to levies of 50%. Trump had previously said trade negotiations with Canada would be “terminated” over the ad. Shares of Avidity Biosciences (RNA) are soaring in premarket trading after Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis (NVS) agreed to buy the biotechnology company in a deal valued at $12 billion. Avidity will spin off part of its early-stage precision cardiology business before closing the deal in the first half of 2026, Novartis said in a statement. “The Avidity team has built robust programs with industry-leading delivery of RNA therapeutics to muscle tissue,” Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan said. “We look forward to developing these programs to meaningfully change the trajectory of diseases for patients.” Shares of Avidity jumped more than 40% ahead of the opening bell, while Novartis shares were down about 1%. Shares of U.S.-listed Argentine companies are surging after President Javier Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party won a landslide legislative victory. President Donald Trump had offered to provide financial support for Argentina but said that the bailout hinged on the outcome of the election. "BIG WIN in Argentina for Javier Milei, a wonderful Trump Endorsed Candidate?," Trump said on Truth Social. Shares of financial services companies Grupo Financiero Galicia SA (GGAL), Banco BBVA Argentina SA (BBAR) and Banco Macro SA (BMA) each gained more than 30% in premarket trading. Shares of oil company YPF (YPF) jumped about 25%, while shares of e-commerce firm MercadoLibre (MELI) added 7%.

Title: AI is changing who gets hired – what skills will keep you employed?

Professor of Decision Sciences and Management Information Systems, Drexel University Murugan Anandarajan does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. Drexel University provides funding as a member of The Conversation US. View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AAI.s5fr5yhpt Share article Print article The consulting firm Accenture recently laid off 11,000 employees while expanding its efforts to train workers to use artificial intelligence. It’s a sharp reminder that the same technology driving efficiency is also redefining what it takes to keep a job. And Accenture isn’t alone. IBM has already replaced hundreds of roles with AI systems, while creating new jobs in sales and marketing. Amazon cut staff even as it expands teams that build and manage AI tools. Across industries, from banks to hospitals and creative companies, workers and managers alike are trying to understand which roles will disappear, which will evolve and which new ones will emerge. I research and teach at Drexel University’s LeBow College of Business, studying how technology changes work and decision-making. My students often ask how they can stay employable in the age of AI. Executives ask me how to build trust in technology that seems to move faster than people can adapt to it. In the end, both groups are really asking the same thing: Which skills matter most in an economy where machines can learn? To answer this, I analyzed data from two surveys my colleagues and I conducted over this summer. For the first, the Data Integrity & AI Readiness Survey, we asked 550 companies across the country how they use and invest in AI. For the second, the College Hiring Outlook Survey, we looked at how 470 employers viewed entry-level hiring, workforce development and AI skills in candidates. These studies show both sides of the equation: those building AI and those learning to work with it. More than half of organizations told us that AI now drives daily decision-making, yet only 38% believe their employees are fully prepared to use it. This gap is reshaping today’s job market. AI isn’t just replacing workers; it’s revealing who’s ready to work alongside it. Our data also shows a contradiction. While many companies now depend on AI internally, only 27% of recruiters say they’re comfortable with applicants using AI tools for tasks such as writing resumes or researching salary ranges. In other words, the same tools companies trust for business decisions still raise doubts when job seekers use them for career advancement. Until that view changes, even skilled workers will keep getting mixed messages about what “responsible AI use” really means. In the Data Integrity & AI Readiness Survey, this readiness gap showed up most clearly in customer-facing and operational jobs such as marketing and sales. These are the same areas where automation is advancing quickly, and layoffs tend to occur when technology evolves faster than people can adapt. At the same time, we found that many employers haven’t updated their degree or credential requirements. They’re still hiring for yesterday’s resumes while, tomorrow’s work demands fluency in AI. The problem isn’t that people are being replaced by AI; it’s that technology is evolving faster than most workers can adapt. Our research suggests that the skills most closely linked with adaptability share one theme, what I call “human-AI fluency.” This means being able to work with smart systems, question their results and keep learning as things change. Across companies, the biggest challenges lie in expanding AI, ensuring compliance with ethical and regulatory standards and connecting AI to real business goals. These hurdles aren’t about coding; they’re about good judgment. In my classes, I emphasize that the future will favor people who can turn machine output into useful human insight. I call this digital bilingualism: the ability to fluently navigate both human judgment and machine logic. What management experts call “reskilling” – or learning new skills to adapt to a new role or major changes in an old one – works best when people feel safe to learn. In our Data Integrity & AI Readiness Survey, organizations with strong governance and high trust were nearly twice as likely to report gains in performance and innovation. The data suggests that when people trust their leaders and systems, they’re more willing to experiment and learn from mistakes. In that way, trust turns technology from something to fear into something to learn from, giving employees the confidence to adapt. According to the College Hiring Outlook Survey, about 86% of employers now offer internal training or online boot camps, yet only 36% say AI-related skills are important for entry-level roles. Most training still focuses on traditional skills rather than those needed for emerging AI jobs. The most successful companies make learning part of the job itself. They build opportunities to learn into real projects and encourage employees to experiment. I often remind leaders that the goal isn’t just to train people to use AI but to help them think alongside it. This is how trust becomes the foundation for growth, and how reskilling helps retain employees. In my view, the companies leading in AI aren’t just cutting jobs; they’re redefining them. To succeed, I believe companies will need to hire people who can connect technology with good judgment, question what AI produces, explain it clearly and turn it into business value. In companies that are putting AI to work most effectively, hiring isn’t just about resumes anymore. What matters is how people apply traits like curiosity and judgment to intelligent tools. I believe these trends are leading to new hybrid roles such as AI translators, who help decision-makers understand what AI insights mean and how to act on them, and digital coaches, who teach teams to work alongside intelligent systems. Each of these roles connects human judgment with machine intelligence, showing how future jobs will blend technical skills with human insight. That blend of judgment and adaptability is the new competitive advantage. The future won’t just reward the most technical workers, but those who can turn intelligence – human or artificial – into real-world value.

October 27, 2025 08:15 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and VENU 24/7 Market News and VENU DENVER, Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and information, reports that the construction of VENU’s (NYSE American: VENU) $350 million Sunset Amphitheater in McKinney, Texas, is progressing on schedule, marking a major milestone in the company’s mission to redefine the live entertainment landscape through real estate–backed, community-integrated entertainment campuses. The state-of-the-art, 20,000-seat premium amphitheater is projected to begin its inaugural concert season in 2026, which could grow to more than 80 shows annually, in its first full year, featuring premier global talent. Strategically located at the intersection of US 75 and the Sam Rayburn Tollway, the Sunset Amphitheater sits within a 30-minute drive of nearly 4 million residents and just over an hour from almost 10 million people, one of the most lucrative and demographically dynamic catchment zones in the nation. The amphitheater’s 46-acre site is designed to function year-round with a multi-season configuration, hosting 20,000 attendees in warm months, and reconfiguring to seat 5,000 guests in the winter with heated flooring and a partially enclosed roof and wind walls to maintain comfort in colder weather. Key features include: A Model Designed for Scale Drawing on experience from its Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs, VENU continues to refine its construction process to deliver on-demand fulfillment of premium entertainment facilities with increased speed and efficiency. This approach underpins the Company’s growing portfolio, now over $5 billion in total pipeline, with $1.3 billion currently under construction across multiple states and 38 municipalities actively negotiating for future campuses. “From day one, we’ve been clear about how we intend to fund expansion — through public-private partnerships, FireSuite sales, and sale-leasebacks,” said CEO and Chairman J.W. Roth. “Our growth is accelerating faster than we expected, and the foundation we’ve laid is designed for scale.” FireSuites: The Backbone of VENU’s Expansion Central to VENU’s business model are its Luxe FireSuites, real estate–backed, triple-net-leased VIP ownership experiences offering an anticipated 11% cap rate. Each FireSuite accommodates four to ten guests, featuring VIP entry, premium parking, and in-suite hospitality. Sales momentum remains strong: $23 million in FireSuite revenue booked in just 60 days, up 250% year-over-year, with company-wide inventory nearly 49% sold across Tulsa ($80M), McKinney ($147M), and El Paso ($106M). Economic and Institutional Tailwinds According to D Magazine, the McKinney project is expected to generate $3.8 billion in local economic impact over the next decade. The project also benefits from growing institutional confidence, Vanguard Group and 23 other institutions now hold nearly 5% of VENU’s float, signaling market recognition of its scalable, asset-backed model. With strategic partnerships spanning Tixr (ticketing), AEG Presents (touring), Aramark (hospitality), Ryan LLC (PPP structuring), and Sands Investment Group (sales), VENU continues to execute on a low-debt, high-leverage growth model that generates recurring revenue before the first ticket is even sold. Looking Ahead As the live music industry is projected by Goldman Sachs to grow at a 7.2% compound annual rate through 2030, VENU’s focus on premium, flexible, and artist-friendly venues places it at the epicenter of this expansion. The McKinney Sunset Amphitheater is the blueprint for the next era of experiential entertainment.

Title: Wall Street Near Record Highs: How Can Indians Invest In US Stocks? Here's A Simple Guide

Time Published: 2025-10-27T11:57:02Z

The rapid rise of the fintech sector in India has enabled Indian investors to explore investment opportunities overseas, especially in booming markets like the United States. Global equities have become more accessible for Indian investors due to the proliferation of Portfolio Management Services (PMS), global trading platforms and fintech apps. As the US stocks have reached record highs in the last few days, it could be an opportune time for Indian investors to gain from the booming US market. Indian investors can explore a wide range of options from stocks of top global tech giants like Apple, Google and Meta to popular ETFs and index funds. The key US stock indices reached record high levels on Friday, after the potential China trade deal progress and anticipation of another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. The Dow closed above 47,000 for the first time on Friday after September’s Consumer Price Index data showed annual inflation had heated up but less than expected, as per a CNN report. Key indices, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, also rallied to new record highs on Oct. 24. The S&P 500 Index rose by 0.79% while the Dow Jones Industrials Index rallied1.01%. On the other hand, the Nasdaq 100 Index advanced 1.04%. Amid the boom in the US market, Indian investors can explore the opportunities to reap benefits through the new-age digital trading platforms that offer simple and secure ways to invest in US equities. · To start investing in US stocks, Indian investors need to follow a few simple steps: · Open a global trading account with a registered brokerage firm · Complete the KYC verification by submitting documents like identity proof, address proof, PAN and bank account details. · Some trading platforms may also ask for additional documents for compliance and legal requirements. · Once the account is set up, you can add funds and start trading in American stocks. Many international brokers are also offering overseas trading accounts for Indian investors. · Access to top global companies across industries offers an opportunity to minimise risks through diversification, while maximising returns from their growth. · Exposure to US stocks may help to minimise risks during a downturn in domestic markets. · Many brokers are allowing the opening of free trading accounts for Indian investors. · Investments in American stocks can be made starting at as little as $10. · For long-term investors, investments at regular intervals also minimise risks due to the advantage of dollar-cost averaging. Before investing in US stocks, it’s important for Indian investors to know about regulatory restrictions, compliance norms and transaction-related guidelines. Currency exchange rates and capital gains taxes could also reduce your actual returns from the US stocks. Tax compliance in both countries could be a tedious task for many investors. Market volatilities arising from global economic factors and geopolitical issues could also pose a serious risk for investors. It’s also advisable to consistently monitor currency exchange rates as they can impact the overall value of your portfolio in rupee terms. To conclude, Indian investors can easily access American stocks with today’s tech-driven trading platforms. It’s advisable to take a balanced approach and remain watchful of all key factors while ensuring compliance as per Indian laws and RBI rules for seamless investing.

Title: Saudi Power Broker Pitches Kingdoms AI Pivot to Wall Street
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/saudi-power-broker-pitches-kingdoms-ai-pivot-to-wall-street-11761561179513.html
Time Published: 2025-10-27T10:32:59Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia’s annual investment showpiece kicks off this week against a steady drumbeat of headlines on the kingdom’s strained finances: The deficit has grown as oil prices persist below levels needed to balance the budget, forcing spending to be reprioritized and parts of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s trillion-dollar ambitions to be scaled back. At the center of it all will be Richard Attias, who has spent the past decade courting investors to back the kingdom’s economic transformation. The Moroccan-born power broker is ensconced at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s global outreach, often pictured with Prince Mohammed, Yasir Al Rumayyan, who runs the $1 trillion Public Investment Fund, and even US President Donald Trump. “The show must go on,” he said on the sidelines of last year’s Future Investment Initiative that opened under the shadow of war. Tensions shrouding the region may have ebbed, but this year’s event presents challenges of its own — mainly the kingdom’s pivot from being an exporter of capital to a seeker of foreign cash. In an interview in Riyadh, Attias credited the FII with playing a crucial role in driving investment, generating as much as $190 billion in deals since its 2017 launch. He characterized the kingdom’s growing emphasis on domestic investment as “extremely fair” and said financiers’ interest in the country remains strong. “We didn’t create FII for people to come, take the money and run,” Attias said. “We created FII for people to understand where the money should go.” Wall Street is paying close attention. This year’s forum will lean more heavily into technology and artificial intelligence, two industries central to the crown prince’s diversification plan. It will feature marquee names, including Blackstone Inc. Chief Executive Officer Steve Schwarzman and BlackRock Inc.’s Larry Fink, who are both vying to invest billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia’s new AI firm, Humain. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO David Solomon and others will be eying opportunities in the kingdom’s emerging private credit market. The Davos Rival About a decade ago, officials in Riyadh wanted an event to rival Davos as part of efforts to lure foreign investors into an economy long fueled by oil. They turned to Attias, a former World Economic Forum insider, who helped the kingdom set up FII. At its inaugural 2017 edition, MBS — newly elevated as crown prince — laid out his vision for Neom, a planned $500 billion city on the Red Sea that signaled the kingdom’s outsize ambitions. Eight years later, Neom’s costs have ballooned to an estimated $1.5 trillion, and progress has slowed. The ninth edition of the FII comes amid growing scrutiny of those projects and renewed doubts over whether Saudi Arabia can sustain its breakneck development agenda. Even the local stock market — once a regional bright spot — has struggled, with recent listings underwhelming. For Attias, whose eponymous firm counts the kingdom and FII as key clients, the stakes are uniquely personal. Richard Attias & Associates produces dozens of events worldwide in addition to the Saudi confab, and is now preparing for a listing that could earn its founder millions. But those fortunes are tied to the success of the Saudi story Attias helped craft. Get the Mideast Money newsletter , a weekly look at the intersection of wealth and power in the region. The event typically attracts thousands of people each year. Since 2023, attendance requires a $15,000 annual membership with the FII Institute, a nonprofit that manages the Riyadh-based conference and the wider brand. Attias describes the fee as “modest” compared with global peers such as Davos or the Milken Institute Global Conference, where tickets start at around $25,000. Although often dubbed “Davos in the Desert,” Attias rejects the comparison. “Number one, we’re not in Davos, and number two, we’re not in the desert,” he said. “Riyadh today is one of the most developed cities in the world.” In any case, FII has now become an integral part of the kingdom’s broader investment strategy and is expanding its global reach. Attias is helping set up a satellite edition of the conference in Tokyo, on the back of a turn in Miami that marked one of Trump’s first public appearances after being sworn in for a second term. Saudi Arabia’s success snagging Trump to headline the gathering spotlighted the close relationship between the two sides and their growing financial ties. The crown prince is set to meet Trump in the White House in November, in his first visit to the US since 2018. This year’s line-up features dignitaries from about 20 countries ranging from China’s vice president to the UK’s chancellor of the exchequer, showing how the kingdom balances competing global interests. Gulf governments are “quite adept at working both ends of the political economy spectrum to advance their interests on the global stage,” said Robert Mogielnicki, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. The event also places Attias at the highest echelons of power in Saudi Arabia. He says he communicates with world leaders via WhatsApp, and that Crown Prince Mohammed “trusts totally what FII is doing.” For all its successes, the FII has faced its share of crises. The 2018 murder of columnist Jamal Khashoggi caused top business leaders, including Bill Gates, Jamie Dimon and Richard Branson to distance themselves from the event, citing human rights concerns. Attias said that year’s edition still drew more delegates than before, buoyed by participants from Russia, China, the Middle East and Africa. By 2019, most who had shunned the event had returned, lured by the promise of mega-deals tied to the Vision 2030 economic transformation agenda. Many, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., have since deepened ties to the kingdom. The bank underwrote a $20 billion debt facility to help investors including the PIF take Electronic Arts Inc. private in a $55 billion deal last month, and secured a regional headquarters license in Saudi Arabia days before FII. Chief Executive Dimon is scheduled to speak at this year’s event. Global Player Financier Ken Moelis was among dealmakers who stuck it out in 2018. His firm landed major mandates, including Aramco’s record $29 billion IPO, earning him the nickname “Ken of Arabia.” Moelis & Co. is now advising Attias’s firm on its planned listing, expected to involve about 30% of the company’s shares. Both Attias and Sanabil, an investment arm of the PIF, are considering selling part of their stakes. Attias said he expects Sanabil to “make good money” from the offering but insists the goal is to institutionalize the business rather than cash out. He also hinted at the possibility of a future secondary listing. “We have offices in Dubai, Riyadh, New York, Paris and Africa,” he said. “So we’re a global player.” RA&A has evolved beyond producing the FII, which now accounts for only about 10% of its revenue, and organizes more than 50 conferences a year. Ahmad Al-Husseini serves as CEO, though Attias’s personal imprint remains. His wife Cecilia — previously married to former French president Nicolas Sarkozy — and daughter both work at the firm. At the FII Institute, Attias took over as acting CEO after Penny Richards, formerly of the Aspen Institute, resigned just months into the job. A permanent successor is expected by year-end. “It’s not easy to follow the traces of someone who has a very strong fingerprint,” Attias said, acknowledging that his deep involvement makes succession harder. The intensifying competition for events across the Gulf presents another challenge. Dubai plans to launch Future Finance Week with the Institute of International Finance in May 2026. The regional circuit already includes Abu Dhabi Finance Week in December and Doha’s Qatar Economic Forum, a pre-summer fixture. While these events will mean more opportunities for firms that help organize them, it will also mean more competition for existing conferences, including FII. Attias, though, remains confident FII has carved out its own space. “I am told by many people, ‘Richard, give me the dates of FII for the next three to four years,’” he said. The government of the State of Qatar is the underwriter of the Qatar Economic Forum, Powered by Bloomberg. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Xbox’s President of Game Content and Studios, Matt Booty, sat down in an interview with The New York Times and explained Microsoft’s expanding multiplatform push, which came out just as it was announced that Halo Studio’s remake of Halo: Combat Evolved, now known as Halo: Campaign Evolved, is coming to PlayStation 5. In the interview, he commented on the cross-platform shift, stating that consumers no longer have an attachment to the devices or platforms on which they play games, unlike previous generations, when players typically sided with Xbox, PlayStation, or PC. He said, “We are all seeking to meet people where they are. Our biggest competition isn’t another console… We are competing more and more with everything from TikTok to movies.” When asked about the widespread layoffs, crossing the 9000 mark, Booty answered with a brief response, “Layoffs are difficult. They are part of managing our business.” Xbox’s multiplatform shift continues, with former exclusives like Grounded and Sea of Thieves already available on PlayStation. Similarly, other Xbox exclusives, such as Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl, Forza Horizon 5, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, have finally launched on PlayStation 5 after their Xbox and PC releases. Up next on the catalog of Xbox games coming to PS5 is Microsoft Flight Simulator 2025, which launches on December 8, 2025, and the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved, the Unreal Engine remake of the original 2001 cult-classic Halo title. The Halo series has driven sales across four generations of Xbox consoles, reportedly generating over $10 billion in revenue and shipping over 81 million units globally, with Halo 3 selling the most units in the series, at almost 14.5 million copies on the Xbox 360. However, it’s speculated that Xbox is aggressively pursuing this multi-platform push to increase its revenue goals. Earlier, a Bloomberg report revealed that Microsoft pushed its Xbox division for “30% accountability margins”, higher than the industry average between 17% and 22%. These well-above-industry-norm revenue targets subsequently led to the layoff of thousands of employees over the years, the cancellation of numerous high-profile projects across multiple studios, and price hikes for its Xbox Game Pass subscription service.

Title: The worst bull run ever? How institutions, memes, and macro turned crypto’s glory cycle into a grind

One frustrated altcoin trader says the quiet part out loud: this isn’t the euphoric bull cycle crypto hoped for; it’s a stripped-down reality check. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. For a market supposedly in a bull run, it doesn’t feel like one. Sure, Bitcoin may have set a couple of record highs this cycle, but the rallies have been uneventfully yawn-inducing, and the corrections have been savage. Altcoins are down 90% or more. Retail has vanished. And even the diehards are wondering if this so-called bull cycle deserves the name at all. This is, by many accounts, the hardest bull market crypto has ever seen. Bitcoin has doubled since its 2023 lows, but the soul of the market feels hollowed out. What happened? Altcoin trader “Crypto Birb” breaks it down into three main reasons. Wall Street didn’t just arrive this cycle; it moved in and redecorated. BlackRock, Fidelity, and Goldman didn’t come to speculate; they came to own infrastructure, custody networks, and tokenized real-world assets. Institutional adoption is the tidy headline, but what it really means is extraction at scale. They’re not playing memecoins or hunting airdrops. They bought the pipes, liquidity rails, and compliance corridors that everyone else has to rent. As Telcoin Magazine and Fortune both note, institutional adoption in early 2025 was “foundational, not speculative.” That’s great for Bitcoin, terrible for the culture. As Crypto Birb comments: “Smart money took what’s valuable – good on them.” If the institutions professionalized the space, memecoins disfigured it. What began as satire became the dominant narrative of 2024 and 2025. Every week brought a new “community” token, a new animal, a new political in-joke, and a new wave of burned holders. Memecoins turned crypto into a casino with no exit doors. Token after token pumped on virality alone, then cratered. Even industry veterans who should’ve known better got caught chasing hype over substance. It was the perfect storm of self-sabotage: retail greed met web3 irony, and both got wrecked. Even the macro backdrop worked against risk. President Trump’s trade wars and tariffs, praised by some for protectionism, triggered a 20% drawdown in equities and sapped liquidity. Combined with persistently high interest rates, capital became expensive, speculative flows dried up, and risk assets like crypto flatlined.​ Ironically, the “pro‑crypto administration” ended up freezing the retail comeback. With rates high, consumer spending slowed, and the average investor’s appetite for 100x tokens evaporated. What should’ve been the era of abundance turned into a patience test. And yet, amid all the wreckage, Bitcoin persists, slow, steady, and sovereign. Institutional capital has cemented its legitimacy while everything else burns. As a16z’s State of Crypto report shows, Bitcoin’s strength is underwritten by macro forces and regulatory acceptance.​ This is what maturity looks like: less euphoria, fewer parabolic charts, and a market that’s finally behaving like a financial system rather than a playground. But for those who came here for “number go up,” it feels like a punishment. This bull cycle isn’t exciting; it’s exhausting. Bitcoin’s resilience proves crypto can endure. But the rest of the market, its creativity, its retail energy, and its wild optimism were collateral damage. Maybe that’s the price of progress. Or maybe it’s a sign that somewhere along the way, we lost the script, chasing the meme at the expense of the mission. As Crypto Birb states: “We got played. BY OURSELVES. This is our punishment for choosing hype over utility.” Either way, this bull run will go down in history not for its gains, but for its lesson: not all cycles are meant to make you rich.

Title: Exit dialogue: What would you consider a decent severance pay?

She rolled her eyes. Pay discussions are sensitive, but easier when you do it before joining, hence I ignored her non-friendly body language and pursued, “I mean, if you terminate me in the first year, will there be a special severance pay?” That conversation went on for another 45 minutes without leading to any conclusion, and she then had to pass it on to her CEO for a resolution. Are you wondering why I was spoiling my chances of being employed as a CEO? I had my reasons — the risk factors were big. The enterprise in question had the dubious distinction of asking two people before me to leave in the first year of appointment; and, if anointed, I would have been their fifth leader in seven years. I had asked for a year’s compensation if my employment contract were to be ended by the organisation in the first year. They didn’t have a formal retrenchment policy and were hence hesitant. Well, that was more than 15 years ago; today, most progressive organisations have a formal retrenchment policy, and the formulas are fixed. According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), several countries offer some sort of a redundancy pay. The ILO’s Employment Protection Legislation (EPLex) database covers 116 countries, and lists the severance pay in months, based on tenure. Guess where India features in this? You will be surprised to note that India, along with countries like Japan, is at the top of the list, recommending 20 months of severance pay for employees serving 20 years. However, countries like the US, which dish out attractive severances to their ousted CEOs, recommend nothing, as per the ILO database. In a way, for every year of service, one month of severance pay is considered acceptable. According to the website TrueUp, which tracks tech layoffs, May and July saw the most number of layoffs — 24,000 and 46,000, respectively. It says the layoffs at tech companies have impacted 158,993 people so far in 2025. That’s about 541 people per day. Sounds like a lot? But then, if you compare with 2024, it was about 653 per day. All of us criticise enterprises that lay off people. But does it affect their brand worth? We know Wall Street rewards headcount reduction and even CEO firings. Remember, the stock price of Starbucks went up by 20 per cent when it replaced the last CEO. Let’s name the 10 brands that laid off employees in 2025 and ask ourselves whether we would be willing to recommend our near and dear ones to work there in the future? According to the platform Intellizence, leading companies that announced layoffs in 2025 include UPS (20,000), Dell (12,000), Nissan (12,000), Intel (10,000), HBC (8,300), Chevron (8,000), DHL (8,000), BP (7,700) and Audi (7,500). As per company filings cited by Bloomberg, Reliance Retail laid off 38,000 employees in 2024. Will anyone refuse to join these enterprises if they are recruiting again? We know severance pay is a question of intent and affordability for an enterprise. When Meta laid off 11,000 employees in 2022, the company paid $975 million in severance, about $88,000 per person on average. In a subsequent regulatory filing, the Facebook parent said “the impact of these costs was not material” as it was offset by what it saved in payroll and other employee benefits. A Bloomberg review of Russell 3000 companies that made layoffs between 2022 and 2024 showed that, on average, each laid-off worker received a severance pay of $40,000. The report also highlighted an extreme example of a healthcare company with an average payout of almost $212,000 per laid-off worker. Back home, when TCS recently announced its severance package for the 12,000-odd employees it intends to lay off, most of us termed the offer as generous. According to reports, affected employees will be offered a minimum of six months’ pay while those who have served 20 years will be given two years’ pay. Would you prefer a six-month or two-year salary paid upfront, rather than continuing with your job? It may depend on your personal and professional context. What if you don’t get your next job within the next six months? After 20 years in a single company that laid you off for want of better skills, what are the chances of getting a suitable job in two years? One can call the severance pay attractive if the laid-off person is able to secure a job before the money runs out. A severance paycheque is a ticking time bomb till you get your next job offer. Picture this: one gets a job well in time, and there is a handsome additional amount in the bank after getting laid off, thanks to the severance pay. Will you trade the money in the bank for feeling unwanted by your former employer? Are the uncertainties you had to go through, the anxieties, and the feeling of rejection caused during the redundancy period worth the money you received in the end? Let’s face it — in today’s world, the scars of layoffs are inevitable. Let’s believe that the scars show us where we have been and don’t dictate where we are going!

October 26, 2025 19:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Oct. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “Welcome to the 26th issue of our Weekly Report. First, let’s go over the key progress made in the EAI Flywheel. On S1 User Ecosystem: Faraday Finance Inc. was officially established and has submitted its auto finance license application to the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI). The company aims to promote new vehicle sales by soon offering customized finance solutions for FF and FX users — including vehicle financing and leasing services. Through flexible and customer-centric payment options, Faraday Finance could enhance vehicle affordability, improve purchase conversion, and drive substantial sales growth. This is an important step for potentially boosting sales and delivery of models including the FX Super One. In the U.S., most customers either buy cars with a loan or choose to lease them. The progress of our finance company would give our future users more choices and help FF and FX attract new buyers faster. The company could also help manage financial assets and cash flow more efficiently.It will lay the foundation for a fully integrated and dedicated finance ecosystem that supports users through their entire ownership journey. Last weekend, we participated in ComplexCon, one of the world’s most influential pop-culture events, held at the Las Vegas Convention Center. The event brought together hundreds of top streetwear and pop-culture brands and over 50,000 attendees. Both the FF 91 2.0 and FX Super One became spotlight products at the show, attracting significant attention from visitors. On S2-S4 Product & Technology, Supply Chain, Production, and Delivery: As mentioned earlier, the first batch of full-set parts procurement agreement for FX Super One has been signed. This week, key team leaders traveled to the Hanford factory to review preparations for the first vehicle off-line milestone. The whole team is now in full sprint mode for the year-end off-line target for our first FX Super One vehicle. This marks a key milestone for FX, from R&D and design to prototype development, pilot validation, and eventually the potential for mass production, subject to securing necessary agreements, funding and permitting. The entire company — especially the factory team — is now fully mobilized and making thorough preparations to achieve this milestone, which holds great significance not only for the FX brand, but also for the entire company. Moving on to S5 Capital Markets and Finance: The biggest highlight this week is that BlackRock—one of the world’s largest asset managers—increased its holdings in FFAI once again. According to its latest 13G filing with the SEC, as of September 30, 2025, BlackRock owned about 6.8 million FFAI common shares, up from 5.38 million shares at the end of last quarter—an increase of roughly 1.41 million shares, or 26%. Let’s take a look at S6, Middle East progress: We’re now just two days away from the FX Super One Grand Launch in Dubai, which will take place on October 28 at the Armani Hotel, Burj Khalifa. We invite everyone to join the live stream and witness this milestone together. I’m also thrilled to share that we have officially signed one of the greatest sports legends of all time — a true GOAT — who will become the first global owner and Co-Creation Officer of the FX Super One. This exciting partnership will be officially unveiled at the Middle East Final Launch this coming week. On Crypto Flywheel: The Crypto Flywheel also saw solid progress this week. QLGN announced a strategic partnership with BitGo and kicked off its first batch of C10 Treasury allocations. The next day, daily trading volume surged to nearly $300 million. Looking ahead to next week’s plan: After the FX Super One Middle East Final Launch, we’ll share more updates on our Middle East operations, first vehicle off-line progress, and details of our partnership with our first global GOAT owner.We’re now entering one of the most important growth phases in our company’s history—and we’re confident in delivering on our commitments to our stockholders, investors, partners, and users. See you next week.” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

Title: St Finbarr's pip Nemo in Cork nailbiter

Full Content:
RTÉ Sport contributor St Finbarr's 1-14 Nemo Rangers 1-13 St Finbarr’s are the Cork Premier Senior Football Champions for 2025 following a nail biting 1-14 to 1-13 victory over their great rivals Nemo Rangers at SuperValu Páirc Uí Chaoimh. Steven Sherlock kicked 0-05 and dual star Brian Hayes was named Player of the Match after tallying 1-02 as the Andy Scannell Cup was draped in blue and yellow ribbons for the first time since 2021. This is the club’s 11th victory overall in the competition and perhaps the sweetest of the lot as it is the first time that St Finbarr’s have beaten Nemo Rangers in the decider, with this being the fifth meeting in the final between the two clubs. The result also marks just the second time in 36 years that the blue and yellow has triumphed over the green and black at senior level. Nemo Rangers had their own demons, as Robbie Dwyer’s side were out to avoid losing three consecutive county finals following successive defeats to Castlehaven. The Barr’s edged it in the second half, despite trailing 1-09 to 0-10 at the break with Kevin O’Donovan’s goal in the 21st minute ultimately the difference after a period of play that saw the two clubs level four times. Things exploded after the restart as Sherlock converted a free and Brian Hayes rifled the roof of the net in the 32nd minute to make the scoreboard read 1-12 to 1-09. Two quick goal chances then fell to both clubs, and good goalkeeping by Darragh Newman and Micheál Aodh Martin increased the tension around the ground as the clocked ticked on. Sherlock followed that up with a point from play, and Mark Cronin immediately replied for Nemo Rangers at the Blackrock End. The corner forward had and opportunity to reduce the arrears down to one with his next touch, but the free for a two pointer hit the post in the 47th minute. Cronin did not miss with his next placed ball, this time from inside the arc, and it was 1-13 to 1-11 with just under five minutes left to play. Both clubs went to their bench in search of something, as the nervous feeling inside the ground seemed to reach new levels. Paul Kerrigan was one of those brought on by Nemo, with the 2010 All Ireland winner entering the pitch seeking his 11th county title. Conor Horgan was the one to equalise with an orange flag, just as the clock turned red, and a grandstand finish was set up. A substitute did decide the destination of the Andy Scannell Cup, and it was Cillian Myers Murray who curled the ball over in the second minute of time added on. Nemo poured forward in search of an equalising or match winning score, but they could not get through the blue wall.

Title: Germany is doing to itself what even its defeat in WWII couldn’t
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/626988-germany-deindustrialization-ww2-defeat/
Time Published: 2025-10-26T17:32:37Z
Full Content:
By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory Toward the end of World War II in Europe, the US government pondered a plan to not only demilitarize but also disintegrate and deindustrialize postwar Germany. Named after its main proponent, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, the Morgenthau Plan proceeded from the insane assumption that “it is a fallacy that Europe needs a strong industrial Germany.” If it had been implemented, the remains of defeated Germany would have been deliberately turned into a post-industrial wasteland. But then the Cold War happened, everyone, East and West, wanted their Germans making modern things in factories again, and so it was Marshall Plan in and Morgenthau Plan out. Lucky Germans. Now the US-Soviet Cold War has been over for a third of a century already. You’d think that for the Germans – finally free of the odd obligation to kill each other on behalf of Washington and Moscow in case of World War Three and (sort of) happily re-united – Morgenthau’s dark fantasies would just be a tale of bad times long gone-by. But there you would underestimate the often badly overlooked German gift for eccentricity. In reality, post-Cold War Germany’s governments have set out on a resolute course of self-Morgenthauing economic auto-asphyxiation, adapting and obstinately clinging to policies that look as if they had been deliberately devised to deindustrialize and wreck their own country. How can this be? For starters consider the case of global chemistry giant BASF: “What’s happening to Germany you’ll see first at BASF,” some say. And they have a point. Until recently, the German-headquartered company was considered the “crown jewel” of the country’s industry. Now, Germany is “mired in its longest period of stagnation since the Second World War” – says not Moscow’s RT but London’s FT – and BASF exemplifies much of what went so very, very badly wrong. Like much of German business in general, the country’s traditionally powerful and vital chemical industry “is stuck in the greatest crisis” since, at least, the early 1990s. Since 2019, German industry as a whole has shed a total of almost a quarter-million jobs. Regarding BASF – originally founded in 1865 smack in the middle of modern Germany’s Time of Founders (“Gründerzeit”) as the “Badische Anilin- und Sodafabrik” – it is true that it is still the largest chemical industry company in the world with subsidiaries in over 80 countries and 112,000 employees. But in Germany, at its original production site in the city of Ludwigshafen – for now still the largest such facility worldwide – it has been enduring billions in losses for years. As a whole, BASF’s business at home, in Germany, is contributing nothing to the company’s profits, at best. If BASF is still doing alright, then not because but in spite of its historic German base. As its former CEO Martin Brudermuller (now with Mercedes Benz, in the other key German industry) put it in 2024, BASF was “making profits everywhere in the world, except Germany.” And that – together with China’s rise (now constituting half of the global chemical industry market) – is why BASF is reducing operations not only in Ludwigshafen but all of Germany, while building a giant new production site in Zhanjiang in China. An up-to-date “mirror image” of the company’s trademark full-integration or composite production concept (“Verbund”) originally pioneered in Ludwigshafen, BASF Zhanjiang is the greatest single investment in the company’s history. In short, Germany’s chemical giant is cloning and optimizing its historic core – not elsewhere in Germany, not in Europe, and not in the US either, but in China. While Brudermüller, an outspoken man, has been warning of Germany’s comprehensive deindustrialization. And though no one will admit it, it is easy to guess what will happen to the dated, ever less competitive original in Ludwigshafen. The open secret of success of BASF’s Ludwigshafen flagship was two-fold: German science and engineering, management, and work ethic played a key role, but so did inexpensive gas from Russia, used as energy source and raw material. Both the German and the Russian inputs were indispensable. Ludwigshafen’s success, as much of the German economy, was a direct result of successful German-Russian, mutually beneficial cooperation. No longer. The EU and Berlin’s – both, ironically, run by Germans – self-destructive policy of re-defining mutual benefits as oh-so-horrible “dependence” to be replaced with some real dependence on the incredibly reliable US and cutting themselves off from Russian natural gas is the decisive factor in Ludwigshafen’s ongoing decline. There are other problems as well, but without this suicidal strategy, longstanding issues – such as, for instance bureaucracy, a mishandled “green transition,” and US tariff warfare – could be resolved or, at least, managed. Yet without inexpensive energy and raw materials, the decline is irreversible. Indeed, by now, BASF is warning of scenarios in which Ludwigshafen will soon stop its gradual descent, but not with recovery. Instead a total crash may loom. The cause? A massive potential gas shortage. None of the above is exceptional in today’s Germany. Of course, economic sectors and individual companies have their specific features. But what matters is how much BASF’s fate represents that of Germany’s economy as a whole. Except the latter is usually worse, often much worse, as in lethal. Consider a few data points: Germany is experiencing a twenty-year peak of insolvencies, as the co-leader of the AfD (Alternative for Germany) party has recently pointed out. And it’s not just Germany’s opposition (and single biggest party in the polls). Even the thoroughly government-aligned de facto state-TV channel ZDF has to admit that “Made in Germany is crumbling.” From 2024 to 2025 alone, 2.1% of Germany’s industrial jobs have gone missing. If you are one of the many Germans busy developing and assembling cars, your chances of employment survival have been even worse: in that sector, a whopping 51,000 or 7% of jobs were axed in just one year – and there’s no end in sight. Profits have been cratering: by over 50% between January and June at Mercedes-Benz, by over a third in the second quarter of 2025 at VW. And that was before some very stable geniuses in Washington made the Dutch government steal – that’s the correct term – Chinese-owned chip maker Nexperia. Inevitably, China is retaliating. Unlike Germany, it’s not run by strange people who take things such as, say, a terrorist attack by “allies” on vital infrastructure with an obsequious grin and a bow. Nexperia is duly out of action and German car companies are among the worst hit by the resulting supply shortages: Hildegard Müller, the head of their national association, has warned of “significant production restrictions, depending on circumstances even full interruptions.” Slow claps for you again, great master trade war strategists of the West. If BASF’s Ludwigshafen is ground zero for the (still) relatively slow decline of the German chemical industry, Stuttgart is shaping up to be one of the cities most devastated by the more rapid fall of the car makers. With 17%, or a quarter of a million, of Stuttgart’s population earning their living from cars – whether at Mercedes-Benz or Porsche directly or one of the many local suppliers, such as much less well-known Mahle or Eberspächer – the city has reason to be afraid. Some are already talking about a bleak future as Germany’s Detroit, the epitome of US rustbelt deindustrialization and dilapidation. The news is certainly not reassuring: Car parts supplier Mahle has already shed 7,000 jobs, for instance. Multinational engineering and technology company Bosch, originally from Stuttgart and now headquartered just a few kilometers to its West, has put 22,000 on the chopping block in Germany as a whole, including almost 2,000 in Stuttgart. Zoom out again, and the picture remains dismal: The reputable Ifo Institute predicts microscopic growth of 0.2% for this year. Next year, they guess, things may look up a little, with 1.3% growth. But even if that actually happens – downward revisions have happened only recently – it is going to be due to the government’s reckless militarist-Keynesian debt-and-spending splurge. Berlin’s current “elite” may be masochists, delighting in taking rough treatment and insults from the US, Ukraine, and even Poland. But Germans as a whole are, of course, less bizarre. By now two thirds are dissatisfied with the coalition in power. If their national misery has a face it is that of its leader, chancellor Friedrich Merz, an ex-BlackRock cadre who charmingly combines tone-deaf, offensive pep talks implying the nation consists of lazy lay-abouts with rants about Russia, drones, and, of course, the AfD, now also accused of being in cahoots with – drumroll – Moscow. Merz, it must be said in Germany’s honor, is unpopularity personified. Think of a German version of Keir “I work for Israel, not you” Starmer in the UK or Emmanuel “please go, please just go!” Macron in France. And that is a sign of national health. In a country whose rulers are systematically running its economy into the ground via an obviously demented policy of self-crippling, popular discontent stands for hope. Perhaps, at long last, enough Germans will soon have had enough.

Title: If you don't love the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses, you won't like smart glasses, period

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Ray-Ban (Gen 2) glasses don't make major changes, but they didn't need to: It's still the best way to capture candid shots of your day or analyze your environment with your phone in your pocket, only with enough battery life so that you no longer have to worry they'll die mid-outing. Meta eventually wants true "all-day" glasses that record and respond to everything you see; these Gen 2 glasses aren't there yet, but they're getting closer. Major battery life upgrade Variety of styles, colors, and lenses for everyone High-res photos and stabilized action videos Contextual Meta AI insights Promise of regular post-launch updates Still too thick and heavy for non-techies Not as water-resistant as Vanguards No HUD Why you can trust Android Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. When I reviewed the original Ray-Ban Meta glasses, I explained how much I liked them, but that others might skip them because of the Meta connection and privacy concerns. Instead, they became the world's best-selling smart glasses. Ray-Ban/Oakley maker EssilorLuxottica is thriving thanks to AI glasses sales, on target to make 10 million units next year to meet demand. My Gen 2 review will focus on two types of people: the millions of Gen 1 buyers wondering whether these new glasses are enough to justify an upgrade, and smart glasses skeptics wondering whether to hop on the Ray-Ban train. For the first group, the Gen 2-to-Gen 1 gap is subtle, with some problems addressed and others unresolved. But just as Meta transformed the Gen 1s with Meta AI and Live AI months after launch, the best is yet to come for the Gen 2s — if you're patient. For smart glasses skeptics, I'll help you decide whether these Ray-Bans can replace your current combination of normal (sun)glasses, earbuds, and smartphone cameras. It'll come down to your personal style as much as hardware, but you probably won't like any current smart glasses if these are too thick or heavy for you. Style Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer (Gen 2) Ray-Ban Meta Skyler (Gen 2) Ray-Ban Meta Headliner (Gen 2) Frame colors Shiny Cosmic Blue, Matte Black, Shiny Black Shiny Mystic Violet, Shiny Chalky Gray, Shiny Black Shiny Asteroid Grey, Matte Black, Shiny Black Lens colors Clear, Gradient Graphite, Green, Polarized (Green G-15, Dark Brown, Grey); Transitions (Amber*, Amethyst, Brown*, Emerald*, Green G-15, Grey, Ruby*, Sapphire) Clear, Gradient Graphite, Green, Polarized (Green G-15, Dark Brown, Grey); Transitions (Amber*, Amethyst, Brown*, Emerald*, Green G-15, Grey, Ruby*, Sapphire) Clear, Gradient Graphite, Green, Polarized (Green G-15, Dark Brown, Grey); Transitions (Amber*, Amethyst, Brown*, Emerald*, Green G-15*, Grey, Ruby*, Sapphire) The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses ship in three styles, each with multiple colors and lens options. Wayfarers have Standard or Large frame sizes to accommodate larger heads; Headliners have High and Low bridges. Skyler frames are one-size-fits-all. All styles and lens types let you add a prescription, though only through Meta or Ray-Ban directly. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler all start at $379 — $80 higher than the Gen 1 glasses. You'll pay $30 or $80 for Polarized or Transitions lenses, respectively. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Buying from Ray-Ban directly unlocks unique Transitions lens colors like Amethyst, Ruby, or Sapphire, Polarized colors like Dark Brown, extra-thin lenses for stronger prescriptions, and an "optimized" anti-reflective layer to combat smudges and oils.

Most of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) perks will be old news to Gen 1 owners, but are still worth explaining to new buyers. When I go out for a solo walk, run, hike, or round of golf, I think about wearing my Ray-Bans. They give me rich speakers for music or audiobooks to keep me motivated as I work out. I can snap first-person-perspective photos with a quick tap of the right temple button, and the five-mic array helps my voice come through crystal clear during phone calls. At any time, I can say, "Hey Meta," and have the AI explain what plant species I'm looking at, set a reminder for where I parked, check my next appointment in Google Calendar, start playing a specific song or playlist, or message a family member. None of this is all that different from what you can do with a smartphone and earbuds, and they won't function without a phone. But it's a convenient combo package. The design isn't perfect, but the EssilorLuxottica partnership couldn't have worked out any better for Meta. The Ray-Ban manufacturer tapped its design expertise to make these glasses look normal (if thick) with dozens of variations; other tech brands can't offer this variety or leverage in-person glasses stores for fittings. The Wayfarers are the default look, boxy and a bit generic to "blend in" the most, while the rounded-edge Headliners and Skylers soften the thick-framed look somewhat. Whichever style you choose, I recommend splurging on the Transitions lenses. I don't use them indoors that often, but if I'm out for a long activity, they give me good eye protection to start and then switch to clear once the sun goes down. As I wrote in my Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 first impressions, longer battery life is their most important upgrade. The old version had a 4-hour max but rarely lasted that long, and doubling the max capacity without the glasses getting noticeably heavier is worth praising. I've never hit Meta's eight-hour estimate, but only because I tend to use the Gen 2s heavily: nonstop music streaming, plenty of 3K videos, and Meta AI commands. Meta's five-hour estimate with music aligns with my experience, about 20% per hour while using all the main features. Whenever I've gone out and only taken photos or asked Meta a few questions, it's much closer to the 12.5%/hour that Meta promises, with little battery use while idling. But with frequent videos or livestreaming, you'll burn through battery quickly. - Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Gen 1 - Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Oakley Meta HSTN - Oakley Meta Vanguard vs. Oakley Meta HSTN Camera quality from the 12MP ultrawide sensor hasn't changed since the Gen 1 glasses, and my thoughts from 2023 apply to the Gen 2s. Meta's camera is excellent at catching moving targets or adjusting to your movement; I've taken great shots while running. It captures a ton of detail, but no wayfinder means you'll have trouble knowing what you're actually photographing or how close to stand. Your height will also affect things; as a tall guy, I need to squat for the best close-up angle. Meta wants you to upload these directly to Instagram, but I find they usually need cropping and magic erasing in Google Photos first. Meta's post-processing tends to oversaturate photos, and Magic Eraser removes the unnecessary details. Be prepared to accept some trade-offs. Night photography is blurry, even with artificial light sources, and you won't find any alternative "modes" like portrait that blur things behind your subject. For natural, on-the-go, quick-snap photography, they're excellent; I can capture things I'd usually miss if I had to pull out my phone first. I just hope that by the Gen 3 release in a few years, we'll get landscape photography, a shortcut button to zoom in for faraway subjects, and other improvements. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) and Oakley Meta HSTN glasses have the same video settings: 1080p or 3K at 30 FPS. Meta also says it'll eventually support 1200p at 60 FPS, but that setting still hasn't arrived as of late October. You can see the Oakley video test above from Android Central's Nick Sutrich showing how the new 3K video setting compares to 1080p on the Gen 1s. My findings are similar to his: 3K HDR videos give you more detail, better contrast, and less compression than the 1080p setting, especially in well-lit areas; in dimly lit rooms or at night, Ray-Ban videos are blurry and dull on either setting. For mobile videos — like recording while running a half-marathon — the 1080p setting is better, while 3K is distractingly shaky. Meta gave its sporty Vanguard glasses a smoother 60 FPS mode and customizable stabilization tools, so I'm assuming the Ray-Bans will get those soon. My mom loved testing out my Ray-Ban Meta glasses; she went around her garden asking about every type of plant and taking photos. But after the novelty wore off, she handed them back and said she'd never wear them long-term because they're too big, both physically and aesthetically. I think plenty of people will agree with her that the thickness needed to fit the cameras, mics, and battery is very distinct, and might not fit their vibe. Meta will eventually have to pull off glasses that weigh slightly less if people are going to wear them all day, not just for outings. I recommend trying them on at a local glasses or electronics store if you're uncertain. You'll have to decide if their 50g weight is oppressive and which size to choose. I find the Standard fit is more secure but digs deeper into my nose, while the Large fit is more comfortable but tends to drift down my face when I walk or run. Smart glasses have become much more mainstream, and the Gen 2 design blends in more than most XR glasses. But people outside the tech sphere still dislike wearable cameras that can start recording without warning, even with the white LED to warn them. Some first-gen nitpicks have returned this generation, like the Ray-Ban logo being distractingly visible in the right lens, or Meta AI not being able to change glasses settings, only telling you where to look. You'll have to accept the noticeable audio spill; at the volume necessary to hear your music clearly, anyone else nearby will hear it, too. And I'd like Meta to add different audio profiles tailored to specific types of music (aka a bass mode) or to audiobooks and podcasts. Lastly, as I said earlier, Meta tread water on photography this generation, and I'd like to see improvements by next generation: A portrait/ landscape toggle, optional zoom, better postprocessing, or other tricks. If you compare the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 vs. the Oakley Meta HSTN, you'll find they're virtually identical in hardware, differing only in style and Prizm lenses. But the Oakleys are theoretically tough competition if you prefer their aesthetic to Ray-Ban. The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses are more substantially upgraded: you get an extra hour of battery life, louder speakers, IP67 water resistance, and a more centered camera cutout. But they don't blend in like Ray-Bans, they have no Transitions or prescription options, and they're heavier — though the nose pads keep them in place. Then you have to compare the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses against the Gen 2s. Pay twice as much, and you get a built-in HUD for unique apps — map navigation, watching videos, reading messages, etc. — a viewfinder for better photography, and a neural band for gesture controls. But these glasses are notably thicker and heavier, available only in one style and two colors, and in limited stock. You should buy Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) if... You shouldn't buy Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) if... Smart glasses newbies will either like the Ray-Ban style, easy photography, and AI insights, or get scared off by their size. The real question is whether Gen 1 or Stories owners will see enough to upgrade. Aside from battery life, the Gen 2 Ray-Bans won't feel that different from the last generation, but only because Meta has spent two years updating the Gen 1s. They didn't even launch with Meta AI, yet it's now the signature feature. We already know they'll get slow-motion and hyperlapse videos, Garmin integration, better video recording, and one-word commands like "Photo" by the end of 2025. And that should be just the start. Just look at Meta's AI glasses release notes — with eight feature updates so far in 2025 — to see what to expect. Ultimately, you won't find other display-free glasses that balance AI smarts, camera and speaker quality, and classic style so well, and I think Meta has done enough to tempt you to upgrade. However, if you're not convinced, check back in a few months — they might be even better by then. Familiar tools, upgraded The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses have arrived with enhanced battery life, UHD video, and new styles to tempt long-time fans into upgrading. Unless an alternative Oakley style or the Display HUD really tempt you, you won't find a proper smart glasses rival to them. Michael is Android Central's resident expert on wearables and fitness.

Title: AIL round-up: St Mary’s extend lead atop Division 1A table with win at UCD

St Mary’s moved five points clear of the chasing pack atop Division 1A of the All-Ireland League. Ballynahinch, Terenure College and Clontarf are all on 14 points after statement wins, while Lansdowne beat Young Munster 40-35 in the match of the day at Tom Clifford Park. St Mary’s had a bonus point by half-time at UCD when leading 26-10, including a couple of long-range efforts, ultimately scoring seven tries in a 45-24 win. Ex-UCD and Ulster lock Greg Jones and the hard-carrying Dan Goggin had big games. Conor Dean pulled the strings and Mick O’Gara was influential in midfield. Richie Bergin, Rob Gilsenan and Ruairi Shields all scored against their former club, as Mary’s took their haul to 19 points from a possible 20, with what Mark McHugh said was “a professional and clinical” performance. Ballynahinch moved up to second with the day’s standout result, a 25-12 win over Cork Con in Temple Hill. Conor Rankin converted early tries from Ulster winger Aaron Sexton and Chris Gibson. He also landed penalties either side of a Peter Hyland maul try, converted from the touchline by Darragh French, to leave Ballynahinch 20-7 ahead at the break. After Jack Kelleher’s try on the hour, Con had further chances but the visitors’ defence held firm before outhalf Paul Kerr scored from a five-metre scrum. Terenure moved up to third after a second consecutive bonus point win under Carlos Spencer, beating newly-promoted Nenagh Ormond in their first home game of the season, 40-12. Young winger Dan Griffin scored the first of his brace and had Kiwi scrumhalf Griffin Culver in support for the second, but Nenagh reduced the lead to 14-12 by the break. Replacement Joe Coffey finished off a maul before Munster prop Roman Salanoa, making his first start for Nenagh, offloaded for winger Conor McMahon to score. But Terenure pulled clear after hooker Max Russell’s maul try. Culver set up Leinster under-19 backrower Arthur Ashmore on his debut. Offloads by outhalf Aran Egan and Harrison Brewer created Griffin’s slick second before Connacht backrower Oisin McCormack completed the scoring from Will Reilly’s skip pass. Clontarf laid the foundations for their 34-12 bonus-point win at Old Belvedere through their power game, captain Dylan Donnellan scoring his fourth try in four games and 80th in four seasons. The speedy back three of Peter Maher and the O’Grady brothers, Dylan and Alex, combined for one of three unanswered second-half tries. Lansdowne captain Andy Marks was yet again the star in his side’s dramatic win at Young Munster with another brace, the back three of Tom Roche, Sean Galvin, and Leinster Academy youngster Todd Lawlor also scoring. The Cookies trailed 40-21 before tries by Orin Burke and replacement Arron Roulston had them pounding Lansdowne at the death. “Performances have been very good but we’re coming up short,” lamented coach Ger Slattery. Although winless, Munsters have accrued seven bonus points. Long-serving Ulster hooker John Andrew scored a hat-trick on his Instonians debut as they displaced Old Wesley atop the Division 1B table with a 36-14 win at Shaw’s Bridge. In Division 2B, Buccaneers ended a run of 30 consecutive AIL defeats – dating back to a 26-19 victory away to Blackrock in December 2023 – with a 29-21 win in Enniscorthy.

At least, that's the thought behind a warning from Consumer Reports, which wants customers to avoid spending money on televisions that just aren't worth the investment. Yes, even if they come with a very low price tag. The cost of a new television is often remarkably affordable, regardless of the size and resolution of the product in question. This frequently gets attributed to factors such as decreased public demand and high inventory levels. It's also crucial to note that competition is a factor, and some companies produce good-quality TVs that customers feel are worth the investment. The trick for many shoppers is to figure out which brands those are and what price constitutes a good deal. There are a few cheap TV models that Customer Reports repeatedly warns Americans to avoid, and in some cases, a few companies that the review website suggests shoppers should give serious thought to before considering any of their products. That said, not everyone is so harsh on these low-cost offerings. Some reviewers and customers shared positive experiences and comments. Ultimately, it's best to do your own research concerning product specifications, verified user reviews, and available deals. With these thoughts in mind, here are the budget TVs that Consumer Reports has cautioned customers about purchasing. Vizio's TVs are cheap to purchase, thanks in large part to the company's decision to outsource upwards of 99% of its manufacturing. But while that may give Vizio's bottom line a significant boost, the same can't always be said for the quality of their televisions. That was the case for the M65Q6M-K04 model, a 65-inch 4K UHD smart TV, which Consumer Reports warned suffers from deficient contrast, which negatively affects the product's image quality. While some customers were pleased with the LED picture quality relative to the pricing, some customers experienced bizarre glitches, such as horizontal lines, despite their television being relatively new. One buyer complained the M65Q6M-K04 "wouldn't hold a sync." Meanwhile, one perplexed customer said the TV would sometimes turn on by itself. The Vizio M65Q6M-K04 received decent marks from RTINGS for its low input lag, VRR support, and decent response time when gaming. However, the same review found the product to offer a bland viewing experience when watching sports, TV shows, and movies; it could work as a computer monitor, though RTINGS called out its refresh rate of 60Hz. These TVs are sold for as low as $270. Still, this purchase might not be worth it if you are willing to pay a little more to guarantee excellent video quality. Moreover, you might want to pay careful attention to your warranty should you notice any unusual glitches early on. The Toshiba 75C350KU or 75-Class C350 Series is a prime example of the dip in quality that the brand reportedly suffered following its acquisition from Hisense in November 2017. Though Toshiba was previously known for excellent products, such as the still much-loved Satellite laptops, this was not the case with TVs like the 75C350KU model. Currently, you can buy this item starting at $324.99 through Best Buy or $399 at Amazon; the 65-inch version is more cost-friendly at $325 through Amazon. Despite having a 2160p resolution, Consumer Reports gave these 75-inch televisions low marks for poor image quality and mediocre High Dynamic Range (HDR) capabilities. CR weren't alone in their observation, with reviewers from RTINGS.com and PC Mag also calling out issues with the model. For instance, RTINGS shared that the 2023 release had "low peak brightness in SDR and HDR," and "noticeably darker edges on bright scenes of uniform color." Even with such negative reviews, not everything about the 75-Class C350 Series gets discussed negatively. In addition to Amazon Alexa voice control, the Toshiba TV also featured low input lag, an invaluable feature for dedicated gamers. While the cheap price tag and big screen size might make this model seem worth the price, it might be a good idea to compare its specs to similarly sized and priced models from rival brands. RCA is another once-popular brand that Consumer Reports mentioned as having seen better days. As CR notes, RCA was actually responsible for helping to establish the NTSC standards for color television. Yet, things are much different in the 21st century, and this brand is no longer near the top of the pecking order when it comes to TV viewing experience. This is reflected in the reception of the RCA RNSMU6036, a 60-inch LCD 4K UHD TV. In reviewing the TV, Consumer Reports stated that the "HD picture quality falls short," and "near-white highlights are overly peaked, and contrasty." CR also found that the HDR performance was insufficient. "When playing HDR content, the TV does not trigger new picture settings that are optimized for HDR." Although certain audio and visual specs weren't necessarily up to par, CR did give the product credit for having good motion performance, despite lacking a blur reduction feature. This model isn't readily in stock, though in the past it's reportedly been sold for around $300. If you come across this RCA TV for sale, likely at a discount, you might be able to get it even cheaper. However, the scarcity of this product may signal that it's better to find a more positively reviewed alternative that is readily in stock. Westinghouse TVs are often very cheap to buy, and the 24-inch WD24HX1201 is no exception. However, Consumer Reports doesn't think too much of the brand in terms of overall quality. In an article critiquing specific brands, CR acknowledged Westinghouse as a "historic U.S. electronics name" under the ownership of ViacomCBS. Per Consumer Reports, the brand's television sets are licensed through a Chinese company named TongFang, which manufactures Westinghouse TVs through a California factory. Sometimes, customers will see a name and be unaware of any changes that CR warns could impact the actual end product that makes it to market. The Westinghouse WD24HX1201 is extremely cost-friendly, having gone for as low as $51.99 through some retailers. Its small size also makes it ideal for spaces where owning a huge smart HD TV just isn't practical, such as a tiny studio apartment or college dorm room. Despite its convenient size and pricing, some notable issues might be hard to overlook. For instance, while some viewers are pleased with the viewing experience, others reportedly believe the product does not meet full HD standards comparable to other models currently available. Meanwhile, one customer complained that the "sound is terrible," describing it as "tinny" in nature. While CR and similar review sites believe Westinghouse's quality is compromised, the customer will ultimately have the final say regarding experience and value for money. If you prioritize size, convenience, and pricing over quality, this model could be worth it. Otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere for a better-quality TV. In Consumer Reports' breakdown of the 55-inch Vizio M65Q6-L4, the reviewer deemed the HDR performance to be largely "ineffective," stating, "In our tests, the display did not have the peak brightness capability necessary (by HDR standards) to reproduce the extended contrast on our HDR content." Unfortunately, this isn't the only area where CR felt the product fell short, as the reviewer noted that contrast was bad during dark scenes, which made the image appear "flat with no sense of depth." Visual experience aside, Consumer Reports did give the model positive marks for motion blur performance. They also found the TV's sound quality to be about average compared to similar products. The Vizio M65Q6-L4, also known as the Vizio Quantum QLED, was first released in 2023, but since then, review sites like CR and RTINGS have ultimately deemed it to be a mediocre product. RTINGS gave it a 6.5 out of 10 score, noting that the product is highly suitable for use as a PC monitor, but is only a fair to average option for watching TV shows, movies, or gaming. RTINGS did side with Consumer Reports regarding the TV's inferior HDR capabilities, while also mentioning its subpar selection of streaming applications. Despite such criticisms, the Vizio M65Q6-L4 is relatively cheap to buy, priced at $378 on Walmart's website. Whether this purchase will be worth it ultimately comes down to your budget and needs, but for the price, there's a good chance you can find a better bargain. If you were hoping to recommend the Vizio V555-J01 as an alternative to the poorly received M65Q6-L4, then Consumer Reports' review of this particular model could give you pause. Part of the V5 series of Vizio smart TVs, this product unfortunately has similar design issues to the Quantum QLED. For example, CR found it to have poor HDR performance with flat screen imagery. However, the V555-J01 model also has some sound quality issues. Consumer Reports said the audio performance might work for typical television viewing, but that "its shortcomings would be obvious with movie soundtracks and music." Even with the warnings from review sites like CR, some customers found the Vizeo TV to be worth the purchase. The product is currently selling at $311.99 at Best Buy, where customers rate the model 4.4 out of 5. Satisfied buyers reportedly love the price and the ease of setup. Interestingly, most customers outright disagreed with Consumer Reports' take on the image quality, finding it to be very good. This reception could of course be tied to perceived value for money and what many purchasers expect for the related price tag. This is likely going to be a situation where your desire for a bargain will impact your perception of a brand and its products. Vizio has established itself as a brand that sells very affordable TVs. If you prefer cheap TVs, you may be satisfied here. That said, if you are seeking better reviewed TVs with higher end specifications, you will likely want to try a different brand and TV model. The Westinghouse WD24HX1201 is a 24-inch model with a 768p resolution that ultimately left a lot to be desired. According to Consumer Reports, the TV has only a single HDMI and USB port, which is notable since smaller laptops often come with more USB ports. If the connection options leave you unimpressed, the viewing experience might not be much better. CR felt the color accuracy was below the quality demonstrated by rival brands, and that the "black levels were merely okay." Contrast was also below standards compared to the results found testing similar TVs. Lastly, Consumer Reports found the model to have a narrow viewing angle that offered a "below average performance" relative to other televisions. Although Consumer Reports finds the Westinghouse brand to be lacking compared to top TV brands, customers are willing to overlook quality issues and have given the TV positive feedback on the official website. They not only uploaded images of their TVs, but also repeatedly praised the model for being easy to set up and use. There were also repeated mentions of how satisfied they were with the product for the purchase price. Similar sentiments were expressed by customers who bought the television through Best Buy. While availability can vary, the WD24HX1201 model can be found for sale starting at $115.99 on websites like Walmart and Amazon. As was the case with Vizio, it may be that Westinghouse is a brand that consumers associate with bargain shopping, and so aren't going to hold it to the rigorous standards applied by Consumer Reports. That said, quality-minded shoppers will probably heed CR's warning and pass on this Westinghouse product. Consumer Reports isn't impressed with RCA, despite many of its TVs being affordably priced. Although the site has not directly reviewed the 50-inch RLDED5098-UHD model, CR's past warnings about RCA's brand and related quality appear to reflect how purchasers have come to see this television. For example, over 2,000 Walmart customers gave the TV an overall rating of 3.7 out of 5. Some customers were highly unsatisfied with the 2160p LED TV, opting to leave scathing 2- and 1-star reviews. Some purchasers complained about sound quality. A reviewer named Patricia, who left a 2-star review, claimed that the audio "was going in and out." Other 2-star reviewers complained about the difficulty in picking up channels and found the accompanying remote to be too small. Other notable reviews mentioned a terrible "burning" smell. More than half of the reviews for the RLDED5098-UHD were ultimately quite positive, with many bringing up the low price as a plus. That aside, the complaints about various shortcomings strongly reflect overall quality issues that Consumer Reports has mentioned that some brands like RCA struggle with, especially as ownership of the brand name has passed to companies that do not consistently produce top quality TVs.

Title: Microsoft Reports Earnings This Week: Here's What Investors Need To Know

Microsoft is slated to report quarterly results after markets close Wednesday, and Wall Street analysts expect another solid showing. “We view MSFT as the clear front-runner on the enterprise hyper-scale AI front despite increasing competition from Amazon/AWS and Google/GCP,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note last week. Analysts expect Microsoft to report adjusted earnings grew 11% to $3.68 per share in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Wall Street is looking for revenue from Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, to increase by about 38% to around $23 billion, while total revenue is expected to increase 15% to $75.5 billion. With its array of businesses spanning cloud computing, enterprise software and personal computing, Microsoft’s earnings can signal both the strength of AI demand and the health of the broader economy. As America’s third-most valuable company, Microsoft's stock has a greater impact than most on investors’ portfolios. Many analysts say anecdotal evidence points to an even stronger quarter than Wall Street is expecting. The feedback Deutsche Bank analysts have received from Microsoft customers “reflects an overwhelmingly positive consensus on Microsoft's fundamental and competitive standing,” they wrote in a note Thursday. Citi analysts also noted their conversations with Microsoft partners were resoundingly positive, with corporate and public customers indicating strong demand for Azure. Bank of America analysts are forecasting total first-quarter revenue of $77 billion, but expect as much as 1% upside to that estimate, “driven by workload migration to Azure, strength in security and applications.” Wedbush concurred, calling Microsoft's forecast of 37% Azure growth "relatively conservative." Microsoft is coming off a very strong earnings report in July, when it beat top- and bottom-line estimates and indicated cloud computing demand continued to outstrip supply. To meet that demand, the company estimated it would spend $30 billion on infrastructure in the most recent quarter. Microsoft’s infrastructure spending will be one of the most closely watched figures in this week’s results. Its spending on cloud and AI data centers has fueled exponential sales growth at chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). This week’s earnings from Microsoft and big tech peers Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) will give Wall Street insight into the strength of the quarter for Nvidia and other AI infrastructure suppliers. Bank of America analysts expect Microsoft’s full-year capital expenditures will total $125 billion, $10 billion more than the Wall Street consensus. “We are bullish on upward revisions to Microsoft's CapEx, which would likely be a catalyst for the stock,” the analysts wrote. Microsoft shares have treaded water since popping on last quarter’s earnings report. The stock is down about 2% since the end of July, while the Nasdaq Composite is up nearly 10%. BofA attributes the underperformance to a shift in “AI infrastructure momentum away from Microsoft (to Oracle),” which last quarter reported a massive jump in orders from Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Saying that infrastructure spending will exceed prior estimates could help Microsoft regain that momentum, according to BofA. Uncertainty about Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI has also been an overhang for the stock, according to Deutsche Bank. The two companies last month signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to extend their partnership, but much remains to be negotiated, including Microsoft’s access to OpenAI’s intellectual property and programming interfaces, as well as how ownership of OpenAI’s for-profit division will be structured. “How things may shake out across these key pillars is unclear, but we believe skeptics are underappreciating Microsoft's strong position to extract value here,” wrote Deutsche Bank’s Brad Zelnick and Bhavin Shah.

Title: The AI boom is keeping employees well paid. It's also not letting them go anywhere.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. It's gotta be the shoes! Why else would people be willing to drop at least $1,100 on a pair of sneakers? I'd never shell out that much but I am tempted to go try on Wall Street's favorite pair of kicks. On the agenda today: But first: Are you leaving the money on the table? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Imagine you work for a company and your stock price has just skyrocketed. Think Nvidia, up more than 1,100% over the past few years to become a $4.5 trillion company. Or Broadcom and AMD, two other chipmakers whose shares are surging in the AI boom. Employees of these companies must be feeling pretty good right about now. What could possibly go wrong? As is often the case, though, there is a catch. In this instance, it's known as "golden handcuffs" — the notion of feeling stuck because it's too risky or expensive to move or change. These compensation packages often include restricted stock units, or RSUs. Those who decide to leave their companies could forfeit any unvested stock, meaning they could miss out on a substantial form of compensation — potentially worth millions of dollars. My colleagues Geoff Weiss, Hugh Langley, and Rosalie Chan wrote this weekend about the latest golden handcuff trend sweeping through Silicon Valley, particularly at the AI chip companies. In one case, they reported that an equity package of $420,000 given to an Nvidia employee in 2023 is worth almost $2 million today, citing data from Levels.fyi. Even a more modest $66,000 RSU package reported by a Broadcom employee in 2023 has jumped in value to around $267,000. Stock payouts unlock over time. Quitting before shares vest can potentially mean leaving a substantial amount of money on the table. Although, it's worth noting that if you quit or lose your job, those unvested RSUs disappear. Companies use restricted stock as a retention tactic. It's one that has been utilized from Wall Street to Big Tech, with a similar dynamic now occurring in the AI boom. Consider the employee churn rates at these chipmakers. Nvidia said in its annual sustainability report that its turnover rate has been cut in half over the past few years, adding that "RSUs promote retention." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy. Similarly, Broadcom said its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is "below the technology industry benchmark." It cited equity awards as a "powerful long-term retention incentive." This is the conundrum for chipmaker employees right now. Walk away and forfeit millions for a new opportunity? Or stay? For the last 20 years, Mark Zuckerberg has been the world's Minister of Thought. Starting with Facebook, the Meta CEO has transformed how we view ourselves and each other. Now, Zuckerberg appears to be ceding that title to OpenAI's Sam Altman. ChatGPT is only three years old and has more than 800 million weekly users — about 40 times more than Facebook's audience during its first three years. If the past two decades were about curating who we are, the future may be about creating who we want to be. From pokes to prompts. Dimitri Semenikhin is the 29-year-old day trader whose thesis helped spark a massive rally in Beyond Meat. The day trader is a Moscow native who lived in Monaco and was schooled in London. He previously launched a luxury travel startup called Yacht Harbour, and is currently the CEO of his family's real-estate development firm. And while he's leaned into it at times, he said he's not Roaring Kitty 2.0. What makes Semenikhin and Beyond different. At the video-game giant Electronic Arts, management is gung-ho on AI. Workers, on the other hand, say AI is actually making their jobs harder — and they fear it could be game over if they're training their replacement. AI has been a part of video games for some time: when you play "Madden" you're competing against a computer-controlled team, for instance. But the modern AI affecting game design is different, and it's widening the gap between bosses and employees. Player v. player.

Title: Meta Is Set to Report Earnings on Wednesday—What You Need to Know

Meta has big AI goals, but can it convince investors to keep supporting its big spending? The company's progress with AI will be in focus when the social media giant reports third-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, with investors likely to be watching closely for signs its investments are paying off. Meta Platforms (META), which expanded its capital expenditures projections twice this year to support its data center buildouts and hefty compensation packages for poached AI talent, could now face a higher bar to impress with its results. Bank of America analysts said last week they're calling for a revenue beat of $50 billion driven by ad gains to support Meta's spending, slightly above the Street consensus compiled by Visible Alpha at $49.54 billion—which would represent a record high. Meanwhile, the mean estimate for Meta's earnings per share at $6.71 would suggest year-over-year growth, but a decline from the previous quarter. Recent reports of layoffs and hiring freezes could point to some signs of strain in Meta's efforts to rein in costs. Meta has been more successful than many of its other big tech peers so far this year in convincing investors to support its AI goals. Thursday's results could represent the next big test to show it's made the revenue gains to justify its spending. Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the social media giant's stock heading into the results, with all but one of the 21 analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha calling it a "buy" compared to just one "hold" rating. Their mean price target near $873 would suggest roughly 18% upside from Friday's close. The stock has added over one-quarter of its value in 2025, making it one of the better-performing members of the Magnificent 7, behind Nvidia (NVDA) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).

Meta has big AI goals, but can it convince investors to keep supporting its big spending? The company's progress with AI will be in focus when the social media giant reports third-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, with investors likely to be watching closely for signs its investments are paying off. Meta Platforms (META), which expanded its capital expenditures projections twice this year to support its data center buildouts and hefty compensation packages for poached AI talent, could now face a higher bar to impress with its results. Bank of America analysts said last week they're calling for a revenue beat of $50 billion driven by ad gains to support Meta's spending, slightly above the Street consensus compiled by Visible Alpha at $49.54 billion—which would represent a record high. Meanwhile, the mean estimate for Meta's earnings per share at $6.71 would suggest year-over-year growth, but a decline from the previous quarter. Recent reports of layoffs and hiring freezes could point to some signs of strain in Meta's efforts to rein in costs. Meta has been more successful than many of its other big tech peers so far this year in convincing investors to support its AI goals. Thursday's results could represent the next big test to show it's made the revenue gains to justify its spending. Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the social media giant's stock heading into the results, with all but one of the 21 analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha calling it a "buy" compared to just one "hold" rating. Their mean price target near $873 would suggest roughly 18% upside from Friday's close. The stock has added over one-quarter of its value in 2025, making it one of the better-performing members of the Magnificent 7, behind Nvidia (NVDA) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its busiest week, which includes an earnings report from five of the Magnificent 7 and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B). 173 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Boeing (BA), Kraft Heinz (KHC), ServiceNow (NOW), Merck (MRK), Mastercard (MA), Chevron (CVX), and Exxon Mobil (XOM). With 29% of companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. The earnings season preview from last week contains more details about the underlying drivers of earnings. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 9.2% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar years 2025 and 2026 is unchanged at 11.0% and 13.9%, respectively. The continuation of the strong earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. In addition, the better-than-expected consumer inflation reading opened the door to a Federal Reserve rate cut this week, which helped stocks, particularly banks. The lack of additional “cockroaches” last week helped regional banks snap back from concerns over reported loan fraud. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla’s (TSLA) earnings were below expectations last week, and it was the only member of the Magnificent 7 that saw a stock price decline last week. Five of the Magnificent 7 report earnings this week: Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) after the close on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) after the close on Thursday. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises from companies in the financials, information technology, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to the S&P 500’s earnings growth rate increase last week. Within financials, Capital One Financial (COF) and Chubb (CB) were the most significant positive drivers. Intel (INTC) was the most crucial positive surprise in technology, while RTX (RTX) and GE Aerospace (GE) were the most notable positive surprises in industrials. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. However, sales growth at 7.0% is running well above expectations. So far this earnings season, the consumer discretionary and financials sectors have been the most critical drivers of improved sales growth. The government shutdown delayed September consumer inflation (CPI) readings, but the headline and core, excluding food and energy, were better than expected. The headline and core CPI were 3% year-over-year. The top-line numbers were more favorable than expected, despite concerns about price pressure from tariffs. In addition, the details were similarly comforting, with the pace of price gains for services and housing slowing. The 3-month annualized rate of CPI growth held steady, suggesting the recent inflation acceleration might be subsiding. With the government shutdown dragging on and delaying or withholding many US economic releases, the focus will be on the busiest week of the earnings season. In addition, five of the Magnificent 7 companies report earnings. This group has an outsized impact on the S&P 500’s expected earnings growth rate. It is also an essential bellwether for gauging the health of the artificial intelligence boom and the technology sector as a whole. Despite the government shutdown, tariffs, and a cooling labor market, the economy continues to hold up well, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 4%. President Trump is scheduled to meet with China’s President Xi this week, and markets anticipate some thawing in tensions between the countries, though a full-scale trade deal is unlikely. The friendlier inflation data last week sealed the deal for another 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) at their meeting on Wednesday. Financial markets expect another cut at the December meeting. Given the additional economic visibility issues arising from the government shutdown, management’s forward earnings guidance will be even more closely watched. Since the Fed rate cut is a virtual certainty, Chair Powell’s comments about the future path of monetary policy will be closely watched. He is unlikely to be forceful in his views, given the lack of visibility into the health of the labor market, but shouldn’t buck expectations for another Fed easing in December.

Title: Chipmakers Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom are slapping 'golden handcuffs' on workers to meet demand for the AI boom

Every time Hugh publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's cuffing season for chipmakers. As their valuations skyrocket on the back of the AI boom, so do pay packages for employees whose compensation is tied to stock price. Some are anticipating paydays worth millions of dollars. There's one catch: Stock payouts unlock over time, rewarding employees who stay with the company longer — and penalizing those who skip out sooner. One Nvidia employee who plans to leave when their equity vests told Business Insider that doing so before would have a "big cost," adding, "If I wanted to leave now, I do not think I can command the salary I have now with another company." It's a tactic that tech giants, such as Amazon and Google, have used for years to retain employees. Now that chipmakers are striking big deals to meet the growing demand for powering AI, the golden handcuffs at the US's three largest — Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom — are tightening. Business Insider spoke about the impact of these packages with six current and former employees at Nvidia and Broadcom who are not authorized to speak to the press. Since both companies have over 36,000 employees receiving a variety of compensation structures, we also worked with Levels.fyi, which tracks employee compensation more broadly in Silicon Valley. It could take up to four years for some to get the full payout. However, the skyrocketing value of stock awards means some employees are already earning buckets of compensation, which in Nvidia's case has tipped some to coast into a "semi-retirement" mode. "A lot of them have families," one Nvidia employee said, "and they probably think logically like, 'Who am I to walk away from this job that guarantees that my kids will never have student debt?'" The stock growth of chipmakers Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD since January 2023 has outpaced that of other tech giants, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. "Aside from Meta, even the 'poorest' performing AI chip company (AMD) has outpaced the rest of Big Tech in these past two years," said Hakeem Shibly, a data analyst at Levels.fyi. One Broadcom employee, who estimated that their restricted stock units, or RSUs, are valued at over six times their salary, said, "Given the recent rise of the share price, people who have been able to hold on to their shares will now be looking forward to a very comfortable retirement." In one case, an equity package of $488,000 given to an Nvidia employee in 2023 is now worth more than $2.2 million, according to Levels data. Even a more modest $66,000 RSU package reported by a Broadcom employee in 2023 has jumped in value to around $265,000. Business Insider spoke to a former Broadcom employee who said they lost unvested RSUs when they were let go from the company last year. They estimate their vested RSUs are now worth half a million dollars, but if they were still at Broadcom, their total RSU package would now be worth about $3 million. In some of the user-submitted data provided by Levels.fyi, the value of several Nvidia employees' equity grants has risen over 350% since their hire date in 2023, but because they're not fully vested, they would risk walking away from more than $500,000. Likewise, at Broadcom, the grants of several employees have increased by over 300% since 2023, with many holding RSU packages worth millions, according to Levels data. Two Broadcom employees said theirs were worth over $6 million each. One Nvidia employee said RSUs have created a "lottery winner syndrome," meaning that it feels unlikely to find a similarly lucrative opportunity elsewhere. "The golden handcuffs are RSUs," the former Broadcom employee said. "No one's going to put in their notice now to go to other opportunities." Leaders inside the chip giants are well aware of how powerful these packages are for retaining talent. Nvidia said that "RSUs promote retention" in its annual sustainability report and said its turnover rate has more than halved, from 5.3% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2025. CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy, and the company said that 20% of employees have been there for 10 years, while 40% have been there for more than five years. Likewise, Broadcom reported that its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is "below the technology industry benchmark." It cited equity awards as a "powerful long-term retention incentive," saying it has "historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees." The Nvidia employees said that since the RSUs of longer-time employees are worth more than those of newer employees, the disparities are sometimes openly discussed. One employee said some managers who have been with the company for a long time — and whose shares are worth exponentially more — "are just resting and vesting." The other employee said that those whose RSUs are worth more could be more incentivized to go above and beyond, including working more intensely or being less likely to push back in meetings. According to Levels data, Nvidia has started using a method used by Google, Uber, DoorDash, and Pinterest in recent years, which is to "front-load" its vesting schedules. This means employees receive the biggest chunk of their equity in their first year at the company. Similar to a signing bonus, front-loading can be a valuable tool for attracting top talent. It also ties financial rewards more closely to employee performance, as tech employees often receive additional stock awards after their first year of work. After that, if an employee's performance is poor, they're more likely to see diminished payouts. Smaller pay packages handed out at these AI hardware companies have also become incredibly lucrative. Employees may get more equity in lieu of a higher salary or bonuses — and for some of those working at the chip giants right now, that's OK. "In private conversations I've had with others," another former Broadcom employee said, "they're quite pleased with RSUs." Jump to

In one case, an equity package of $488,000 given to an Nvidia employee in 2023 is now worth more than $2.2 million, according to Levels data. Even a more modest $66,000 RSU package reported by a Broadcom employee in 2023 has jumped in value to around $265,000. Business Insider spoke to a former Broadcom employee who said they lost unvested RSUs when they were let go from the company last year. They estimate their vested RSUs are now worth half a million dollars, but if they were still at Broadcom, their total RSU package would now be worth about $3 million. In some of the user-submitted data provided by Levels.fyi, the value of several Nvidia employees' equity grants has risen over 350% since their hire date in 2023, but because they're not fully vested, they would risk walking away from more than $500,000. Likewise, at Broadcom, the grants of several employees have increased by over 300% since 2023, with many holding RSU packages worth millions, according to Levels data. Two Broadcom employees said theirs were worth over $6 million each. One Nvidia employee said RSUs have created a "lottery winner syndrome," meaning that it feels unlikely to find a similarly lucrative opportunity elsewhere. "The golden handcuffs are RSUs," the former Broadcom employee said. "No one's going to put in their notice now to go to other opportunities." Leaders inside the chip giants are well aware of how powerful these packages are for retaining talent. Nvidia said that "RSUs promote retention" in its annual sustainability report and said its turnover rate has more than halved, from 5.3% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2025. CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy, and the company said that 20% of employees have been there for 10 years, while 40% have been there for more than five years. Likewise, Broadcom reported that its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is "below the technology industry benchmark." It cited equity awards as a "powerful long-term retention incentive," saying it has "historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees." The Nvidia employees said that since the RSUs of longer-time employees are worth more than those of newer employees, the disparities are sometimes openly discussed. One employee said some managers who have been with the company for a long time — and whose shares are worth exponentially more — "are just resting and vesting." The other employee said that those whose RSUs are worth more could be more incentivized to go above and beyond, including working more intensely or being less likely to push back in meetings. According to Levels data, Nvidia has started using a method used by Google, Uber, DoorDash, and Pinterest in recent years, which is to "front-load" its vesting schedules. This means employees receive the biggest chunk of their equity in their first year at the company. Similar to a signing bonus, front-loading can be a valuable tool for attracting top talent. It also ties financial rewards more closely to employee performance, as tech employees often receive additional stock awards after their first year of work. After that, if an employee's performance is poor, they're more likely to see diminished payouts. Smaller pay packages handed out at these AI hardware companies have also become incredibly lucrative. Employees may get more equity in lieu of a higher salary or bonuses — and for some of those working at the chip giants right now, that's OK. "In private conversations I've had with others," another former Broadcom employee said, "they're quite pleased with RSUs." Jump to

Title: How JPMorgan’s Bitcoin collateral plan could unlock $20 billion in liquidity

As Wall Street giant JPMorgan recognizably embraces crypto assets as loan collateral, industry observers predict a ripple effect among banking institutions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. After years of tension between crypto and traditional finance, a symbolic shift is taking shape inside the world’s largest bank. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is reportedly preparing to let institutional clients use Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral for cash loans. This means the bank’s borrowers can pledge the two top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, which would be held by approved third-party custodians like Coinbase. The initiative is expected to roll out by the end of 2025. This move is significantly ironic considering the financial giant’s CEO Jamie Dimon is a renowned crypto critic. Notably, he has previously described Bitcoin as a “fraud.” However, increased demands for the emerging industry has forced his hands to support these product launches by his firm. JPMorgan’s move could quietly rewrite the boundaries between digital assets and regulated credit markets. According to Galaxy Research data, open centralized-finance (CeFi) borrows totaled $17.78 billion as of June 30, up 15% quarter-over-quarter and 147% year-over-year. When decentralized loans are included, total outstanding collateralized crypto credit reached $53.09 billion in Q2 2025. This is the third-highest figure on record. These numbers point to a structural shift where borrowing activity rises as digital-asset prices increases. This results in improved credit spreads making loans more attractive for traders and treasuries. Moreover, corporate firms are also tapping crypto-backed lending to fund operations, replacing equity issuance with secured debt against digital assets. In that context, JPMorgan’s entry looks less like an experiment and more like a decisive institutional catch-up move in the emerging industry. Considering this, crypto researcher Shanaka Anslem Perera estimates the model could unlock $10 billion to $20 billion in immediate lending capacity for hedge funds, corporate treasuries, and large asset managers seeking dollar liquidity without selling their tokens. In practical terms, that means firms can now raise capital against digital assets the same way they would against US Treasuries or blue-chip equities. While crypto-collateralized lending is familiar inside DeFi protocols and smaller CeFi lenders, JPMorgan’s participation institutionalizes the concept. The bank’s entry signals that digital assets have matured enough to meet global finance’s compliance, custody, and risk-management standards. Matt Sheffield, the CIO of Ethereum-focused treasury firm SharpLink, believes the development could reshape balance sheet management across asset managers and funds. According to him: “Many traditional financial institutions who rely on trading with banks to date need to choose between holding spot ETH OR other positions. The largest investment bank in the world is here to change that. With the ability to borrow against positions held in third-party custodians, you can build a more productive portfolio, increasing the value of the collateral asset. “ Meanwhile, the decision also strengthens JPMorgan’s broader crypto posture. Over the past two years, the bank has built out Onyx, its blockchain-based settlement network, processed billions in tokenized payments, and explored digital-asset repo transactions. Accepting BTC and ETH as loan collateral completes the loop: issuance, settlement, and credit, all of which touch the blockchain rails. Considering this, Sheffield predicts the move will trigger a “competitive cascade” among large banks. He noted: “This starts a wave. Being first is what scares large institutions. The rest will follow with the decision de-risked, because no action would leave them uncompetitive.” Already, rivals like Citi and Goldman Sachs have expanded digital-asset custody and repo initiatives. BlackRock, meanwhile, has integrated tokenized treasuries (BUIDL) into its fund ecosystem, while Fidelity has doubled its institutional crypto desk headcount this year. Despite Wall Street’s growing embrace of digital assets, challenges remain. Banks entering this market must navigate the intrinsic volatility of cryptocurrencies, uncertain regulatory capital treatment, and persistent counterparty risk—all of which constrain how aggressively they can expand crypto-backed lending. US regulators have yet to issue clear capital-weighting guidelines for digital collateral, leaving institutions to rely on conservative internal models. Even with third-party custodians managing custody risk, supervisory oversight is expected to remain intense. Still, the trajectory is unmistakable because digital assets are gradually being woven into the fabric of global credit markets. Bitcoin analyst Joe Consoerti said these moves show that: “The global financial system is slowly recollateralizing itself around the highest quality asset known to man.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Anne Enright: ‘I’m in a lull. I’m trying to recalibrate after a long decade of elder care’

Time Published: 2025-10-26T05:31:00Z
Full Content:
“I’m in a bit of a lull,” Anne Enright says when I ask what she’s working on. “You wait for a catch, a snag to your interest. “The wonderful Annie Dillard has a story about an Inuit woman who has a baby to feed and no fish, so she slices tiny bits of her own thigh as bait. ‘This is what a writer does,’ she says. That’s Annie Dillard, though, not me.” But the New Yorker magazine recently published Enright’s short story The Bridge Stood Fast, and Jonathan Cape a brilliant career retrospective of her nonfiction, Attention, reflecting on her life, writers and art, and Ireland and the world, so she has been not idle but taking stock. “I’m in a lull because of the world, probably also because my parents are both gone – and the family home. I’m trying to recalibrate after a long decade of elder care for me and my siblings.” Enright’s mother, Cora, died in November 2023, her father, Donal, in June 2016, a few months before Donald Trump was first elected US president. “I lost a wonderful man from my life while the world gained a terrible one,” she wrote in an essay in No Authority, a collection from 2019 of her writings as the inaugural laureate of Irish fiction, in which she addressed, among other things, misogyny and male privilege. “I knew many good men and very few bad ones. Was this male goodness also illusory? What, I wondered, came between these individual, well-intentioned men and the wider enactment of equality?” She reprises the subject in fictional form in her New Yorker story. “Even though the story is set in the 1980s, you want to feel it is saying something relevant to now. The world is so different, you want to meet that change in some way. The story is very strongly based on me going down to Clare with my dad, picking blackberries and mushrooms. I wanted to capture that fantastic thing of having your dad all to yourself when you were 11. Any girl who is stuck on their da, I had access to that easily.” [ Anne Enright: ‘People that go around complaining they don’t win prizes … I always think of Trump and Georgia’Opens in new window ] In the story, the father suddenly has to leave, and a darker masculinity takes centre stage. It asks, if men are more or less good, how did we get saddled with such a damaged patriarchy? There is also an undercurrent of Ireland’s urban-rural divide. Enright once found the New Yorker’s fiction editors “almost anti-voice”, wanting to turn colourful sentences beige, but she has always admired its editing as “a lesson in clarity, foregrounding things the reader needs to know”, one she passes on to her students at University College Dublin, where she is professor of creative writing. “Don’t be hiding things under your jumper. There’s something you’re not telling.” I realised that the people who didn’t like you weren’t going to like you because you won the Booker: they were going to dislike you more Enright has enjoyed consistent critical success since her debut short-story collection, The Portable Virgin, from 1991, won the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature. Winning the Booker Prize, with The Gathering, from 2005, made her name internationally. “It was fantastic timing. It very much did its job for me.” She didn’t think she had written a Booker winner. “I was rearing small kids and locked away for a few hours a day in Bray. I was hauling it out of my guts and thought, No one is going to like this.” The late Irish Times literary critic Eileen Battersby was unimpressed. Enright says, “I realised that the people who didn’t like your work weren’t going to change their minds because you won the Booker: they were going to dislike your work more.” In my view she has reached another level with her three most recent novels, The Green Road, Actress and The Wren, The Wren. But despite being up for the Women’s Prize for Fiction five times, “you just know that’s not going to happen. The magic is moving elsewhere,” with “a shift to a cooler female voice”. “You outgrow ideas of fashionability. Writing the sort of book I write, which is interested in style and language, how the sentences fall, it used to be called literary, but things shift. Style in some mouths is a semi-insult. I’m not second-guessing the market. That is the enemy of good writing and a sure way to fail. “There are times late at night you think you’re no good at all, but you learn to live with the uncertainty. Usually for me it’s a structural flaw or unease. I’d break it up or smooth it out a bit. In The Green Road and The Gathering, there are tensions between the book falling apart and coming together. I sometimes wish I could write a book in one style and one voice the whole way through.” All this made winning the $175,000 Windham-Campbell Prize this year a huge and welcome surprise. “I thought those days were gone.” “You always finish a book too quickly,” she says, although she has never worked to a deadline since her debut novel, The Wig My Father Wore, from 1995, “which I missed by two years. I was very neurotic about it in the early days. I wrote with great difficulty. I wrote every day for 30 years. I need to. I’m slightly obsessive and addicted to it.” She usually has two or three nonfiction deadlines, however – work she takes on if she believes it will bring her fiction or thinking on. [ Anne Enright on Edna O’Brien: She never left Ireland, yet couldn’t live here eitherOpens in new window ] “Stylistically, Wig is not showing its age. Is that a very arrogant thing to say? I noticed my New Yorker story is doing what I do, moving from paragraph to paragraph faster than other writers. On one level it is naturalistic, but I can sense that old energy from the first story in The Portable Virgin is still there. “I thought I want to stop doing that now, but it still is the engine that keeps me going, that movement into surprise, the way that the paragraph ends in a way that you don’t expect from its beginning, so there is a bit of a dance going on. I’m not writing modernism like Tom McCarthy, but I’m not writing like William Trevor, either, so there is a conversation between the two.” Enright recognises that some of her novels are couples: The Gathering and The Green Road; Actress and The Wren, The Wren. “They are bookends. They talk to each other. You realise at the end [of writing a novel] that you haven’t done at all what you meant to – if I knew that’s what I was going to do, I would have started out differently – and so you do start out differently.” I wasn’t expecting to be asked about suicidal thoughts 40 years in my past, but I suppose I have always skirted around the difficult feelings of those years Both Actress and The Wren, The Wren “have mythological, supernormal parents. They have a glow, given them by fame, which is shorthand for how we feel about our parents anyway. In The Wren, The Wren I had the advantage of being able to make [Phil the poet] real by making his work real, and so it was a completely different engagement [than with Actress], more exciting. You could give him go, let him have his say. “I’m a great believer in that, which is one of the reasons why my books tend to not fragment but collate, because they have a democratic impulse behind them. You can demonise Phil – he is every kind of foolish bad man – but once you get him speaking you can also experience him. Maybe 20 per cent of my readers on a good day would be male, but I’ve had a good male response to the Phil chapters. My work is political but not ideological.” In other words, it is polyphonic, not just one point of view. [ Anne Enright: ‘I am a proud Dubliner, born and reared. I spurn these lyrical types yearning for the rural’Opens in new window ] Enright reminds me that during the first pandemic lockdown she surprised me by picking a collection of poetry translated from Irish as her summer read. “Poems like The Yellow Bittern and To a Blackbird were moving and also key to my writing The Wren, The Wren. Now the thickets of misogyny are being cleared from Irish letters, I’ve been going back to Irish poetry, a reclamation. “For decades there was almost a hum off Irish work that was not for or about you. I became tired of having to praise it, the lie that it contains, the women’s lives trapped by that sentimentality. But you can’t be too cross when you sit down to write something. You have to let the feeling settle and then go back to reaccess it.” I ask to see Enright’s writing desk, and she surprises me by sitting cross-legged on the sofa in a basement room, where she types on her laptop: “Slow slow, quick quick slow. It’s more of a rhythm, a rush and a stop. Writing by hand feels like a voiceover; this is more in the moment.” Dialogue, she says, shouldn’t all be the same length unless you’re Beckett or Pinter. There is always a power dynamic or a kind of dance going on. “I am very interested in the pattern of interruptions. Women interrupt to be helpful; men interrupt as a territorial thing.” She writes about Ireland but not for it, she says. “I’m very proud of the fact I had the 46A [bus] in every single book. Now it’s gone, I don’t know what to do. I don’t think I can put the E2 in.” To write precisely about the imprecise, often ambiguous nature of things is one of Enright’s gifts, so it is no surprise when I ask where she grew up to learn that it was on the borders of Perrystown, Terenure and Templeogue – “postally Dublin 12, religiously Crumlin, and Terenure for the estate agents” – where the Dublin bus stopped and fields began. [ Goodbye to the 46A: End of legendary Dublin bus route made famous in songOpens in new window ] As for class? “It’s an evolving space for me,” she says. “No one along the Dart line, which is so class-bound, believes this, but we were, as far as I knew, indifferent to class. Possibly because we were an academic family, a lot of investment went into that.” Her parents were both civil servants, but with five children to raise, their house was very modest. “My mother came from a falling class – middle class with no money, because her father died just before she was born. She had a Catholic spiritual sense that people were people and shouldn’t be judged for what they had. A lid would be put on notions. “The English novel of a certain decade is obsessed with class, and I’m not interested – those power relations are not my concern – but I am very interested in people’s notions of themselves, and notions in the Irish sense.” She always does a deep dive into her characters’ backgrounds. “I do know where people come from, how they place themselves socially, but then I lose all that and focus on something else about their lives.” Enright was a precocious child. She won a Kodak Instamatic camera for a national essay competition when she was 11. She preferred Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland to The Wind in the Willows, playful and ludic like her father, but disappointing her mother. “It was news to me that reading could be the wrong sort.” Had she been a boy she wouldn’t have been allowed to be a writer, she has said. “I did cause a lot of maternal anxiety. But my father said, ‘I don’t know what she has, but she has something.’” She passed her Leaving Cert at 16, then won a scholarship to a school in Canada, whose headmaster predicted that she would blow the world up with her writing – an unfortunate metaphor. He was not the last male critic to displease her. “I had absolutely no money, and there were lots of people with lots of money, who dressed with confidence, who had travelled.” She studied English at Trinity College Dublin. She tried her hand at writing monologues and acting with friends – Lynn Parker, Pauline McLynn, Declan Hughes – who would form Rough Magic Theatre Company, and Martin Murphy, whom she would marry. She graduated with a first. “When I was trying to place myself as a future writer, I wasn’t thinking of Irish writers at all, but once you go out in the world you are obliged to talk about nothing else. I read all the Frank O’Connors as a child, just reading for pleasure what was in the house, Robert Coover, Donald Barthelme, Marguerite Duras, the modernists. “I was in a state of contention with writers like John McGahern, a kind of argument which is also a very strong connection. I felt he became a little too like his father even while rejecting him, that he was quite paternalistic. For the most part he rose above his damage with considerable grace, but I have an issue sometimes with how his language is laid on the page.” Enright then started writing fragments, a form that the French literary theorist Roland Barthes writes about as having the constant pleasure of beginnings, without arc or resolution. “It works by juxtaposition. It’s a scrap. Wig narratively relied on collage, the feeling that things are either making new meanings or breaking down.” In 1986 she won a scholarship to the University of East Anglia, or UEA, in Norwich, “the back of beyond, middle-class to the max”, for a master’s degree in creative writing taught by Angela Carter and Malcolm Bradbury. Carter nourished the work but was a little condescending. “She asked why I wanted to go back to Ireland – clearly, for her, a very backward, provincial place. If you wanted to be a writer, go to London. I was a bit too Irish for them, unrepressed, a bit of an alien species. But when I fell apart they were very nice.” [ ‘It’s a phenomenon - we’re very privileged’: Contemporary Irish women writers celebrated at symposium in MexicoOpens in new window ] What went wrong? “Young people nowadays know staying up all night is not a good idea. I lived in an evil little room, never went for a walk. There was a lot of student depression. I worked from 8pm to 4am. I lost words. I had no idea what I was writing.” It sounds a bit like Jack Nicholson in The Shining, I say. She laughs. “There was a bit of Barton Fink going on. I was very isolated. I didn’t go down to London. I had no money – £3,000 to get through the year, totally scraping by. Someone offered me a lift to London, then, like a nice English person, turned round and asked me for petrol money, after leaving me in the wrong part of town. “I was increasingly unwell. There were other difficulties. I wasn’t particularly in touch with my family at the time. I do remember people thought you were funny and therefore couldn’t be sad. My counsellor just laughed and laughed. A lot of my 20s were rocky, one way or another.” Ten pages from the end of Making Babies, her memoir of early motherhood from 2006, she quietly drops the bombshell that on Easter Monday 1986 she attempted suicide. People had been living a false life. Denial makes people strange “The older I get the more political I am about depression, or less essentialist – it is not because of who you are, but where you are placed,” she writes. “Ireland broke apart in the eighties, and I sometimes think that the crack happened in my own head. The constitutional row about abortion was a moral civil war that was fought out in people’s homes – including my own – with unfathomable bitterness. The country was screaming at itself about contraception, abortion, and divorce. It was a hideously misogynistic time. Not the best environment for a young woman establishing a sexual identity.” “My mother was very conservative, Catholic,” Enright says; “I was very oppositional, very strong in my own opinions.” Her parents had had four compliant children and didn’t know what to do with her, an overachiever in the wrong way, clever but maverick. “My mother was, or became, hard to please. That relationship didn’t thrive for a number of years until, reluctantly, she came to an accommodation. “Ireland was changing underneath but not on the surface. I wasn’t the only person who had difficulty in that generation. The stories were legion. People had been living a false life. Denial makes people strange.” Suicide is a sensitive topic, and we leave it there, but the author follows up the next day with an email that clarifies things further. “I wasn’t expecting to be asked about suicidal thoughts 40 years in my past, but I suppose I have always skirted around the difficult feelings of those years. I moved in with Martin after college and my mother took very poorly to our ‘living in sin’, so by the time I left for UEA I wasn’t speaking to my family, and then, for reasons that must have made sense at the time, I broke up with Martin too. I had the feeling I was embarking on my writer’s life completely alone, and when the writing did not come good, everything seemed to fall apart for me. That is the scoop, right there.” I wonder how this trauma fed into her writing, the early work experimenting with fragmentation, that falling-apart impulse. Her debut novel features Stephen, an angel who has died by suicide. The Gathering’s eponymous family reunion is triggered by the suicide of a sibling, Liam. A death wish hangs over her short story Night Swim. Difficult mother-child relationships are a recurring feature in her best work. The fault line in families is often generational as much as gendered. It is no wonder her writing is so charged as she captures this. “It’s great to be asked after a million years of no one asking,” she says. “The Gathering has a suicide in it, and I had written about suicide a few years prior to that. Journalists were not reading the same book I had written. The [Booker] prize skewed their idea of what they wanted to talk about. Nobody asked: that’s the exercise of taboo right there. We will talk about everything else and not even notice it. It’s like Poe’s purloined letter: it’s right there in plain view.” That said, “if I was writing The Gathering as a book about suicide, I would have done it differently. Your questions are more personal and my answers are more social: I talk about the environmental, social factors in my life at the time, in a way because the personal is too personal and also, in a way, not fully true, or not enough. You can become unhinged for any number of reasons. [ Honing the craft of the Irish Writers Centre: ‘It’s a great story to tell, as we are a nation of storytellers’Opens in new window ] “The novel, as a form, is really interested in causation. Liam’s sister Veronica looks for a cause in The Gathering and doesn’t find one, except for the fact that Liam very clearly has been abused as a child. But suicide is absolute, death is so absolute, there is no cause big enough to explain it. “After the Booker, some of the journalistic antagonism was so extreme I woke up 20 years later thinking that [abuse] must have happened to them. Though the book is not about the brother’s abuse so much as Veronica’s problem of witnessing it. All that is one of the slowest burns in Irish life. It is only two years since the Blackrock [College sex abuse] scandal surfaced.” Stephen in The Wig “owes a lot to gay Catholic iconography, Latinx gay culture. It’s more a queer reading.” Again, she follows up the next day: “Two things though. The post-suicide angel in The Wig owes something to the feeling that I was in a ‘second’, somehow magical life now. “I am not sure if the writerly impulse towards fragmentation maps absolutely onto the psychological, though I see how you might want to make the connection. Working with fragments is not so limited as linear fiction when it comes to capturing experience – it mimics the way consciousness works, so is a lot more like life. Joyce used fragments. I am fed up saying I have a problem with authority, and that is why I do not write realism. Naturalistic fiction is a lie – and a dull one at that. This is me changing the narrative from your ‘broken’ to my ‘honest’ or even ‘smart’.” Miraculously, despite everything that had happened and not happened in Norwich, Enright came home that summer and spent six weeks at the Tyrone Guthrie Centre, the artists’ retreat at Annaghmakerrig, in Co Monaghan, during which she wrote three stories, which were published in a Faber anthology (alongside Hugo Hamilton). Her mother sent her a clipping of an RTÉ ad: “Producer-director wanted”. She got an amazing reference from Malcolm Bradbury, and next thing she was a trainee director at Montrose, alongside Jim Sherwin and Moya Doherty. At a time in Ireland when most young people didn’t even have a job, she was directing live TV shows such as Nighthawks, making great television with the likes of Kevin McAleer and Arthur Riordan, but it was 85 shows a year with no holidays. It was high cortisone, living on her nerves, anarchic. It ended in a breakdown, “which I would now call a burnout”. “How much time and young energy and talent did I throw into that effing organisation,” she wrote. She quit and became a writer full-time. What sort of creative-writing tutor is she? “I feel we are moving towards the American consumer model of education, the idea that you’re going to get doled-out information that will teach you how to write. I feel that is an illusion; it makes the student satisfied with the service but not good on the page. I’m interested in reversing the polarity. I read the students’ work. They will be read, not taught, and be given line edits, as well as a broader response and editorial guidance. There is nowhere else you can get all of that in one place. “I tell them the structure of a sentence is the structure of the writer’s mind. I show them what they are doing on the page and how to see what the work is requiring of them. Getting a conversation going between the page and the artist. Writing as an act of discovery. I love a fresh text: it makes me recognise the provisionality of everything you are doing on the page, because we are all in the same boat, writing badly and then making it better and, finally, good.” Attention: Writing on Life, Art and the World, by Anne Enright, is published by Jonathan Cape on October 30th You can contact Samaritans on freephone 116 123 or by email at jo@samaritans.ie © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

As a player operating in multiple segments — IT office park, exhibition centre, events hosting, food & beverages — Nesco has delivered on multiple fronts and generated stellar gains in its financials in recent years. We had recommended a buy in the stock of Nesco at ₹888 in August 2024. The price has risen sharply over the past year or so. However, the company still remains an attractive bet on the exhibitions, commercial realty and hospitality spaces and is quite reasonably valued even at the current price. At 1,345, the stock trades at 19 times its likely per share earnings for FY26. Though not strictly comparable, most realty players and those focused on commercial real estate trade over 25 times forward earnings and the BSE Realty index trades at a PE of over 48 times. Most hotels trade at multiples in excess of 35 times. Investors can consider buying the Nesco stock even at the current levels with a three-year perspective, given the reasonably attractive valuations and robust traction in its key segments of operations. The company continues to be debt-free as it has remained for the past several years. In the three years from FY22 to FY25, Nesco’s revenue from operations rose at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.5 per cent to ₹732 crore in FY25, while net profits increased at 25.6 per cent over the same period to ₹375.2 crore. After a moderate FY25 (around 8 per cent topline growth year on year), the company’s revenues and net profits have bounced back in Q1FY26 with revenues and net profits increasing 36.8 per cent and 37.8 per cent, respectively in a YoY basis. A good part of the buoyancy is set to continue for the foreseeable future. A net profit margin in excess of 50 per cent is among the best in the industry. Nesco’s return on equity is healthy at 15.23 per cent in FY25. As mentioned earlier, Nesco operates in multiple segments. The company runs an IT park/commercial realty segment with long-term clients. Then there is the Bombay Exhibition Centre that hosts various events, trade fairs, conferences and concerts/shows of star music performers and the like. The foods division is another key segment spanning corporate catering and private parties, MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions), weddings and social events and outdoor catering. There is a minor engineering division (Indabrator). The Nesco IT Park main segment accounts for 50 per cent of the overall revenue of the company. It earns rentals and income from other value-added services rendered to commercial clients. The company’s realty segment has 17.5 lakh sq ft of chargeable area, with 25,000 employees working in the Nesco IT park across 25 clients. Occupants include the likes of HSBC, KPMG, PWC, MSCI, BlackRock, Here Solution, Framestore, Priceline, Ericsson, Apollo Global, ISS Governance, Sodexo and Ericsson. Despite being a tough year for IT and ITeS segments, clients from other industries made up for the slow traction, as the segment itself grew 15.1 per cent in FY25 over FY24. Even in Q1FY26, the segment has grown at a healthy double-digit space. Occupancies in a couple of its towers are nearing 100 per cent by the end of FY25. The next largest revenue segment is the Bombay Exhibition Centre (BEC: 27.4 per cent of revenues in FY25). IIJS Signature and IGJME 2025, National Garment Fair 2025, Acetech 2024, Automation Expo 2024 and HGH 2024 were some of the mega exhibitions hosted in 2025. With the ability to construct stalls based on varied customised requirements, the BEC is able to accommodate visitors on a large scale. There is an events sub-segment within the BEC that hosts live concerts, spiritual meetings and other shows. Also, as it operates in a prime location – Goregaon, it is able to receive significant traction for all events. BEC’s revenue growth bounced back in Q1FY26 with 67.6 per cent rise year on year after an indifferent FY25. Nesco foods is the third largest segment, accounting for 15.7 per cent of revenues in FY25. This segment grew at a healthy 16 per cent in FY25 over FY24. In Q1FY26, the segment’s revenues rose a strong 147.6 per cent. In FY25 alone, the division had 36 new brand partner registrations and tie-ups with 17 event management agencies. As many as 193 corporate clients and 150 weddings were hosted in FY25. According to a research report from Coherent Market Insights, the India meetings, conferences and exhibitions market, which is valued at $4.59 billion in 2025, would grow at a CAGR of 18 per cent from 2025-2032 and reach $14.62 billion by 2032. A reasonably-established player such as Nesco is thus well placed to tap into this growing market over the long term. Its smaller engineering division (6.9 per cent of revenues in FY25), Indabrator, focuses on manufacturing machinery, equipment and capital goods in the surface preparation and allied segments.

Title: New Trump Administration Energy Rule Would Enable Data Centers with ‘Large Loads’
URL: https://gizmodo.com/ai-large-loads-2000676957
Time Published: 2025-10-25T14:00:39Z
Full Content:
Reading time: Reading time 3 minutes Data centers are being built with unprecedented gusto all over the U.S. The reason for this is fairly well known: the AI business requires gargantuan amounts of electricity and computing power. Every time you use an app like DALL-E to, say, make one of those dumb AI-generated images of Mickey Mouse committing the 9/11 terrorist attacks, you’re apparently using as much energy as it takes to charge an iPhone. Now picture how much electricity is being used if millions of Americans do it at the same time. The Trump administration has made it known that it’s a friend to the AI industry (it recently launched the AI infrastructure initiative Stargate) and so, it makes perfect sense that its Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, has decided to cut the red tape when it comes to hooking data centers up to the electrical grid. In a statement published Friday, the Energy Department announced its plan to amend current rules to allow organizations that consume a lot of electricity to connect to the grid much faster: “U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today to initiate rulemaking procedures with a proposed rule to rapidly accelerate the interconnection of large loads, including data centers, positioning the United States to lead in AI innovation and in the revitalization of domestic manufacturing.” Hear that, guys? Chris Wright is apparently such a big fan of large loads that, in a bout of deregulatory fervor, he’s now helping to usher in a new era of easier data center connection. While the specifics of Wright’s proposed rule are a little bit complicated, the obvious takeaway seems to be an effort to make the regulatory process less onerous on people who want to hook up a lot of servers to the grid. The Register notes that one proposed rule is to “limit the time taken to review connection decisions to 60 days,” ostensibly so applicants don’t get bogged down in a lengthy review process. In a letter about the proposed rule change published to the government’s website, Wright wrote: “To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity. To do this, large loads, including AI data centers, served by public utilities must be able to connect to the transmission system in a timely, orderly, and non-discriminatory manner. This is an urgent issue that requires prompt attention.” He added: “This Administration is committed to revitalizing domestic manufacturing/ and driving American AI innovation.’ both of which will require unprecedented and extraordinary quantities of electricity and substantial investment in the Nation’s interstate transmission system. We must do so efficiently, fairly, and expeditiously.” The data center industry is booming, and, despite all that “bubble” talk when it comes to the AI business, it shows no signs of slowing down. Companies like Nebiusâwhich most of us had never heard of twelve months agoâare in the process of making themselves essential to large parts of the digital economy. Nebius, which is an AI infrastructure provider (it operates data centers), recently netted a deal with Microsoft, and went in on a robotaxi firm with Uber. Its stock price has also erupted some 350 percent this year, so, suffice to sayâfor the momentâit really pays to have a lot of servers.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 While insider buying is typically slower when markets are near all-time highs and when earnings-reporting season is in full swing, it never seems to dry up altogether. A few notable purchases in the past week or so attest to this. A beneficial owner took advantage of a public offer to increase a stake in a gold and silver miner, while another showed some love for a struggling offshore driller. The chief executives of a biotech also continued acquiring shares. Let’s take a quick look at these notable transactions in the past week or so. What does insider buying tell us? A well-known adage reminds us that corporate insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company because they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. Thus, insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors. This is all the more so during times of uncertainty in the markets, and even when markets are near all-time highs. With the third-quarter earnings-reporting season underway, many insiders are prohibited from buying or selling shares. Below are some of the most notable insider purchases that were reported recently, starting with the largest and most prominent. This transaction was part of a public offering of Hycroft Mining Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: HYMC) stock that raised approximately $150 million. The Nevada-based miner subsequently announced that it had extinguished all its remaining debt. The stock is almost 88% higher than 90 days ago and was last seen trading almost a dollar per share higher than the buyer’s purchase price. The share price is up 167.6% year over year. The stock has little analyst coverage and no Buy ratings. Yet, the consensus price target is up at $13.61. Note that this Canadian billionaire previously purchased $62 million worth of the shares this summer. Sable Offshore Corp. (NYSE: SOC) stock recently sank to a 52-week low below $12 as the Houston-based company faces multiple legal and regulatory issues. Shares were last seen trading well below the purchase price range above. The offshore oil and gas field operations provider has a mean price target of $39.20, which would be a gain of 207.9% in the next 12 months. All five analysts who cover the stock recommend buying shares. Roth Capital recently reiterated its Buy rating. Note that this buyer’s stake is up to more than 10.9 million shares. Also note that about 24% of all shares are held short. These transactions were part of a private placement. Summit Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: SMMT) posted a wider-than-expected loss for the third quarter, and the stock has retreated 8.1% in the past week. The Miami-based biopharmaceutical company also recently announced the expansion of Phase 3 trials of its colorectal cancer treatment. Despite recent declines, the stock is still up 8.2% year to date and trading for more than the purchase price above. The $31.80 mean price target is less than the $36.91 52-week high, but that target represents a gain of 60.0% in the coming year. Analysts on average recommend buying shares. Co-CEOs Bob Duggan and Maky Zanganeh also purchased shares last month. catnap72 / Getty Images These were not the only notable insider purchases of the past week or so. Here’s a quick look at some others. Recently, some smaller insider buying was reported at Commercial Metals, Denny’s, Fastenal, Fifth Third Bancorp, Heico, Synovus Financial, Toll Brothers, and Uber, as well.

Title: Miami’s outgoing mayor warns about what he sees happening in New York and the 2 cities’ different approaches to next summer’s World Cup
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/25/francis-suarez-miami-mayor-interview-zohran-mamdani-world-cup-trump-billionaires/
Time Published: 2025-10-25T13:05:00Z
Full Content:
Nick Lichtenberg is business editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. Francis Suarez is proud that an adopted Miamian, FIFA chief Gianni Infantino, will be speaking at the upcoming America Business Forum—as will Infantino’s new chum, President Donald Trump. Suarez, who briefly ran a Republican presidential campaign in 2023, hailed Trump in comments to Fortune, calling the president “one of the most consequential political and business leaders of our time,” adding that his perspective on leadership, global business, and America’s role in the world “will be a defining part of this year’s Forum. We are honored to welcome him to Miami.” Suarez also told Fortune that he’s proud Miami is hosting the second-most World Cup games next summer, including the bronze medal game. After nearly eight years in office, the outgoing mayor is proud of realizing his ambitions to make Miami the “capital of capital,” arguing in an interview with Fortune that it’s “graduated from the capital of Latin America to a truly great global city.” And Suarez has a lot of words for the likely next mayor of New York, Zohran Mamdani, including Mamdani’s campaign to force FIFA to change its ticket pricing strategy. “This is sort of government overreach, right?” Suarez said. While offering a significant caveat, noting he is not overly familiar with the specifics of Mamdani’s campaign, which accuses FIFA of “price gouging” and urges it to set aside 15% of tickets at discounted rates for working-class New Yorkers, Suarez pivoted to discussion of housing policy. “You see this in the context of rent controls or price controls,” he said, the first of many broadsides he aimed at what he sees happening in New York City politics. “They seem good in the short run, like it makes you feel good, right? Like, hey, we’re going to control prices.” For his part, Mamdani has framed the issue as one area where government should try to intervene. “Are any working-class New Yorkers actually going to be able to watch any of the matches?” he has asked publicly, accusing FIFA of “pricing working people out of the game that they love” and urging other cities to join his battle against what he described as unchecked greed, as seen in the title of his campaign, “Game over Greed.” ​Mamdani claims FIFA’s dynamic pricing model amounts to “price gouging” as tickets for the 2026 FIFA World Cup—hosted across 16 cities, with eight matches and the final at MetLife Stadium—will range from $60 up to $6,730, with prices adjusting to demand. In his petition, Mamdani called for caps on resale prices similar to regulations recently adopted in fellow host country Mexico, situating the fight within a broader movement to protect working people from rising costs. ​Mamdani’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment from Fortune. But JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon sat down with Fortune earlier in October at the Most Powerful Women summit in Washington DC, and offered some thoughts on how the business class is regarding Mamdani, weeks out of the mayoral election. Dimon said that if Mamdani is elected, he will offer his help. Calling Mamdani’s Democratic Socialist movement “literally more Marxist than socialist,” Dimon alluded to reports of conversations between the two men and Mamdani’s widely reported charm offensive with New York’s business class. Mamdani is “talking to a lot of people, he’s convinced a lot of people [that] he’s going to change [and] he wants to learn.” As for Suarez, the popular two-term Republican mayor has long insisted on government being open for business and small in scope. “When government intervenes,” Suarez told Fortune, “oftentimes the result is catastrophe, it’s chaos.” He said he sees Miami, on the other hand, as “a city where a rising tide lifts all boats,” noting its exceptionally low unemployment (2.9% as of August) and high median wage growth (Asana found it was the highest in the nation from 2020 to 2023, outpacing inflation). Suarez told Fortune he thinks he’s been a successful mayor because of deliberate policy choices that focused government on narrow quality-of-life issues, a business-friendly attitude, and striking while the iron was hot. He reminded Fortune that it all started with a viral tweet back in December 2020, when he took the idea of transforming South Beach into Silicon Valley seriously. It was far behind his goal coming in, when he merely wanted to help Miami transition away from an industrial economy. That tweet helped him realize, he said, “that there was an inflection point that would allow us to hyperscale.” He said he was an opportunity to squeeze 30 years’ worth of growth into just three or four, and that he’d be proud to be remembered as a social-media mayor. Suarez said he was wary of Mamdani. “My parents came from a country [in Cuba] where a young, charismatic leader made the same promises. And he did create equality: He created equality of misery, suffering, poverty.” Still, Suarez and Mamdani have some things in common, especially their telegenic, social-media savvy rises to fame, albeit from opposing political poles. When this dynamic is pointed out, especially the central role of social media in their campaigning, Suarez says he “thinks that’s true,” while quickly clarifying that “anybody who’s young, presumably, is going to be good on social media, right?” Suarez would rather talk about what he sees Mamdani ultimately selling to likely voters: “Are you selling a future that’s going to make things better, or are you selling a road to perdition? And I think he’s selling a road to perdition, whether he’s doing it intentionally or not, whether he actually believes that he can make things better. I have no idea. I don’t know him personally.” Suarez is eager to reel off the top names he’s recruited to Miami, whether it’s billionaires, celebrities, or major employers. He notes that besides Infantino, the city has attracted Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Hall of Fame quarterback Tom Brady, soccer superstar Lionel Messi, and hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin. “These are people that could live anywhere in the world and have chosen to live in Miami.” Suarez notes that he’s an anomaly as the first native-born Miami mayor, and Miami is known for being made up of adopted Miamians. The mayor also listed Miami’s leading lights in business, with firms such as BlackRock, Blackstone, and Citadel all opening local offices or even headquarters locally. “We’ve attracted companies that manage close to $13 trillion in assets,” he said, and it’s adding notable conferences along with attractions like Formula One and the new Inter Miami soccer stadium. This has all put stress on Miami’s infrastructure, Suarez acknowledged, saying Miami is in some ways a victim of its goal to become “Wall Street South.” He said there’s “definitely a gentrification happening in Miami,” and it has gotten expensive. In fact, UBS Global Wealth Management’s annual Real Estate Bubble Index, published in late September, put Miami at the very top spot of its global “bubble risk index,” backing Suarez’s argument that it is truly a global city after explosive growth under his tenure. The nearest American cities to Miami on UBS’ list were Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York, respectively. The Swiss bank noted that Miami’s bubble risk had actually decreased since 2024 and over the past five years, Miami and the similarly sunny and wealthy Dubai have led the pack, averaging real price growth of roughly 50%. Among all the bubbly real-estate markets, UBS found Miami posting the strongest inflation-adjusted housing appreciation over the past 15 years. Affordability is still near record lows, but housing inventory has rebounded to near pre-pandemic levels as of 2025. “Miami’s coastal appeal and favorable tax environment continue to attract newcomers from the U.S. West and Northeast,” the report noted, with international demand remaining robust, particularly from Latin America. Suarez blames too many New Yorkers moving in for the inflated real-estate prices. “When people come in, it does put stress on our price affordability. We used to be a lot more affordable than New York, until all the New Yorkers came and now we’re close in price.” He said he sees this continuing under the likely mayorship of Mamdani. “The sense that I have … as interest rates go down, plus people fleeing New York, there will be another wave. You feel it, you sense it, it’s going to have a 20%, 30% impact on values.” Suburban New York realtors say they are seeing a “Mamdani effect” of more moderate and conservative New Yorkers fleeing ahead of Mamdani’s election, with home sales in contract spiking 15% year-over-year per one local firm. Within the city, Alexander Carter, a licensed real-estate salesperson with the Corcoran Group, previously told Fortune that she had “never seen this type of reaction to a mayor,” having worked in real estate for three or four different tenures. “It’s been pretty drastic. After he won the primary we had a companywide call on implications for business because of the ‘rent freezes.’” She said the Mamdani effect comes down to one thing: “People are afraid it will be bad for business.” Suarez insists that he doesn’t want Miami to succeed while New York is failing. “I think you want every great American city to succeed.” New York City, by the way, is the only metro area that will host more World Cup games than Miami—all of them across the river, in nearby New Jersey. Although, President Trump has recently hinted that he’ll seek to strip World Cup games from cities that he doesn’t like. Miami surely wouldn’t be one of those. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: What went wrong in the Heather Humphreys campaign

Time Published: 2025-10-25T10:29:41Z
Full Content:
Heather Humphreys is standing in the paddock of a farm in Slane, Co Meath, recalling a visit “to a lovely restaurant in Singapore to promote Irish duck”. “The best duck in the world, in my view,” Humphreys tells a handful of bored reporters. Over her shoulder, in the field behind her, one amorous bovine mounts another. A rabble of Fine Gael farmers stand with Heather stickers on their lapels, ready to clap. It feels like a Fine Gael event rather than a campaign one. Among supporters such as these, no votes will be lost, but no votes will be won either. Elsewhere, a presidential campaign for the remaining 80 per cent of the electorate is taking place. In the mire of its 1990 presidential election, where Fine Gael came last of three candidates including a Fianna Fáil tánaiste who was sacked mid-campaign, some in the party decried a campaign that sent Austin Currie out to “shake hands with Ireland”. This time around, the Humphreys campaign against Independent rival Catherine Connolly seemed to focus on sending her out to shake hands with the roughly 20 per cent of Ireland that already votes for Fine Gael. [ Follow our Presidential election live blog: Connolly on course for landslide win; huge number of spoiled votesOpens in new window ] This narrow focus cost the party dearly as Connolly romped to victory over Humphreys. During the campaign, there were entire days when reporters following Humphreys wouldn’t see her encounter a single undecided voter. At what felt more like Fine Gael events than general campaign events, Humphreys would meet people who had decided long ago they were voting for her and were wearing the campaign stickers to prove it. The campaign rarely gravitated far from the comfortable terrain of events of Tidy Towns and credit unions. Spontaneous encounters with the electorate became rare. In a breakneck walkabout of Grafton Street in Dublin, the Humphreys campaign took the busy thoroughfare at a canter – effectively meeting no voters at all before retreating into Bewley’s cafe, where supporters waited. On the very last day of the campaign, watching Humphreys charm a delighted crowd of 500 at the Irish Country Living women and agriculture conference in Sligo, her team started to regret that the public still had not seen “the real Heather”. Even before polls had closed, Fine Gael argued Humphreys had been plunged into the bruising election at late notice. But revisionists of the very recent past omit to mention that Humphreys was swept into the race on the crest of an organic wave of support from TDs. Many within the party were so convinced of her broad appeal, they thought they had a better candidate than Mairead McGuinness, the party’s original candidate, who dropped out of the race due to ill-health. On the windy prom in the middle class area of Blackrock, Co Louth on October 1st, former Fianna Fáil TD Declan Breathnach happened to show up to endorse Humphreys in front of the media. Humphreys’s cross-party appeal in the Border counties was never in question. What will be scrutinised now is if it was ever developed beyond. In 1944, the American journalist Franklin P Adams wrote that elections are won “chiefly because most people vote against somebody rather than for somebody”. By the final week of the campaign, a pessimism had calcified within the Fine Gael parliamentary party that this presidential election had become a referendum on the Government and so Humphreys’s candidacy as a former minister was doomed. A minority within the party say their impression was more “genuine disinterest” from the public. Fine Gael’s ground war spent a lot of time trying to make a virtue of Humphreys’s tenure at the cabinet table, with the campaign mapped around projects Humphreys had supported. The internal schedule used by the campaign team often had a note beside each location of how much government funding the venue had received under Humphreys’s tenure as minister for community development. Fine Gael tried to ensure that the proverbial eaten bread was not forgotten. As Connolly’s lead grew, so did Fine Gael’s frustration with the coverage of their “Teflon” rival. “If Heather had been repossessing houses and meeting warlords, we would have had to pull out of the campaign,” one source said. Humphreys’s own media performances could be ropey. She was not prepared for questions about her husband’s former membership of the Orange Order and was hurt by them. Some in Fine Gael feel that there was an immaturity whereby some people failed to grasp that it would have been unusual for a Monaghan Presbyterian family at the time not to have some links with the Orange Order. The presidential campaign was said to be the first time Humphreys had real experience of social media abuse. There were a couple of occasions when it really got to her, according to campaign aides. On the margins of the RTÉ Prime Time debate, the last of the campaign, an adviser sighed in despair: “The same questions again.” Entire days on the campaign trail had been written off by the demands of media debates and interviews. Everyone in the campaign accepted that when the camera was on, their candidate’s personality was off. Her uncertainty fared poorly when compared with Connolly’s assured performances. Senior Fine Gael figures blame the departure of Fianna Fáil’s candidate Jim Gavin for sealing their defeat, and denying Humphreys transfers. Allies are deeply disappointed with Fianna Fáilers who couldn’t countenance supporting her even when their own candidate wasn’t running. Within the Humphreys campaign some called these diehard party members “Black Fianna Fáilers”. With some exceptions, Fine Gael felt its Coalition colleagues were lethargic in their opposition to Connolly. As polling day drew nearer, Fine Gael TDs were fielding more and more complaints from supporters who wanted to know “why our posters aren’t as good”. By Friday, Fine Gael was stressing that Connolly had enjoyed the financial backing of Sinn Féin, “the richest party in the State”. It was only in the final week that Fine Gael started to truly appreciate that its one party press office was competing against the five party press offices supporting Connolly. One night in the second last week of the campaign, a gloom descended on the campaign. Details of The Irish Times/Ipsos B&A opinion poll the following morning had started to leak: Connolly was close to lapping Humphreys at 38 per cent to 20 per cent, the poll showed. Febrile panic was followed by cold certainty: Fine Gael had to arrest Connolly’s momentum. And so came one of the defining moments of the campaign, when a now infamous attack video was released that accused the left-wing candidate of hypocrisy for her role acting as a barrister for banks in repossession cases. [ The three viral moments that swung the election campaign for Catherine ConnollyOpens in new window ] Senior Fine Gael figures outside of the core campaign were somewhat mystified by the decision to focus on repossessions rather than compiling a video of things Connolly has said about the European Union. The video was accompanied by a front-page story in the Sunday Independent, where Humphreys implied that Connolly had made money “out of people’s misfortune”. It didn’t work. And it pushed Humphreys into even more uncomfortable terrain. In the last week of the campaign, what should have been a strong press conference surrounded by independent supporters such as Independents Michael Healy-Rae and Marian Harkin became one of Humphreys’s worst. Asked about her comments just days previously, she tried to resile from them: “No, I did not say that. I did not say that ... no, please, I did not say that.” This weekend, Fine Gael consoled itself by comparing this outcome with the nadir of its presidential elections: the 6.4 per cent result for Gay Mitchell in the 2011 presidential election. Some of Humphreys’s team were emotional on Friday, from the bittersweet cocktail of pride and disappointment. Most people emerge from presidential campaigns destroyed. Her allies at least feel that Humphreys has lost with grace. “She can leave it with her head held high,” one friend said. Our politics team's behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

Title: The 5 unbelievable crypto comeback stories that changed the world forever
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/the-5-greatest-comeback-stories-in-crypto-that-changed-the-world-forever/
Time Published: 2025-10-25T10:05:54Z

Are these the definitive crypto comebacks? Plus some of the most notable failures. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Crypto is nothing if not cyclical. Every cycle births icons, wrecks them, and sometimes resurrects them. What was once written off as dead can roar back to life with a vengeance, reshaped by regulation, technology, or sheer market gravity. From courtrooms to codebases, from bankrupt exchanges to blockchains that refused to quit, the industry’s best comeback stories reveal something deeper than price action, they show crypto’s strange, relentless capacity to rebuild itself. These are the five most extraordinary revivals in crypto history, plus a few spectacular failures that never made it back. The fall. After 2017’s mania, XRP became a regulatory pariah. Major U.S. exchanges delisted it as the SEC’s lawsuit dragged through years of uncertainty, crushing liquidity and sentiment. The turn. Judge Analisa Torres’ July 2023 ruling that programmatic XRP sales weren’t securities reopened the U.S. market. Coinbase, Kraken, and others relisted the token, while 2025 brought closure, final civil penalties and no meaningful appeal path left. The legal fog that defined XRP’s lost years finally lifted. Where it stands today. XRP trades around $2.40 and ranks #5 by market cap, rejoining the upper echelon of crypto assets after half a decade in exile. The comeback isn’t just about price; it’s about legitimacy regained. Forward outlook. What to watch: XRPL volumes vs. stablecoin settlement growth, upcoming ETP approvals in the U.S. or EU, and on-exchange depth and basis spreads versus ETH and SOL. A courtroom comeback matured into a market-cap comeback. XRP is a top-five coin again, this time anchored less by hype than by the vacuum left as regulators inch toward rules for tokenized payments. The fall. In November 2023, Binance’s years-long regulatory standoff climaxed in a $4.3 billion settlement with the DOJ, FinCEN, OFAC, and CFTC. Founder Changpeng Zhao pled guilty to a single BSA violation and resigned, closing one of the most consequential enforcement cases in crypto history. The turn. Two optics shifts defined 2025. First, Binance proved structurally resilient, after ceding BTC-futures volume leadership to CME in 2024, it regained market share across spot and derivatives through mid-2025. Second, Trump’s October 2025 pardon of CZ softened the exchange’s U.S. stigma, hinting at eventual regulatory thawing even as licensing remains complex. Where it stands today. BNB broke through $1,000 on September 18, 2025, setting a new all-time high and delivering a clean, visual narrative of redemption, from legal nadir to renewed dominance. Forward outlook. What to watch: Kaiko market-share data, monitor wind-down timelines, court filings on U.S. operations, and quarterly BNB burns. Regulatory winter melted into political spring, the coin of crypto’s most embattled exchange just printed four digits. The fall. In 2021–22, Solana went from darling to damaged. Outages, congestion, and the FTX collapse left its reputation in tatters. “Ethereum killer” became a punchline as downtime and venture overexposure crushed sentiment. The turn. Fast forward to 2024–25: uptime has gone spotless, and usage has gone parabolic. The network has logged 100% reliability over the past 60 days, with multi-month streaks signaling true technical maturity. Memecoins turned Solana into the epicenter of retail speculation, while tokenized assets (Backed’s equities, Ondo’s USDY) signaled a new institutional chapter. The same chain that once crashed under load now clears billions in daily volume without breaking stride. Where it stands today. Solana’s DEX volume has regularly matched or topped Ethereum’s throughout 2025, with memecoin bursts acting as its native volatility engine. SOL trades near multi-year highs, backed by liquidity depth and a visibly sticky developer base. Forward outlook. What to watch: status.solana.com uptime metrics, Firedancer mainnet progress, RWA TVL and issuance, DEX share versus ETH/Base, and total stablecoin float on Solana. First came the memes; now come the treasuries. Solana’s comeback is morphing from speculative to structural. The fall. The 2016 DAO hack fractured Ethereum into ETH and ETC, a philosophical schism that could have killed the project. The turn. The Merge in September 2022 cemented Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake. Dencun and EIP-4844 brought cheap data availability for rollups, unlocking explosive L2 growth. Then came the 2024–25 wave of U.S. spot ETH ETF approvals, pulling the asset into the same regulated orbit as Bitcoin. By 2025, Layer 2 adoption had become the backbone of daily Ethereum usage. Where it stands today. ETH reclaimed the $4,000 level in 2025, with L2s processing roughly 80–90% of ecosystem transactions. Ethereum now operates more as a global settlement and data layer than a single execution environment. Forward outlook. What to watch: ETH ETF flow dashboards (Farside, CoinShares), L2Beat throughput and TVL, blob fees post-4844, and net staking flows. From a chain that once rewrote history to survive, Ethereum now writes it, inside brokerage accounts and atop a sprawling L2 economy. The fall. 2018’s “crypto winter” and the 2020 COVID crash minted literal obituary headlines. Bitcoin was written off as a speculative relic, the bubble that burst twice. Retail volumes vanished, miners capitulated, and mainstream finance moved on. By late 2020, “Bitcoin is dead” had been declared more than 400 times. Yet beneath the despair, hash rate resilience and global developer persistence quietly kept the chain alive. The turn. After the 2020 halving a speculation filled COVID bubble late in the year and into 2021 saw Bitcoin smash previous all-time highs and reach $69,000. However, the subsequent bear market, made worse by systemic crash fueled by the fall of FTX saw Bitcoin fall below $15,000 once more and obituaries returned. Down but not out, the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in January 2024 rewrote the narrative from fringe speculation to formal asset class. What began as a decade-long lobbying effort by Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity culminated in the single biggest bridge ever built between crypto and traditional finance. Within weeks, billions flowed into the new ETFs; by mid-2025, BTC had joined the likes of gold and the S&P 500 in brokerage model portfolios. The macro environment, rate cuts, de-dollarization chatter, and renewed safe-haven demand, did the rest. BTC pierced $100,000 in December 2024 and notched a fresh all-time high near $126,000 in October 2025 as ETF inflows re-accelerated. CME’s open-interest share in Bitcoin futures topped 55%, marking Wall Street’s full arrival. On-chain, long-term holder supply hit record highs even as ETF issuers led by BlackRock accumulated spot reserves. Where it stands today. Bitcoin now trades less like a frontier asset and more like macro collateral. It sits in pension fund allocations, Treasury portfolios, and ETF baskets, governed by audited custodians and daily flow data. The 2024 halving reinforced supply discipline, while ETF creations institutionalized demand. Even skeptics now reference Bitcoin’s implied yield, futures basis, and ETF premium as if it were a fixed-income instrument. Forward outlook. What to watch: Daily ETF flow dashboards, CME vs. offshore perpetuals basis spreads, aggregate stablecoin market cap as a proxy for global liquidity, and realized volatility versus Nasdaq beta. Bitcoin’s return marked the moment the world’s first decentralized alternative to fiat became impossible to contain. Once dismissed as a fringe experiment, it has now infiltrated Wall Street as a Trojan horse for monetary sovereignty: regulated, measurable, and yet utterly beyond control. With over $2 trillion in value and adoption stretching from retail wallets to pension funds, Bitcoin remains as the only true ‘freedom money.’ While seemingly ‘innocent’ compared to the rest of the failures on this list, STEPN’s fall from grace was meteoric. At one point it seemed that move-to-earn was going to reshape the entire crypto ecosystem with an amazing new use case for NFTs. Users and revenue surged in early 2022 as STEPN’s move-to-earn model went viral, with daily active users topping 700,000 and SOL network fees spiking from in-app minting and trades. At its peak, Genesis sneakers sold for thousands of dollars and the project’s GMT token rallied nearly 30x from launch. But within months, D30 retention cratered as anti-bot updates, GST inflation, and regional bans hit engagement. By late 2022, DAU and revenue had collapsed more than 90% from their highs, sneaker minting froze, and marketplace activity dwindled. Marketed from 2014 to 2017 as a revolutionary digital currency, OneCoin raised over $4 billion from investors worldwide despite lacking any blockchain. Founder Ruja Ignatova, later dubbed the “Cryptoqueen,” vanished in 2017 after global authorities began investigating the scheme. Co-founder Karl Sebastian Greenwood was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Ignatova remains on the FBI’s Most Wanted list. OneCoin’s collapse became a cautionary tale of unchecked hype, opaque operations, and the dangers of centralized “crypto” without cryptography. Once handling over 70% of Bitcoin trades, Mt. Gox’s 2014 collapse became crypto’s first major catastrophe, losing 850,000 BTC and destroying public trust. After years of bankruptcy proceedings and creditor battles, 2024 finally saw repayments begin in Bitcoin and fiat. The case’s slow resolution marked a milestone in crypto’s legal maturation, with recovered assets exceeding expectations and signaling that even the industry’s darkest chapter could find partial redemption. The hedge fund’s 2022 implosion wiped out billions in counterparty exposure, triggering cascading liquidations across Celsius, Voyager, and Genesis. Founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu resurfaced with OPNX in 2023, an exchange centered on claims trading, but it launched under regulatory headwinds and low volumes. Dubai VARA fined the team in May 2023, Singapore’s MAS issued prohibition orders that September, and activity remained thin through 2024 and into 2025 versus peers. Attempts to add derivatives and new listings failed to regain share, with enforcement actions and a punctured trust loop defining the platform’s shallow depth. UST lost its dollar peg in May 2022, triggering a rapid unwinding as Anchor withdrawals surged and LUNA’s supply hyperinflated. The ecosystem’s value evaporated within weeks, and Terra 2.0 with LUNC attempted to reboot without an algorithmic stablecoin. The revival failed to regain traction, with most Terra projects either shutting down or migrating to Cosmos and other chains. Once the epicenter of crypto’s most devastating fraud, FTX’s 2022 implosion vaporized tens of billions in customer assets and shattered institutional confidence. Yet by 2024, bankruptcy administrators had liquidated vast holdings, recouping nearly all verified creditor claims, an outcome few deemed possible. While the exchange itself remains defunct, its asset recovery and the criminal accountability of key figures marked an unprecedented legal turnaround, showing crypto’s capacity for both catastrophic failure and structured restitution. Banking rails broke in 2022, then INR deposits restarted in 2024 with a new partner and FIU registration. Spot volumes, INR-pair depth, and on-ramp uptime improved through 2024 with maker rebates on INR-USDT. The path to a full comeback requires deeper INR books and durable bank connectivity over multiple quarters. The venue opened in late 2023, delivered a SOC 2 Type I in January 2024, launched BTC and ETH perpetuals under a Bermuda license in April, and shipped live proof-of-reserves in June. Spot and perp volumes climbed while spreads tightened, and the status page recorded no sev-1 incidents. The upgrade trigger is sustained depth within a top-tier cohort, plus enacted licenses in larger jurisdictions. Tokenized treasuries and real-estate issuance grew from early 2024 into early 2025 with custody attestations and regulator touchpoints, while secondary volumes formed on the project’s venues. A true comeback would hinge on redemption depth across market stress and a broader licensing footprint. After a 2024 audit and a privacy impact filing, integrations with wallets, exchanges, and dapps increased, attestations climbed, and version 2 added revocation and recovery in February 2025. The remaining watch items are privacy governance and attester decentralization. BIO added revocation and recovery to its attestations in February 2025 and ended the quarter with more than 1.8 million cumulative proofs issued. When the dust settles, the market does not clap, it checks. Courts file their orders, clients sync, miners tighten costs, market makers quote the inside, and the tape prints. The names that made it back are the ones that took the hit, changed the machinery, and kept clearing. The story ends where it always does here, with depth on the screen and blocks in the chain.

Title: Wall Street Is Worried About an AI Bubble—Here's the Sector Where Stock Prices Really Stand Out

AI boom or AI bubble? That's been one of the most pressing debates on Wall Street of late. Some investors see echoes of the Dotcom Bubble in Nvidia's (NVDA) and OpenAI's recent circular dealmaking bonanza and soaring stock prices. Others note the AI boom is being financed by hugely profitable tech companies, whose valuations aren't nearly as high as their Dotcom peers. As Big Tech's AI spending has ballooned, so have the ranks of companies claiming a piece of the pie. The AI buildout has turbocharged the sales of unsexy, slow-and-steady businesses and transformed their stocks into buzzy growth names. It has also juiced the stocks of nascent companies that are years from self-sufficiency, creating pockets of exceptional froth within a pricey AI ecosystem. The stocks that gain the most during sharp market rallies are often the stocks that, when sentiment turns negative, have the farthest to fall. That is especially true of young companies that, without substantial sales, rely on debt and equity markets to fund their growth. To understand where the AI trade has become most bubbly, Investopedia identified 75 companies regularly referred to as "AI beneficiaries" by Wall Street analysts, and sorted each into one of five categories: cloud computing providers; semiconductor makers; software companies; power providers; and networking, storage, and cooling equipment makers. A few companies, like Microsoft (MSFT), fit in multiple categories, in which case we've placed them in the one that feels most central to their AI business today. At present, Microsoft's cloud revenue is the best metric for assessing its AI business, so it's classified as a cloud provider instead of a software company. All five categories have seen their valuations rise over the past few years, but none more than power providers. The median price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of our power basket in 2025 is 4.53, nearly three times the median in 2023 (1.52). The next largest P/S expansions over that period were in networking, storage and cooling (4.45 in 2025 vs. 2.09 in 2023) and cloud providers (10.5 vs 6.34). (Cloud providers have a higher P/S ratio in absolute terms because the category is composed of tech stocks that have historically commanded higher valuations. This is why we've compared change over the past three years rather than absolute P/S ratios.) Power also has more unprofitable companies than any other category—so many in fact that we’re using price-to-sales as our benchmark valuation metric rather than the more common price-to-earnings ratio. Five of the 14 companies in our power basket are expected to report a loss this calendar year. No other category has more than one unprofitable company. The race to build the data centers that train and run AI models has set off an equally frenzied race to generate and transmit the vast amounts of electricity those data centers consume. Nuclear energy has attracted interest from tech companies for its efficiency and small carbon footprint. Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta (META) have all signed multi-billion dollar deals with nuclear power plant operators like Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG) and Vistra (VST), both of which have seen their stocks surge over the past two years. But in their rush to bring reliable sources of electricity online, tech companies and investors have also thrown money at nuclear tech upstarts, some without operational generators or regulatory approvals. Shares of small modular reactor maker NuScale Power (SMR) doubled in value between January and mid-October. At the stock’s peak earlier this month, the company, which reported $37 million in revenue last year and isn’t expected to be profitable until 2029, was valued at more than $15 billion. Meanwhile, nuclear tech startup Oklo’s (OKLO) market capitalization peaked at $25.7 billion earlier this month, a 720% increase from the start of the year. Oklo is the only company of the 75 we’ve included in our analysis that is expected to report no revenue this year. Analysts forecast it will turn a profit for the first time in 2030. Though it’s not just nuclear businesses that have achieved rich valuations. Fermi (FRMI), the developer of a massive AI data center campus in the Texas Panhandle, was founded in January and went public in early October at a valuation of more than $19 billion. Fermi plans to build 11 gigawatts of computing capacity powered by on-site nuclear, natural gas, wind, and solar generators. It expects to break ground on its first data center in March, and hopes to have about 1 GW of capacity online by the end of 2026. AI power stocks just finished a volatile week that may underscore the extent to which their prices are driven by fickle sentiment. Constellation Energy and Vistra both shed more than 10% of their value in the first half of the week, as did GE Vernova (GEV), whose turbines are in high demand from data center clients seeking to draw on the South’s ample supply of natural gas. All three finished the week little changed. The upstarts were hit even harder. NuScale, Oklo, and Fermi all lost more than 25% of their value between Monday's open and midday Wednesday. But they too rebounded, finishing the week with losses in the low- to mid-teens.

Belgium blocked consensus on using frozen Russian assets (â¬140 billion/$163 billion) as collateral for Ukraine, demanding stronger legal safeguards. Belgian PM Bart De Wever threatened legal and political resistance unless conditions were met, forcing a watered-down compromise. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that delays weaken Ukraine's defenses and slow EU progress. Kyiv pledged to spend funds on European weapons and air defenses, but EU leaders postponed final approval until December. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called any seizure "theft" and vowed legal retaliation. Russia has already seized Euroclearâs assets in response to sanctions and may escalate if the EU moves forward. Experts warn Russia could sue Euroclear in international courts, destabilizing Western finance. If Russia reclaims assets, the U.S. may default on Ukraine-related loans, accelerating dollar decline. The EU's hesitation exposes risks of weaponizing finance, with potential global financial upheaval. Ukraine's financial crisis worsens, with $20 billion in suspended debt payments and no clear funding solution.

The EU's hesitation exposes risks of weaponizing finance, with potential global financial upheaval. Ukraine's financial crisis worsens, with $20 billion in suspended debt payments and no clear funding solution. European Union (EU) leaders have delayed plans to use frozen Russian assets to finance a massive â¬140 billion ($163 billion) loan for Ukraine after Belgium demanded stronger legal safeguards, throwing negotiations into disarray. The move comes as Russia warns of severe financial and legal repercussions if the West proceeds with what Moscow calls outright "theft." At a Brussels summit on Thursday, Oct. 23, EU officials failed to reach an agreement on whether to use immobilized Russian central bank funds as collateral for Ukraine's war effort. Belgium, which holds legal control over the bulk of the frozen assets through Brussels-based Euroclear, insisted that all EU members share responsibility if the plan backfires. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever took a firm stance, stating:Â "If demands are met, we can go forward. If not, I will do everything in my power at the European level, also at the national level, politically and legally to stop this decision."Â His opposition forced a compromise text that merelyÂ "invites the [EU] Commission to present, as soon as possible, options for financial support,"Â rather than committing to the loan outright. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, attending the summit as a guest, urged immediate approval of the loan, warning that delays would weaken Ukraine's defenses. "Anyone who delays the decision on the full use of frozen Russian assets is not only limiting our defense, but also slowing down the EU's own progress,"Â he said. Kyiv pledged to use much of the funds to purchase European weapons and bolster air defenses. However, EU leaders, wary of legal blowback, postponed a final decision until December. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the complexity, stating:Â "This is a topic that is certainly not trivial. It's very complex." Russia warns of financial and legal repercussions Moscow has repeatedly condemned the West's efforts to repurpose Russian funds, calling it illegal confiscation. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that any seizure wouldÂ "boomerang"Â on the EU, adding:Â "If someone wants to steal our property, our assets, and illegally appropriate them... they will be subjected to legal prosecution one way or another." Russian Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev reinforced this stance, stating that Moscow has no plans to retaliate against European assetsâunless the EU moves first. "We are not confiscating anything yet. The Europeans haven't called for confiscation, so we won't confiscate anything until they do. If they do end up confiscating, then we will consider it,"Â he said. According to the Enoch AI engine at BrightU.AI,Â Russia's stance on the EU's plan to seize frozen Russian assets is one of strong opposition and condemnation, viewing it as a brazen act of theft and a violation of international law. Russia's stance is clear and resolute: it views the move as a violation of international law and a hostile act that it will not tolerate. Russia has taken countermeasures and threatened further action to protect its assets and economy. Legal experts warn that Russia could sue Euroclear in international courts, potentially reclaiming seized assets and destabilizing Western finance. Financial analyst Jim Rickards has cautioned that such a scenario could trigger a crisis, exposing the West'sÂ "theft scheme"Â and leaving financial institutions scrambling. Broader implications: A financial and geopolitical quagmire The stalled EU plan underscores deeper concerns about Ukraine's financial viability. Reports indicate Kyiv is already on the brink of default, withÂ 20 billion in suspended debt payments to investors like BlackRock. Meanwhile, the U.S. faces its own dilemmaâif Russia successfully reclaims frozen assets, Washington may default on obligations tied to Ukraine's 50 billion loan, accelerating the dollar's decline. As the EU scrambles for a legally defensible solution, the standoff highlights the growing risks of weaponizing finance in geopolitical conflicts. With no clear resolution in sight, the fate of Ukraine's fundingâand the stability of Western financial systemsâhangs in the balance. The EU's hesitation reveals a stark reality: The West's financial warfare against Russia may carry unforeseen consequences. As legal doubts mount and Moscow prepares its counterstrike, the global financial order teeters on the edge of upheavalâone that could redefine power dynamics far beyond Ukraine's battlefields. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas says Russia will not regain frozen assets without paying reparations to Ukraine.Â Watch this video. This video is from theÂ The Prisoner channel on Brighteon.com.

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas says Russia will not regain frozen assets without paying reparations to Ukraine.Â Watch this video. This video is from theÂ The Prisoner channel on Brighteon.com.

"Anyone who delays the decision on the full use of frozen Russian assets is not only limiting our defense, but also slowing down the EU's own progress,"Â he said. Kyiv pledged to use much of the funds to purchase European weapons and bolster air defenses. However, EU leaders, wary of legal blowback, postponed a final decision until December. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the complexity, stating:Â "This is a topic that is certainly not trivial. It's very complex." Russia warns of financial and legal repercussions Moscow has repeatedly condemned the West's efforts to repurpose Russian funds, calling it illegal confiscation. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that any seizure wouldÂ "boomerang"Â on the EU, adding:Â "If someone wants to steal our property, our assets, and illegally appropriate them... they will be subjected to legal prosecution one way or another." Russian Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev reinforced this stance, stating that Moscow has no plans to retaliate against European assetsâunless the EU moves first. "We are not confiscating anything yet. The Europeans haven't called for confiscation, so we won't confiscate anything until they do. If they do end up confiscating, then we will consider it,"Â he said.

Russia's stance is clear and resolute: it views the move as a violation of international law and a hostile act that it will not tolerate. Russia has taken countermeasures and threatened further action to protect its assets and economy. Legal experts warn that Russia could sue Euroclear in international courts, potentially reclaiming seized assets and destabilizing Western finance. Financial analyst Jim Rickards has cautioned that such a scenario could trigger a crisis, exposing the West'sÂ "theft scheme"Â and leaving financial institutions scrambling.

Reports indicate Kyiv is already on the brink of default, withÂ 20 billion in suspended debt payments to investors like BlackRock. Meanwhile, the U.S. faces its own dilemmaâif Russia successfully reclaims frozen assets, Washington may default on obligations tied to Ukraine's 50 billion loan, accelerating the dollar's decline.

Title: 10 Discontinued Costco Items That Members Want Back
URL: https://www.mentalfloss.com/culture/business/discontinued-costco-items
Time Published: 2025-10-24T22:01:00Z
Full Content:
How successful is Costco? The warehouse giant recently reported net sales of roughly $21 billionâand that was just for the month of July 2025. The membership club attracts and keeps customers spending those billions by offering a wide variety of high-quality products at discount prices. Consumers are especially devoted to their Kirkland Signature line, the brandâs in-house label that covers everything from tea to toilet paper. Sometimes, well-reviewed items donât stay on shelves. For a variety of reasons, Costco has discontinued, eliminated, or otherwise removed popular products. Take a look at 10 retired items that caused a lot of member uproar. (Note: Some items may have been reported as discontinued, only to return as a seasonal item or in a revamped version. Itâs always possible youâll spot a lamented and presumed-lost item at your local Costco.) The $1.50 hot dog and soda combo aside, Costcoâs food court might be the most unpredictable department in the chain. In 2024, the store opted to remove its twisted churros (fried and sugar-dusted dough) from the menu. According to The Spruce Eats, it was the second time Costco had ditched the dessert, having discontinued an untwisted version back in 2021. In its place was a double chocolate chunk cookie. If that doesnât fill the churro-sized hole in your gut, you can opt for the prepackaged Gen Bake Churro Donut Bites. Costcoâs musical chairs at the food court persisted with the removal of their Polish hot dog, a spicy sausage variation of their classic, back in 2018. In a rare moment of public contrition over a defunct item, Costco stated that âIn order to simplify our menu and make room for healthier options, we have decided to offer only the all-beef Hot Dog. Sales show this is what the majority of members prefer. Though we understand many members loved the Polish Dog, we hope you enjoy our new offerings.â Add Mental Floss as a preferred news source! This chocolate-on-chocolate-on-chocolate layer cake was a favorite among bakery customers for its uninhibited decadence. The 7-pound chocolate cake with a chocolate mousse center was surrounded by fudge icing and chocolate shavings. A combination of pandemic cutbacks and modest sales led to it being pulled, though loyalists tried to get Costco to reverse course: A Change.org petition to bring the cake back drew over 8500 signatures. It didnât work, but Costco does offer a miniature version sans the mousse center. This dairy-free alternative was sold in 32-ounce containers (in packs of 12) and became popular among those unable or unwilling to tolerate lactose. Then, in 2025, it was swiftly pulled: consumers began leaving âreviewsâ on Costcoâs website imploring them to bring it back. According to Readerâs Digest, poor sales were to blame, though the company might introduce another branded soy milk in the near future. As late as 2013, Costco members could approach the food court and request that an employee hand-dip an ice cream bar in vats of chocolate and almonds. Those days are now over. One possible motive was the rising prices of dairy and almonds at the time. That, coupled with poor sales, may have led to its demise. A few years later, chocolate yogurt was also pulled from the menu. In its placeâat least in San Luis Obispo, Californiaâwas an aÃ§aÃ­ bowl. Costcoâs $1.99 pizza slices have stirred up strong feelings among customers. Aside from cheese and pepperoni, there used to be a third option: a combo, or supreme, pizza that consisted of sausage, red onions, pepperoni, green bell peppers, mushrooms, and black olives. It disappeared from the food court in 2020, but not from the store itself. A take-and-bake frozen version is still available in select regions. In 2025, the store was also offering a combo calzone with many of the same ingredients but at a steeper $6.99 price. Home baking enthusiasts were dismayed by the abrupt disappearance of Kirklandâs semi-sweet chocolate chips and 51 percent semi-sweet chips in 2024. The reason? Costco was having trouble keeping its price competitive given the rising cost of cocoa. Instead, the warehouse is offering NestlÃ© Toll House semi-sweet chocolate morsels. Costcoâs bakery was once home to enormous breakfast muffins. As is the custom in warehouse clubs, consumers were forced to purchase them in twin packs of 6 (12 total), making for a true commitment to carbs. In 2024, the company replaced the jumbo muffins with a smaller version, allegedly in response to people complaining there was simply too much muffin to consume at once.Â The muffin serving might have shrunk, but the price did not. At $6.99 per 8-pack, the reasonable size is 50 percent more expensive than the jumbo muffins ($9.99 for 12) on a per-ounce basis. Perk Description Home and Auto Insurance Members can get a break on insurance premiums via Costco's partnership with Connect. In-Home Water Delivery Costco delivers Primo water and offers dispenser rentals for home or office. Tech Support Costco can walk members through new TV, PC, and phone gadgets via a toll-free number (866-861-0450). Travel Packages Members can save on vacation packages when booking via Costco. Bulk Movie Tickets Love movies? You can save on admission by buying Regal, Cinemark, or AMC gift cards or bulk tickets sold for less than face value While not an exclusive item, books are nonetheless no more at Costco. After years of selling hardcover and paperback titles at a discount, in 2024 the company announced it would no longer be regularly stocking books. The sheer tonnage of titles made restocking labor-intensive for employees. Instead, Costco plans to offer books during the fall and winter holiday buying season only. If you donât remember grabbing Kirkland-branded mayo in recent years, thereâs a reason: Costco actually discontinued the product before it ever reached store shelves. The company had issues with its supplier perfecting the recipe: The addition of omega-3 fatty acids, intended to boost its nutritional profile, wound up disrupting the consistency. The company may try again in the future. In the meantime, thereâs always 64 ounces of Hellmanâs.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Ford Leads Automakers Higher; Deckers Drops

Shares of a major automaker surged Friday on a strong earnings report, while a shoes and apparel maker lost ground after warning tariffs and higher prices could discourage shoppers. Major U.S. equities indexes finished the week at record highs after the release of a cooler-than-expected inflation report, reinforcing expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week. The Nasdaq rose 1.2%, the S&P 500 added 0.8%, and the Dow climbed 1% to finish above 47000 for the first time. All three indexes posted roughly 2% gains for the week. See here for more coverage from Investopedia of Friday's market moves. Ford Motor (F) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Friday, soaring over 12% after the automaker posted third-quarter earnings that topped analysts' estimates. The strong results overshadowed a cut to Ford's outlook, related to the impacts of a fire at an aluminum supplier. Shares of other big automakers, including General Motors (GM), also rose. Tesla (TSLA), which reported quarterly results late Wednesday, finished more than 3% lower. Shares of International Business Machines (IBM) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped nearly 8% to finish at record highs following a report that IBM found it could run a key quantum computing error-correcting algorithm on an easy-to-get and reasonably priced chip made by AMD. Micron Technology (MU), which supplies memory solutions for AMD and Nvidia (NVDA) chips, also gained following the news, adding 6%. The SOX index of semiconductor stocks finished the day up 1.9%. Deckers Outdoor (DECK) shares plunged more than 15% to lead decliners on the benchmark index. The Ugg and Hoka shoe maker gave a weaker-than-expected outlook, saying it anticipates a pullback in consumer spending because of tariffs and higher prices. Shares of Newmont (NEM), the world's largest gold miner, fell 6.2% amid concerns about its production outlook, though its third-quarter results topped analysts' estimates as the price of gold has lately surged.

Shares of a major automaker surged Friday on a strong earnings report, while a shoes and apparel maker lost ground after warning tariffs and higher prices could discourage shoppers. Major U.S. equities indexes finished the week at record highs after the release of a cooler-than-expected inflation report, reinforcing expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week. The Nasdaq rose 1.2%, the S&P 500 added 0.8%, and the Dow climbed 1% to finish above 47000 for the first time. All three indexes posted roughly 2% gains for the week. See here for more coverage from Investopedia of Friday's market moves. Ford Motor (F) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Friday, soaring over 12% after the automaker posted third-quarter earnings that topped analysts' estimates. The strong results overshadowed a cut to Ford's outlook, related to the impacts of a fire at an aluminum supplier. Shares of other big automakers, including General Motors (GM), also rose. Tesla (TSLA), which reported quarterly results late Wednesday, finished more than 3% lower. Shares of International Business Machines (IBM) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped nearly 8% to finish at record highs following a report that IBM found it could run a key quantum computing error-correcting algorithm on an easy-to-get and reasonably priced chip made by AMD. Micron Technology (MU), which supplies memory solutions for AMD and Nvidia (NVDA) chips, also gained following the news, adding 6%. The SOX index of semiconductor stocks finished the day up 1.9%. Deckers Outdoor (DECK) shares plunged more than 15% to lead decliners on the benchmark index. The Ugg and Hoka shoe maker gave a weaker-than-expected outlook, saying it anticipates a pullback in consumer spending because of tariffs and higher prices. Shares of Newmont (NEM), the world's largest gold miner, fell 6.2% amid concerns about its production outlook, though its third-quarter results topped analysts' estimates as the price of gold has lately surged.

It seems it took nearly a year for Apple just to move a couple of points higher to get an ATH, thanks to A.I. mania pulling all the money from investors. It’s just crazy how a few CEOs can move the whole market direction based on deception and FOMO. Many companies that are spending huge amounts of money on A.I. capex aren’t even profitable. Fundamentals have been tossed aside for possible future gains. Yet when someone says iPhone sales MIGHT be flat, investors panic and sell. It’s so weird. Anyway, I’m glad Apple hasn’t thrown away tens of billions on A.I. nonsense. I prefer human intelligence over A.I. intelligence. Maybe someday people will wake up when a quarter of U.S. citizens are unemployed. The last time Apple was this high was on the back of Apple Intelligence hype, then it sank when it became apparent it was vaporware (for now) AI is here to stay just like the Internet. There may be a dot AI bust because of the froth. Every technology takes away one kind of employment and generates the other kind just like the Internet. The AI gene is out of the bottle, you cannot bottle it in whether you like it or not, remember Netscape and Bill Gates memo to his employees about changing the direction of his ‘ship.’ A big company like Apple can not ignore strong megatrends in technology just by saying , ‘human intelligence’ is better than ‘machine intelligence.’ Your email address will not be published.

Title: Trump’s Faltering Economy
URL: http://prospect.org/2025/10/24/trumps-faltering-economy/
Time Published: 2025-10-24T19:00:00Z
Full Content:
The Consumer Price Index for September increased at an annual rate of 3.0 percent, the Labor Department reported this morning. This was an increase from 2.9 percent in August, 2.7 percent in July, and around 2.3 percent this past spring, before Trump’s perverse policies began to bite. Inflation of 3 percent doesn’t seem too bad, but it conceals a great deal of softness in the economy. That weakness will be sufficiently worrisome for the Fed to likely proceed with its planned quarter-point rate cut when the Federal Open Market Committee meets next week. But after that, both inflation and unemployment are likely to worsen, leaving the Fed with no good options. More from Robert Kuttner On the inflation front, Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs have yet to fully bite, but their impact is likely to increase over time. Other specific price hikes, as in health insurance under the ACA, will begin to hit only in November, although health insurance costs generally are already more than 6 percent over last year’s. In addition, Trump’s killing of antitrust enforcement and other consumer protections is allowing a lot of opportunistic price increases that reflect abuses of market power. Employment is also weakening. With the Bureau of Labor Statistics staff mostly on furlough because of the government shutdown, precise numbers on joblessness are not available. But myriad indicators of a soft job market are unmistakable. Trump’s rescissions of federal spending and layoffs of federal employees raise the unemployment rate directly, and have cascaded throughout the economy. As Paul Krugman has observed, every job indicator is soft and getting softer. New hires are barely above the rate of the Great Recession. The rate of long-term unemployment—more than six months without a job—soared in August, and updated numbers are likely to be worse but not available because of the government shutdown. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Jobless rates were higher in August than a year earlier in 243 of the 387 metropolitan areas. More and more corporations are announcing or planning layoffs, including Microsoft, Meta, Intel, Target, and Kohl’s. Amazon plans to replace 600,000 warehouse workers with robots. One of the most alarming indicators of a risky economy is the heavy reliance on spending by the wealthiest consumers. In a recent speech, Fed governor Christopher Waller, one of Trump’s own appointees no less, pointed out that consumption is heavily skewed to rich people because of the gross inequality in the economy and the stock boom, which many economists think is a bubble. Waller said, “The highest-earning 10 percent of households are responsible for 22 percent of personal consumption. The top 20 percent of households spend 35 percent of the total. Their share of stock market wealth is even more skewed.” In fact, the top 10 percent of households own 87 percent of stocks, while the bottom half own hardly any. Moreover, a great deal of capital investment and the stock market boom are driven by artificial intelligence. “Artificial” is the right word. At some point, that bubble is likely to burst, and luxury spending with it. All told, the seemingly not-too-bad Trump economy is living on borrowed time. You might wonder how the BLS was able to release this report despite the government shutdown. The answer is that the September data were collected before the shutdown began. Even so, the release date had to be postponed from October 15 to October 24, while the BLS got a special exemption to bring back a skeleton crew of economists and IT specialists to get the report out, but only to work on inflation and not on employment. This was done because the Social Security cost-of-living increase for next year relies on third-quarter data. Next month’s CPI report, based on data that the BLS is supposed to be collecting right now, will likely be inadequate, and even more sketchy the longer the shutdown drags on. But other sources in the public domain are likely to show worsening trends in both prices and jobs. Trump inherited a strong economy. Tearing down the house is the right Trump visual.

Title: Why AMD and IBM Shares Just Took Quantum Leaps to Record Highs?
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/amd-ibm-stock-price-record-high-quantum-computing-11836451
Time Published: 2025-10-24T18:17:28Z

AMD and IBM took quantum leaps on Friday. Shares in the two companies jumped to record highs after Reuters reported that International Business Machines (IBM) has found that it could run a key quantum computing error-correcting algorithm on an easy-to-get and reasonably priced chip made by Advanced Micro Devices. Reuters said that a research paper to be released by IBM Monday shows that it can run those algorithms in real time on a kind of chip—called a field programmable gate array semiconductor— manufactured by AMD. AMD shares, which have more than doubled since the start of the year, were up nearly 7% in mid-afternoon trading Friday. IBM stock surged more than 7%, taking its year-to-date gain to about 40%, making it the second-biggest gainer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2025. Shares of Micron (MU), which makes memory solutions for AMD and Nvidia (NVDA) chips, rose 5% on Friday. For IBM, this breakthrough is progress toward making quantum computers more commercially viable and reliable. For AMD, it shows how affordable, flexible chips are becoming essential in advanced research—and extends the chip maker’s reach in next-generation computing. Jay Gambetta, director of IBM research, said in an interview that "Implementing it, and showing that the implementation is actually 10 times faster than what is needed, is a big deal," according to Reuters. Quantum computers use qubits to solve problems thousands of times faster than conventional computers, Reuters said. However, qubits are prone to making errors that overwhelm quantum chips, and tech companies have been racing to solve the problem. IBM plans to build a quantum computer named Starling by 2029, and Gambetta told Reuters the algorithm work was completed a year earlier than expected.

Title: Watch These Intel Stock Price Levels After Chipmaker's Earnings Blow Past Expectations

Intel (INTC) shares rose Friday morning after the chipmaker swung to a profit that sailed past Wall Street expectations, signaling its closely watched turnaround plan is gaining traction. CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took the helm in March and has refocused the company’s strategic direction, said the third-quarter results show Intel's "steady progress" in its turnaround, adding that demand for AI has created "attractive opportunities" across its portfolio. The stock was up 1.2% at $38.60 in recent trading, after surging above $41 early in the session to its highest level since April 2024. Coming into today's session, the stock had risen 90% so far this year, with the lion’s share of those gains coming in recent months as investors cheered multi-billion dollar investments from Nvidia (NVDA) and SoftBank (SFTBY), as well as the U.S. government’s 10% stake in the chipmaker. Below we analyze the technicals on Intel’s chart and identify important post-earnings price levels worth watching out for after the quarterly report. Intel shares have consolidated in a rectangle formation throughout most of October, setting the stage for a continuation of the stock’s recent uptrend. The trend for the stock has remained bullish since it broke out from a multi-month trading range in September, shortly after the 50-day moving average (MA) crossed above the 200-day MA to form a golden cross, a chart pattern that signals a sustained upward trend. Let’s apply technical analysis to project a potential near-term bullish target on Intel’s chart and also identify important support levels worth watching during future retracements. Investors can project an upside target on Intel’s chart by using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as the measuring principle. When applying the analysis, we calculate the distance of the strong move higher that preceded the rectangle in points and add that amount to the formation's top trendline. For example, we add $10 to $39, which projects a target of $49. During pullbacks in the stock, investors should initially watch the $36 level. This area on the chart could provide support near the base of the rectangle formation and a cluster of prices situated just below the July 2024 swing high. A close below this level could see the shares retreat to around $32. Investors may look for buying opportunities in this area near the high of last month’s breakaway gap and a sideways trend that formed on the chart between April and July last year. Finally, selling below this level opens the door for a retest of a lower trading floor near $29. Intel shares may find support in this location around the late September low, which also closely aligns with the Aug. 1, 2024 closing price that preceded the stock’s significant gap lower the following day.

Title: Google’s XR Studio Releases ‘Job Simulator’ Style MR Experience Exclusive to Android XR
URL: https://www.roadtovr.com/google-xr-studio-job-simulator-sequel-android-xr/
Time Published: 2025-10-24T14:22:20Z
Full Content:
Owlchemy Labs, the Google-owned XR studio, released a new mixed reality title exclusively for Android XR which expands the Job Simulator universe. Owlchemy Labs, the studio behind VR games Job Simulator (2016) and Vacation Simulator (2019), released both games on Android XR’s first officially supported headset, Samsung Galaxy XR. Alongside it comes a free mixed reality experience, called Inside[JOB], which the studio says in a blogpost offers up the “same blend of chaos, humor, and hands-on interaction that helped define modern VR, as well as a first look at our next evolution in spatial experiences.” As an Android XR platform exclusive, Inside Job isn’t a full title as such, but rather what Owlchemy calls an “interactive XR playground,” which puts the series robotic protagonist ‘JobBot’ in the spotlight as he discovers your reality. In Inside Job, users tweak system settings, fish for data, and repair PCs in VR, blending passthrough MR with full VR segments set in the Job Simulator universe. The studio says Inside Job isn’t a sequel as such, but rather “a chance to experiment with our latest hand-tracking tech while solving a series of lighthearted repairs.” The game launched alongside Samsung Galaxy XR this week, priced at $1,800, which is currently the only Android XR headset on the market. You can find Inside Job for free over on the Playstore here. I think it’s pretty clear that Galaxy XR’s high price tag basically excludes it from being a viable outlet for large-format, system-selling exclusives, which is why gamers probably shouldn’t wring their hands and yell into the heavens with full-on FOMO just yet. Basically, it’s a Vision Pro, but cheaper, and with access to Android apps and maybe a few Quest ports. That’s very cool for XR obsessed people like you and me, and also companies looking to build enterprise apps, but not many others right now. The real question on my mind is “what’s really next for Owlchemy Labs?” I suspect the answer to that question won’t materialize so quickly. As a reminder, Owlchemy Labs has developed some of the best-selling games in the medium, so they’re probably hoping to jump in at the right moment—but it’s difficult to intuit when that might be. Olwchemy Labs says in a recent blogpost that porting their games to Android XR has allowed them to “experiment with new layers of immersion through native support for hand, eye, and face tracking.” I can bet other established XR studios are interested in mobilizing those hardware features too, if only in service of deepening user immersion, but I’m skeptical of whether will be enough. I’ll admit it: the next XR headset wave may well come when consumers can eventually choose between a cheap and cheerful Android XR headset, a next-gen Quest, and possibly even Valve’s rumored Steam Frame (aka ‘Deckard’). But I have a hard time believing face and eye-tracking alone will be additive enough to the glut of consumers. Yes, future headsets will probably have higher resolutions, more processing power, and hopefully be lighter and more comfortable than they are now. But at risk of belaboring the point, all of it needs to hit a real consumer price point to move the needle. Notably, there are a few consumer headsets on the market with face and eye-tracking currently: VIVE XR Elite, Pico 4 Pro, and Apple Vision Pro, the latter of which just launched its M5 hardware refresh for $3,500. None of those have garnered the incumbent consumer support to make them de facto competitors to Meta’s Quest 3/3S platform though. As an aside, Quest 3 is essentially a Quest Pro without face and eye-tracking—or the $1,500 price tag—which was eventually reduced to $1,000 to flush stock before it was discontinued earlier this year. Meta learned that lesson early on, it seems. Assuming the studio wants to continue pushing the boundaries of immersive design at scale like it did with Job Simulator in 2016, I’d imagine they’re doing what most developers are at this point: i.e. using these prosumer headsets as ad hoc developer kits in preparation for the next big consumer headset generation yet to come. When that will be, I just can’t say. This article may contain affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and buy a product we may receive a small commission which helps support the publication. More information. I hope the guys at Owlchemy Labs have made some improvements in their hand-tracking interactions for the new Galaxy XR game. When they added hand-tracking to Job Simulator, I gave it a try on my Quest 3. During the short-order cook job, there is a spot where you have to pick up a can of soup and move it from one counter to another. Without any tactile feedback, I could not maintain the exact distance between my thumb and index finger while turning. Every time, my fingers would move slightly apart and the software said, 'Oh, you want to release the can', and the can would drop to the floor. Versus just holding down the grip button on the controller to hold the soup can. Okay, this particular instance could have been solved with a minor adjustment of the tolerances on their part, but it just highlights limitation on hand-tracking when you are trying to grip something that is not there in the real world versus using a controller. Already 1000 downloads on play store, not a bad start! Owlchemy released a teaser during Gamescom 2022 that didn't show any gameplay, but focused on the social interaction between the three women playing it from different locations using hand tracking. The women were wearing Quest 2 as the main standalone HMD available back then, but what was shown would have been technically impossible on a Quest 2 or even Quest 3, both lacking down-facing cameras for hand tracking close to the face, as shown in teaser. Plus things like playing outside in bright sunlight and a couple of other interactions that won't work on a Meta HMD either. I was pretty sure that this would be a teaser for an unannounced AVP game. Owlchemy had worked with several VR platform owners for launch titles with an excellent reputation for games featuring interaction with objects, so it wasn't out of the question that Apple would have contacted them for their "this is a social experience, not isolating VR" AVP, and that Google might have allowed it. Plus the trailer looked very Apple style. youtu_be/ZjVhOEKSEjM But whatever the teaser was teasing never materialized, despite Owlchemy's CEO hyping up hand tracking use in games: Hand tracking has provided an unprecedented level of communication between players. Bundle this new technology with players experiencing our quirky worlds with friends and you have all the ingredients for a magical VR experience. Their COO then added The first time we saw and used our own hands in VR we realized this is the future of the platform. Hand tracking lowers the barrier of entry into VR, making games more accessible and intuitive to more people. Playing games is much more fun when you’re using your actual body as the controller. Ever since we launched Job Simulator, VR players have been requesting a multiplayer game from Owlchemy. Our next project lets friends enjoy the classic Owlchemy experience together, with hand tracking opening the door to a whole new world of VR interactions. They have released Dimensional Double Shift since that also offered the promised multi-player, but this was more focused on jumping on the free to play wagon driving Quest's user growth with a very young audience, not the hand tracking adult shared experience the teaser showed. So maybe "what’s really next for Owlchemy Labs?” is finally releasing what they teased back in 2022, now that there is a Google driven HMD that could actually deliver this type of experience.

Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) upgraded Coinbase (COIN) to "overweight" from "neutral" and raised its price target to $404, citing new monetization opportunities and reduced risks that make the crypto exchange appear more attractive compared to its peers. The shares were about 4% higher in early trading, around $332. The bank highlighted two key catalysts: a potential Base token and enhanced USDC payouts. JPMorgan analysts said that Coinbase is exploring a token for Base, its Layer 2 blockchain launched in August 2023, which has grown into one of the largest in the ecosystem. A token could allow Coinbase to capture more of Base’s growth, with the bank estimating a possible $12 billion to $34 billion market cap and up to $12 billion in value accruing to Coinbase. The move, JPMorgan said, could spur development, community participation and long-term infrastructure growth. The bank's analysts also noted Coinbase’s efforts to better monetize USDC by offering yields to customers through its Coinbase One subscription service. By segmenting users and offering 4% returns to subscribers, Coinbase could add about $1 per share in annual earnings, JPMorgan said. While competition from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) remains a risk, the analysts said market share between DEXs and centralized exchanges has stabilized. It added that Coinbase’s integrated model, spanning brokerage, market making, exchange and custody, should help sustain profitability even if fees decline. JPMorgan valued Coinbase at 50 times projected 2027 earnings, factoring in $4 billion from a potential Base token, and set a December 2026 price target of $404.

Title: This 7.7% Dividend Is The Last Cheap AI Stock

Time Published: 2025-10-24T12:15:00Z

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. If I can give you one piece of advice now, it’s this: Don’t fear this talk of an AI bubble. In fact, we should love it, because it’s set to hand us a shot at big dividends and gains—especially in closed-end funds (CEFs), which yield around 8% today and regularly hand us “dividend deals” that simply shouldn’t exist. Our job: Buy, then ride along as CEF investors, who tend to be slowpokes compared to stock buyers, finally come around and bid our funds’ prices up. And we collect those rich dividends—often paid monthly—while we wait. One CEF is giving us just such a nonsensical discount today: a 7.7%-payer called the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO). This one holds many key AI players, including Meta Platforms (META), NVIDIA (NVDA), Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT), as well as some companies that stand to gain as they work AI into their daily operations, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup (C). With most of these stocks skyrocketing, AIO should be pricey (“artificial intelligence” is right in the name, after all!). But it’s ridiculously cheap, trading at a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the AI stocks it owns). And any selloff in AI stocks would make it even cheaper. Which leads us back to the question on everyone’s mind: Are we in an AI-driven bubble? That’s critical to a buy of AIO now, so let’s dive in. We’ll start with an often-overlooked measure of where people’s heads are: a chart of common Google searches, in this case for the term “stock market bubble.” You can see at the right side of this chart that the term has been gaining since hitting a low in September 2024. It’s now at its highest point in almost five years. Why the bubble fears? Well, if you’ve been investing for a long time, your experience likely includes the popping of two major bubbles: the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and real estate in 2008. A couple generations were traumatized by those events, and as a result, we’re now in a kind of “bubble” of bubble talk. But are we really in an AI bubble? I’d say no. To start, let’s present the bubble case at its most dire: A Harvard academic recently suggested that, without AI investment, America’s GDP growth would’ve been a meager 0.1% in the first half of 2025. There are a lot of problems with this argument. For one, it ignores the fact that a lot of AI investment is imported from abroad (Bloomberg estimates that imports account for about half of all AI investment), and GDP only measures productivity inside a country. Bloomberg estimates that America’s 1.6% growth in the first half of 2025 would probably be more like 1.1% without AI investment. So, to be sure, AI is contributing much, but not most, of the country’s GDP growth, let alone all of it. Anyone trying to convince you otherwise is simply fear-mongering. Don’t take the bait—especially when other indicators point to a stable economy: This chart, for example, tells us that over the last year, Americans have been less delinquent on their credit cards than they were a year ago, and the overall percentage is pretty small—now about 3.1%, much lower than it was in the 1990s and 2000s. But let’s keep the focus on AI for a moment longer, because it sets up just how out of step that discount on our 7.7%-paying AI fund, AIO, really is. This chart comes from a recent Yale study showing that the share of workers exposed to AI hasn’t changed since the tech was released. “If AI were automating jobs at scale, we would expect to see a smaller share of workers in some of the jobs that are most negatively impacted,” the authors wrote. Yet this chart shows no change at all. In other words, AI isn’t making Americans poorer. It isn’t taking their jobs, and it isn’t a bubble set to burst. That doesn’t mean it won’t turn into any of those things—but it is none of them now. And that sets us up for a tempting trade. If AI starts taking jobs or making Americans feel more uncertain, we should expect a stock pullback that would hit all sectors, including AI names like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta and, of course, NVIDIA. If AI doesn’t take jobs because the tech doesn’t wind up meeting expectations, AI investment will drop and, again, take down names like Google, Meta and NVIDIA. Of course, everyone is watching these companies’ stocks like hawks, eager to sell at any sign of trouble. And that’s why, if we see a selloff driven by fear that any of the above-mentioned things will happen without data backing that up, they’ll be great buys. That’s where AIO comes back into the picture. It’s a diversified play on AI that rewards investors with that healthy 7.7% dividend, which comes our way monthly. It’s also a fund we know well at my CEF Insider service: We bought it in September 2020—long before AI was on investors’ radar—and rode it to a nice 23% total return (including its 6.4% dividend at the time we bought) in the following three years. And, as I mentioned before, AIO is cheap today. In fact, it’s cheaper than it was during the April “tariff terror, ” if you can believe it. That’s a setup that makes no sense at all! Yet here it is: We saw last spring’s deep discount flip to a premium by June. Now that premium has disappeared again, and AIO is back in bargain-bin territory. That doesn’t mean it’s worth buying now—but it does mean AIO is more sensitive to sentiment than the AI stocks it invests in. If investors sell off AI stocks, they’ll sell off AIO aggressively, opening up an even bigger discount and boosting its yield (since prices move in opposition to yields). That will be the time to pounce. Meantime, we’ll keep watching AIO and waiting for that bigger dividend, and discount, to materialize, thanks to the crowd’s overwrought bubble fears.

Title: Wall Street Banks Come to the “Rescue” of Milei’s Argentina Just Days Before Make-or-Break Elections

Full Content:
JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon landed in Buenos Aires this week to attend an event the Wall Street lender is holding, precisely at a time that the bank is in negotiations to arrange a $20 billion loan for the Argentine government. The timing was apparently pure coincidence, given the event was organised long before talk of a rescue package, reports Bloomberg: [B]ut it means some of the bank’s top brass will be on the ground just as doubts grow that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will be able to pull off the second half of his rescue package for the Javier Milei government: a $20 billion bank-led loan. Other Wall Street banks involved include Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Citigroup. If they were to activate credit lines for Argentina, it would bolster the USD 20 billion currency swap that was formalised on Monday, notes Bloomberg. Time is of the essence, however, given the country will vote in mid-term legislative elections on Sunday and the country’s peso continues to sink despite the Trump administration’s rescue package. There’s a lot riding on the results, including that rescue package: BREAKING: In a shocking moment, Trump appears to engage in foreign election interference, saying the U.S. will only give Argentina foreign aid if his pal Milei wins. "If he loses, we will not be generous with Argentina." Extreme corruption.pic.twitter.com/RJ1DjFMgm8 — Really American 🇺🇸 (@ReallyAmerican1) October 14, 2025 Dimon will be joined on his visit by the current joint chairman of JP Morgan’s International Council, Tony Blair, who will be taking a few days out from his new role as “modern-day high commissioner” of Gaza, and former US Secretary of State Condeleeza Rice, who also sits on the council. On the weekend, he will take part in a polo tournament. Before that, Dimon is expected to meet with members of Milei’s senior economic team during his stay. He should receive a warm welcome considering all four of them, including Economy Minister Luis Caputo and Central Bank Governor Santiago Busilli, are former JP Morgan Chase executives. The following photo has been doing the rounds in recent days. Argentina's right-wing libertarian government is run by Wall Street, both indirectly and directly. President Javier Milei's minister & vice minister of the economy, and the president & vice president of the central bank, all previously worked for JPMorgan, the largest US bank. https://t.co/k9yqKikxge pic.twitter.com/1LUSXhrq3O — Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) October 21, 2025 What were the odds of all four of them having previously worked for the same New York-based mega lender whose operations in Argentina are apparently expanding quite nicely right now? That same bank is now helping the Milei government carry out a sovereign debt buyback operation ostensibly aimed at “reducing the country’s cost of financing and strengthening investment in education”? An Oligarch’s Libertarian It was Milei’s appointment of Caputo and Bausili back in December 2023 that was the obvious tell that the fix was once again in, that Milei’s government was not going to honour his main electoral pledges to abolish Argentina’s central bank or adopt the dollar. As Yannis Varoufakis argues in an excellent piece for Unherd (and as we’ve been arguing for the past two years), Milei is not a libertarian by any means but is instead beholden to Argentina’s oligarchy: Milei never really broke with Argentina’s sad oligarchic practices of the past. He merely rebranded a type of heist practised by a long succession of his predecessors — from Peronist Carlos Menem and anti-Peronist Fernando de la Rúa to hapless Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, whose presidency lasted a mere seven days, and, more recently, neoliberal Mauricio Macri who now supports Milei. While Milei used libertarian narratives successfully to distance himself from these people, his actual policies fail the most important libertarian litmus test. Before you, dear reader, dismiss me as a Marxist (that I admittedly am) intent on dismissing a political opponent’s success as a dismal failure (something I avoid like a mortal sin), let me put it to you in simple, libertarian terms. If you (unlike me) truly believe in the markets’ superior wisdom, and want to rid Argentina of political constraints placed on the market mechanism, which market do you liberate first? The money market, surely. Which price distortion do you drive your chainsaw through first? The fixed (or bounded) exchange rate, unquestionably. And what is the last thing you do? Precisely what Milei did: borrow zillions of dollars, pile them up on top of an already unbearable heap of public debt, to prevent the money market from choosing freely the exchange rate of your currency. Defending a currency as weak as the peso for almost two years is, of course, a fool’s errand, and the results have been depressingly familiar. In less than two years, the Milei government has burnt through tens of billions of dollars of foreign exchange reserves in a futile bid to keep the peso artificially high and, by extension, inflation artificially low. It has brought misery for the man in the street while making a mint for financial speculators. Yes, Milei’s austerity has reduced inflation, but at the cost of smothering economic activity for two long years and squandering the country’s limited currency reserves. It is also utterly unsustainable. Everyone knows the moment the elections are over, the government will once again devalue the peso, sending inflation soaring once again — that’s why everyone is buying dollars despite the US’ direct support of the peso. To avert an all-out currency collapse, the Milei government has needed not one, but two, massive $40 billion bailouts in the space of just six months — the first from the IMF, World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank, the other from the US Treasury Department’s Exchange Stabilisation Fund and Wall Street Banks. The half-lives of the financial interventions are growing dangerously short. From Benign Neglect to Malign Meddling Both of these bailouts came with big strings attached, but it is the latter that has the most onerous terms — including Trump’s exhortation to Argentine voters to choose the right party in Sunday’s election. Otherwise, he warns, the bailout funds will be withdrawn, tipping Argentina’s economy over the edge. This, lest we forget, is occurring at the same time that the US is bombing speedboats into smithereens in both the Caribbean and the Pacific while beating the drums of war for direct military intervention in Venezuela. In recent days, it has threatened “very serious actions” against Colombia’s left-leaning governments as well as crippling tariffs against Nicaragua. Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out yet another lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO). Yet again, the now-deceased terrorists were engaged in narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific. The… pic.twitter.com/PEaKmakivD — Secretary of War Pete Hegseth (@SecWar) October 23, 2025 After two decades of benign neglect of Latin America (while it bombed the Middle East, Libya and Afghanistan to pieces), the US is back to its traditional practice of malign meddling in its resource-rich “backyard”. The old policy of plata o plomo (silver or lead) is back on the agenda as the Trump administration tries to drive a wedge between Latin America and China. Take the money or take a bullet: that is the option on offer. This is not a new thing, of course. The US has been meddling in Latin America for nigh on two centuries. As Chomsky told the British journalist Seamus Milne back in 2009, US foreign policy has long been “straight out of the mafia”: [S]ince government officials first formulated plans for a “grand area” strategy for US global domination in the early 1940s, successive administrations have been guided by a “godfather principle, straight out of the mafia: that defiance cannot be tolerated. It’s a major feature of state policy.” “Successful defiance” has to be punished, even where it damages business interests, as in the economic blockade of Cuba – in case “the contagion spreads”. Will Trump’s overt election meddling and outright extortion practices concentrate the minds of Argentine voters, helping to tip the balance in Milei’s favour this Sunday? It’s unlikely but you never know. Milei still has millions of fanboys and girls (despite scamming thousands of them in his Libra meme coin con) and the opposition is still broadly reviled. However, Trump’s meddling is just as likely, if not more so, to have the opposite of the intended effect. A large majority of Argentines (60%) already have a negative image of Donald J Trump while 56% have a negative image of the United States overall, according to a poll conducted for Bloomberg in April. What’s more, the last six months of economic crisis and non-stop scandals have taken their toll on Milei’s approval ratings. The following exchange, from a recent interview of Milei on a friendly news program by Eduardo Feinmann, a presenter with a strong pro-government bias, shows just how quickly Milei’s carefully crafted image as an expert on economic matters is unravelling: Presenter: Eighty percent of Argentineans barely make it to the end of the month, and 60 to 70% of them only make it to the 20th of the month. Milei: How do you want me to fix that? How can I get money to the people? Interviewer: You are the economist. You are the expert in economic growth with or without money. In recent days, even with make-or-break elections looming, an allegedly heavily medicated Milei has refused to do any more interviews with the media, presumably at the insistence of his campaign team. As Luis Majul, another pro-government news presenter put it (emphasis my own), “Milei was going to do an interview (with us) but he took the decision not to come on in case there were questions he could not answer, which seems reasonable to me.” An analysts’ report published by JP Morgan notes that the markets are already discounting a bad election result for Milei’s ruling Libertad Avanza party, which will make it even harder for the government to govern. However, the analysts do not rule out a sharp rebound in Argentine stocks from next week if the result exceeds expectations. As El País reported a month ago, Argentina’s stock market is the world’s worst performer in 2025. Analysts from Wells Fargo have warned that the current exchange bands scheme “does not seem sustainable” and have predicted a further depreciation in the peso of close to 30% by the end of 2026 — the largest among all emerging currencies analysed. They also cautioned that the US Treasury’s support may offer a few days of stability – or even strength – for the Argentine peso, but it does not constitute a sustainable exchange rate policy. In the meantime, the private sector-led rescue agreement still faces obstacles. The banks involved — including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup — are demanding clear guarantees to back the loan, either from the US Treasury or the Argentine State itself. From Perfil (translated by yours truly): At the crux of the negotiations is the question of who will serve as guarantor of the loan: the Argentine government or the US Treasury itself. Banks are pushing for tangible backing, whether with assets, reserves or official coverage from Washington, that minimizes the risk of losses. In this context, The Wall Street Journal points out that Argentina could offer sovereign bonds or future tax revenues as collateral, although those options are considered unviable. Local bonds are worth well below their face value, and compromising future collections could generate political rejection within the country. Throughout history, this type of operation had solid collateral. In 1995, for example, Mexico guaranteed a $20 billion loan with oil exports during the so-called “Tequila Crisis.” By contrast, the currency swap between the Treasury and Argentina, which is also part of the $40 billion package, does not legally require collateral, increasing risks for the U.S. Treasury. At the same time, the Trump administration is facing a gathering backlash from its MAGA base for trying to rescue Argentina, a major agricultural competitor, while the economic pain from Trump’s tariffs intensifies. 🚨 TRUMP: “We’ll buy Argentine beef.” Asked what he’d tell U.S. ranchers losing their farms, he said: “Argentina is fighting for its life… they’re dying.” So are our ranchers, 77 go under every single day. America First apparently ends where the steak begins. pic.twitter.com/sbPImhQc6x — Brian Allen (@allenanalysis) October 21, 2025 Trump’s recent call to buy beef from Argentina could be, if you’ll excuse the pun, the final straw for some of his America-first voters, and is heaping pressure on Republican lawmakers. From Fortune: Trump proposed on Sunday that the U.S. could purchase beef from Argentina as a way to bring down prices for American consumers. Beef costs have ballooned as much as 12% in the past year. The suggestion was met with exasperation from U.S. cattle ranchers, who argued the move would disrupt the free market and introduce unnecessary risk factors to domestic beef supply. “This plan only creates chaos at a critical time of the year for American cattle producers, while doing nothing to lower grocery store prices,” National Cattlemen’s Beef Association CEO Colin Woodall said in a statement on Monday… A potential intervention with Argentina would come just as the U.S. cattle industry was beginning to recover from a dismal 2024, in which it saw its smallest herd since 1951, a result of severe droughts withering pastures and hiking up livestock feed costs. U.S. beef imports have also shrunk due to a ban on Mexican beef in an effort to prevent the spread of screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite found in cattle across the border… Cattle ranchers join the chorus of soybean farmers, who have been outspoken about the impact Trump’s ties with Argentina have on the soybean industry. Amid proposals to offer financial assistance to Argentina last month, the South American country also dropped several export taxes as an effort to stabilize its economy—including its soybean tax. As a result, China, which previously purchased about a quarter U.S.’s soybean exports, ordered several cargoes of the crop. China has not ordered U.S. soybeans since May. “The frustration is overwhelming,” the American Soybean Association (ASA) President Caleb Ragland said in a statement last month. “The farm economy is suffering while our competitors supplant the United States in the biggest soybean import market in the world. Jamie Dimon has a different take, joking that Argentina has “professionals, land, education… even meet.” On the political level, he remarked that Argentina has a real opportunity to become a strategic partner of Washington. “Argentina should be an ally of the United States; Trump and Milei are close, and I celebrate that effort to shorten the distance.” Dimon also contrasted the US presence in Latin America to China’s “Belt and Road” initiative promoted by China, expressing concern about Washington’s lack of a clear strategy to boost economic development in the region. (NC: When has it ever done that?) By contrast, the Chinese initiative — based on free trade, investment in infrastructure and international cooperation — has massively strengthened Beijing’s influence in Latin America. This is one of the reasons why the US is so keen to prop up the Milei government, even if it risks alienating a core section of Trump’s electoral base: the potential advantages of “driving a wedge between Argentina and China” (as the WSJ puts it) outweigh the political and economic costs. At least that’s the calculation. In the following interview with Democracy Now, the Argentine author and journalist Pablo Calvi offers three possible explanations for Washington’s support of the Milei government: geopolitics (removing China from the equation as much as possible); the interests of Trump-adjacent tech bros in Argentina, including Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Sam Altman; and the ideological affinity between Trump and Milei. Trump's $20 billion bailout for Argentina is meant to bolster his right-wing ally President Javier Milei, but the plan "could backfire" for both leaders, says journalist @plcalvi. Argentina is holding legislative elections later this month. pic.twitter.com/Ap0L5Rtoml — Democracy Now! (@democracynow) October 16, 2025 One other possible explanation that Calvi doesn’t mention is the personal and business interests of US Treasury Secretary (and former hedge fund manager) Scott Bessent. As the NYT reported a couple of weeks ago, some hedge fund managers, including Stanley Druckenmiller and Robert Citrone, both former colleagues of Bessent at Soros Asset Management, bet large on Argentina and will indirectly benefit from a financial rescue of Argentine assets. Another major beneficiary will be the IMF, given Argentina now owes the Fund close to $60 billion. Another Argentine default, which may be inevitable anyway, could cause the institution serious embarrassment given that both of the last two bailouts, in 2018 and April 2025, were strongly opposed by senior members at the Fund, some of whom were even prepared to sacrifice their jobs rather than sign along the dotted line. Another source of embarrassment for the Fund: Just a reminder that the IMF's market access debt sustainability framework and in particularly its medium term assessment doesn't use external debt or fx reserves as analytic variables — it is an "it is all fiscal" framework. — Brad Setser (@Brad_Setser) October 22, 2025 Neither the people of Argentina nor the people of the United States stand to benefit from this bailout. As reader Rabid Gandhi pointed out in a comment to Curro’s post yesterday on Latin America, the money will “barely even touch Argentine soil before being whisked away to the Caymans accounts of various hedgies and oligarchs, some of them nominally Argentines, others not even that”: When this capital flight occurs, once again as it always has in the past, it will not be a surprise to Messers Bessent, Trump, Caputo…, because it is by design… What Argentina, the 45 million Argentines, will be getting as their ‘reward’ is a debt in USD, a central bank bereft of reserves and the concomitant austerity/cuts to social services that inevitably follow. With friends like these… So, this leaves us with one final question: what will the Wall Street banks be asking for as collateral for its $20 billion loan? Or put another way, what does Argentina have left to plunder? The last time the US Treasury used ESF funds to bail out another country, it was for Mexico during the 1994-5 Tequila Crisis. Not only are the Mexican people still paying off the debt for that bailout today, 27 years later, but the total amount outstanding has almost doubled in size despite the fact that the country has already paid $200 billion pesos more than the principal: the magical wonders of compound interest. In its bailout of Mexico, the US government made sure the Mexican government put up as collateral for the loan the revenues from oil exports of Mexico’s state-owned oil company, Pemex. Will the Wall Street banks be demanding the same sort of treatment from Argentina’s state-owned company YPF? In its Vaca Muerta (Dead Cow) field, Argentina boasts the world’s fourth largest reserves of shale oil and more shale gas than anywhere except China. Such a move could be complicated, however, by a ruling issued a few months ago by US federal judge Loretta Preska — yes, the same judge who persecuted US lawyer Steven Donziger for daring to represent the people of Ecuador against Chevron — ordering the Milei government to hand over 51% of YPF to firms affected by the oil firm’s 2012 nationalisation. That ruling has been put on hold by a US appeal court but is hanging over Argentina like a sword of Damocles. Alternatively, the Milei government could be asked to put up Argentina’s vast lithium deposits, the second largest in the world, as collateral, or even its uranium deposits. The negotiations between the Milei government and the US Treasury Department have reportedly included demands to restrict Chinese access to critical resources and prioritise agreements with U.S. companies in infrastructure and telecommunications. The Milei government has already begun the process of privatising Argentina’s four hydroelectric power plants, and there will presumably be a lot more of that sort of thing to come — unless, of course, the people of Argentina vote overwhelmingly against Milei’s party on Sunday. If that were to happen, Milei would effectively be stripped of the ability to rule by decree and veto, as he has done for the best part of the past two years. In which case, Bessent’s rescue package will presumably be withheld. And in that case, all bets are off. Austerity and borrowing money in a foreign currency… it’s like the economic version of getting into a land war in Asia. Is there Spanish translation of Mark Blyth? And is there an equivalent of his book on national governments borrowing in a currency they don’t control? Varoufakis certainly has first hand experience, with Greece and the Euro. looks like a target rich environment re: “Trump’s recent call to buy beef from Argentina could be,…:” It’s a gift to Amazon and Walmart, imo, both selling beef and looking for the cheapest buy-price for themselves to sell at the greatest profit to consumers. The Big Four Just Became Five: Walmart Quietly Captures the Beef Chain https://beefnews.org/the-big-four-just-became-five-walmart-quietly-captures-the-beef-chain/ Regarding the final question – I’m no expert in bond markets, but is it possible this is being done with the expectation that Argentina won’t be able to pay? Then Paul Singer of some other vulture capitalist can come in and swoop them up for pennies on the dollar. Could be. See this Mother Jones magazine article. https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/09/trump-argentina-bailout-hedge-fund-billionaire-rob-citrone-scott-bessent/ Oh, and, what is guaranteeing the repayment by Argentina to the US Banks? The US govt! That means US taxpayers. The US Banks won’t take any loss. On the topic of the risks the US taxpayer may be forced to bear, one of the best articles I’ve come across so far is one by Sebastian Pellejero, for Reuters Breaking Views (Spanish language edition). He points out that: 1) These drastic measures are effectively a band-aid to help President Javier Milei get through the difficult midterm elections. Even if they work, Washington may be forced to do more. 2) The cash available in the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund is not unlimited by any means, spread out as it is among the coffers of the International Monetary Fund, foreign exchange reserves and previous commitments, leaving only $23 billion in direct assets of the US government, as of August. 3) The Central Bank of the Argentine Republic’s provisions are now dangerously scarce: around $13 billion, according to the Financial Times. By contrast, Argentina has a short-term foreign currency debt of more than $95 billion. A $20 billion International Monetary Fund loan, approved in April, was supposed to bolster those buffers. However, in August, Argentina had not reached its reserve accumulation target. 4) If Milei’s party loses in Sunday’s election, the United States will have financed a failed economic experiment and will be left holding billions (or more like trillions) of pesos that will collapse in value as soon as market confidence disappears, mainly to the benefit of the lenders who have been paid in full in the interim. 5) Even if Milei’s party wins, the vicious cycle will remain intact, inviting further interventions. There could be pressure to monetise more stabilization fund assets. And leaders of other countries aligned with the Trump White House will see that Uncle Sam can be counted on to lend a helping hand if and whenever necessary. Talk about moral hazard… As I read this thorough and well-written article, Nick, I just continued to shake my head back and forth in wonder and dismay. I’m pretty cynical, but even then, I miss half the connections and schemes. The Due Dissidence guys likened this to the way mobsters drain money from businesses, finally torching them for the insurance money. These billionaires are really, really confident in their suppression technologies. No wonder the first question they asked Rushkoff was how they could insure the loyalty of pilots, security guards, etc. I think the one thing these billionaire sociopaths will never have is true human loyalty. They will have to program it, I guess. Thanks. And thanks for the link to the archived NYT article. The currency swap provided by the US, and the loans made by US banks, are both $20 billion. That has to be just coincidence. That is very good point. So none of this money will go to pay off IMF loan Remember, Austrian economics cannot be failed. Only the government that instills it can fail it. “The Milei government has already begun the process of privatising Argentina’s four hydroelectric power plants, and there will presumably be a lot more of that sort of thing to come — unless, of course, the people of Argentina vote overwhelmingly against Milei’s party on Sunday.” It is always about the future grift, isn’t it. Perhaps there will be a US company lining up to purchase Argentinian public infrastructure at pennies on the dollar? Your email address will not be published.
