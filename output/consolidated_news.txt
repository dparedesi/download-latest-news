Title: Bitwise CEO Praises XRP ETF Performance Amid Record-Setting Inflows, Here Are The Numbers
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-performance-record/
Time Published: 2025-11-27T16:30:28Z
Full Content:
The launch of XRP exchange-traded funds has quickly turned into one of the strongest openings the crypto ETF market has seen this year. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley publicly celebrated the early success of his firm’s product, pointing to a surge in investor interest that has driven inflows to nine figures in a couple of days. His comments come at a time when total XRP ETF inflows across the industry are climbing, whereas Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are finding it difficult to maintain the same level of demand they had in the past. The Bitwise Spot XRP ETF started trading on November 20 after going live based on the new fast-track SEC guidelines for launching ETFs. Since then, the ETF has witnessed consistent days of inflows. Horsley revealed that the Bitwise XRP ETF recently recorded roughly $18 million of inflows in one trading session. This huge amount is one of the fund’s strongest days yet and demonstrates that institutional investors are taking active positions rather than waiting on the sidelines. The CEO emphasized gratitude to those allocating capital to Bitwise’s product, describing the inflow strength as a sign of confidence in both XRP as an asset and Bitwise as a manager. “Grateful to investors entrusting Bitwise to steward their asset,” he said. The timing of these inflows also shows the bullish momentum across XRP ETFs, with multiple issuers reporting consistent interest since regulatory approval. This is interesting, considering the spot price of the altcoin has been going through a not-so-favorable period in November. According to Horsley, the Bitwise XRP ETF has now attracted approximately $135 million in inflows over its first three days of trading. This pace places it among the fastest-growing altcoin ETFs launched in the United States, although still behind early-stage numbers associated with Bitcoin or Ethereum products. These inflow numbers show the pent-up demand for institutional-grade exposure to the cryptocurrency. In addition to Bitwise, industry-wide XRP ETF data shows that the new products collectively brought in about $164 million on Monday, October 24. In total, the four US-based ETFs have witnessed $643.92 million in inflows since launch, with no day of outflow yet to be recorded. The strong early adoption contrasts sharply with the hesitation seen among some heavyweight ETF issuers. Firms like BlackRock and FIdelity are yet to launch their own version of a Spot XRP ETF, leaving the current wave of inflows to be dominated by Bitwise, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton. Their absence has not stopped the momentum flowing into XRP, though it has kept the scale of inflows below what it could become once the larger issuers eventually join the field.

Title: Dublin Airport warns of delays as taxi drivers to stage protest this evening

Dublin Stock image Dublin Airport has warned passengers of possible delays this evening as taxi drivers are set to stage a protest across the city. In a passenger advisory issued this afternoon, the airport said the demonstration due to take place between 4.30pm and 6.30pm, may lead to “heavier than usual” congestion on roads approaching Dublin Airport. “Some delays are possible,” it warned, advising those with flights to give themselves “plenty of time” for their journey. Airport Police will work alongside gardaí and local authority traffic management teams in an effort to minimise disruption for passengers and staff. The protest comes amid an escalating dispute between taxi drivers and Uber over the company’s recently introduced fixed-fare option, which drivers claim undermines the regulated fare structure set by the National Transport Authority. Uber recently introduced the optional fixed-price model, guaranteeing passengers a maximum fare upfront instead of the usual estimated range that can rise with traffic or route changes. Organisers have said that they “sincerely apologise” for disruption but insisted the protest is necessary. Some 1,500 taxi drivers are set to engage in a ‘slow drive’ at three points including Dublin Airport, Clontarf, and Phoenix Park, from 4.30pm this evening, before converging on Government Buildings. Stock image Today's News in 90 Seconds - Thursday, November 27 It marks a second round of protests following demonstrations outside Leinster House last Saturday, with today’s protests sparked by the reported failure of the Government to meet a talks ultimatum by Monday evening. The company says it will reduce “meter anxiety”, and passengers will still pay the lower amount if the meter comes in under the fixed price. Taxi drivers are also asking Dublin Airport to stop facilitating Uber at the airport, saying that the introduction of fixed fares will have a “detrimental” impact on their livelihoods. Driver representatives say the model leaves many earning less during heavy traffic and have warned that further action is likely unless the issue is addressed. Taxi drivers fear other app operators will follow Uber’s lead in introducing fixed fares, ultimately weakening the role of the meter and increasing dependency on platform-controlled pricing. The NTA has been criticised by drivers for not intervening in the dispute to date. The authority has previously said that taxi fares are set under its regulatory framework and that operators must comply with those rules. The NTA has been contacted for comment. “It’s unacceptable, and it’s becoming normalised,” says the chief operating officer of Bohemians Football Club on Ireland’s rising numbers of child homelessness.

Title: The Only 3 Ways to Actually Make Money in B2B AI (And Why “AI-Enhanced” Doesn’t Count Anymore)

by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blog Posts, SaaStr.Ai Most B2B companies claiming to be “AI-powered” aren’t seeing growth accelerate. Not because their technology doesn’t work, but because they’re playing the wrong game entirely. Path 1: Attach to Compute Infrastructure Path 2: Replace Human Headcount Path 3: Massively Displace an Incumbent Everything else is noise in AI and B2B. Let’s break down why each works, how to know if you’re actually doing it, and where most companies go wrong. DataDog’s 23% stock surge after earnings wasn’t luck. It was the inevitable result of a simple principle: sell to the people building AI, and as they grow, you grow automatically. “The AI leaders, the hyperscalers — they’re starting to buy like classic B2B companies,” Jason explains. “They’re recycling the same people in procurement. So if you’re attached to AI budget and you’re a DataDog era, you’re actually going to have a great 2026.” Rory adds critical context: “DataDog is a core piece of compute infrastructure and these hyperscalers are the most compute-intensive companies that have ever been known. If you’re selling compute stuff, you should be having a great quarter. If you’re selling routers, switches, interconnects, whatever it takes to stand up Stargate — you’re going to be golden.” The hyperscalers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Meta) are deploying unprecedented amounts of compute. They’re not just buying different things — they’re buying MORE of everything: Here’s the key insight: These companies buy like traditional B2B enterprises, just at 10x the scale and 10x the speed. OpenAI isn’t some mystical different creature when it comes to procurement. They need observability. They need security. They need data tools. They need all the same infrastructure any rapidly-scaling company needs — they just need more of it because they’re deploying more compute than any companies in history. Ask yourself these questions: If you can’t answer yes to at least 2-3 of these, you’re not actually playing the compute infrastructure game. Jason’s prediction: “If you have attached to AI budget and you’re a DataDog era, you’re actually going to have a great 2026.” Why? Because the infrastructure layer is just getting started. The capex spend on AI is still accelerating. Data center buildouts are still in early innings. The hyperscalers are still ramping their compute deployments. Every single piece of software that sits in that stack — from chip to model to deployment — is going to see explosive growth. But you need to actually be IN that stack, not adjacent to it. Here’s where companies get confused. They think, “We help AI companies be more productive, so we’re attached to AI.” No. That’s not the same thing. Compute-attached means your revenue scales automatically with compute deployment. It means you’re essential infrastructure, not a productivity enhancer. It means when Stargate comes online with $100B of compute, your revenue goes up whether you do anything or not. If you’re a project management tool that AI companies use, you’re not compute-attached. You’re just selling to hot companies. That’s fine, but don’t confuse it with the DataDog playbook. “Where are you replacing humans for real?” Jason asks. “Where are you going to go in and reduce the headcount that vendor needs by half?” This is the path most companies claim to be on but aren’t actually delivering. The difference between real human replacement and “AI-enhanced productivity” is stark. Jason runs through his experience deploying 20+ AI agents at SaaStr: “We have Reply for Replit (we call it ‘Reply’). We have RD for Artisan which is an SDR. We have Quali for Qualified. They all have these little desks where there’s no human at it anymore.” But here’s the critical distinction he makes about Replit’s V3 agent: “It is the first one that jumped the line to not being one of the parts of our team, but literally being part of our team just like a human being.” What makes it different? It’s sufficiently autonomous, knowledgeable and powerful to complete material high-value tasks on its own with some daily discussions just like on our team. Not “it helps us be more efficient.” Not “it automates some tasks.” It completes high-value work autonomously with the same level of oversight you’d give a human team member. Jason makes a crucial point: “Most of the time, ‘replacing humans’ is a story.” Here’s how to know if you’re actually replacing humans versus just telling yourself you are: Real Human Replacement: Fake Human Replacement (productivity story): Jason walks through how Gamma could evolve from Path 3 (displacement) to Path 2 (replacement): “When Gamma can do this — go into my Google Calendar, create prospectuses and sales collateral for all 20 sales calls this week, pull all the data on them last year from Salesforce and HubSpot and Marketo, put them all apart, review them once, and then distribute them to the team — Gamma’s part of our team.” That’s not “AI-enhanced PowerPoint creation.” That’s replacing a marketing operations person entirely. “It’s not that far away,” Jason notes. “Not just make me PowerPoint. When Gamma is part of your marketing team rather than a marketing tool, there’s a lot of revenue expansion if they can pull it off.” Jason identifies the key shift happening right now: “The co-pilot was the 2024 story. It didn’t work. It was a ripoff. Spend $30 more a month on Office like no one wanted the ripoff. This year OpenAI and Claude finally actually got good. That’s why Lovable, Replit, Gamma exploded. Next year is AI is part of your team.” 2024: Co-pilots (didn’t work) Tools that made you more efficient but required constant human oversight and direction. 2025: Agents that work (breakthrough year) Applications where AI finally got good enough to deliver real value autonomously. 2026: AI team members (what’s coming) AI that’s sufficiently autonomous to be actual members of your team, not just tools your team uses. That transition from tool to team member is where the revenue explosion happens. Because when AI is a team member, companies will pay team-member prices ($50K-$150K+ per year), not tool prices ($10-$100 per month). If you’re building a company to replace human headcount: Jason’s right that most companies avoid saying this explicitly, but the economics are undeniable: “If you are not removing humans from the equation, you are going to be heavily discounted.” The market is dividing into: You have to choose which game you’re playing. And if you choose Path 2, you need to actually deliver on human replacement, not just talk about it. “You have a third option,” Jason concedes. “Use AI to massively displace an incumbent and steal all the revenue. In fact, that’s the history of B2B software mostly.” This is the path that sounds most familiar to traditional B2B investors. It’s what Salesforce did to Siebel. What HubSpot did to Marketo (before Marketo became HubSpot). What Slack did to email for internal communication. But Jason is deeply skeptical this path works well in the AI era: “I just don’t know how many of our public leaders are in a place to steal their own revenue.” In the traditional SaaS era, you had ~3 years before incumbents would really compete: “You’d be like, well, Salesforce or HubSpot, whoever, it’ll take them like a year and a half to decide if it’s worth cloning. Then they’ll launch something and it’ll be okay because they have smart engineers, but it won’t actually do anything. The first six months it’ll be so feature poor. Then after two years they’ll decide, should I put 100 people on this?” That timeline has collapsed from 3 years to 30 days. Jason shares a brutal example: “I can think of one investment I’ve made that has had five clones in the first 30 days, including one from a cloud leader.” The AI-enabled cloning speed changes everything. Canva is now “borderline competitive” with Gamma — and Canva wasn’t even a competitor when Gamma’s CEO was on the show just months earlier. Jason’s skepticism crystallizes around the most obvious displacement opportunity: CRM. “There’s like 400 AI CRM startups out there all saying they’re going to eat HubSpot’s and Salesforce’s lunch. That’s not exciting to me as an investment. That’s much less exciting than truly replacing 90% of your GTM team.” Why isn’t this exciting? Jason isn’t saying Path 3 is impossible. He’s saying it’s the hardest path and requires specific conditions: You need at least 3 of these 4: The Duolingo discussion illuminates why incumbent displacement is so hard for public companies. Duolingo displaced Berlitz and traditional language schools. Hooray. But now what? Jason: “Where are you going to disrupt humans? This is your job. You already disrupted those humans. Unfortunately, they’re gone. Where’s the next level of human disruption?” Rory sees the opportunity: “The next generation of companies that are going to be teaching a foreign language will be LLM-based. We’ve seen companies doing more professional, more interactive teaching using LLMs. There’s a whole ton to be done in terms of one-on-one instruction.” But here’s the problem: Duolingo can’t easily displace itself. They have a business model built around light learning at consumer prices ($10-20/month). The AI opportunity is intensive learning at tutoring prices ($50-200/month). That requires cannibalizing their existing revenue model. This is why Path 3 is especially hard for incumbents. They’re not in a position to displace themselves. Which creates the opening for startups, but also means you’re starting from zero on distribution against companies with millions of users. Jason’s answer: Only if you can’t play Path 1 or Path 2. “We can fund those deals as investors, but I think the first two categories are much easier — attached to the compute or replace humans — rather than just steal.” The math is simple: All three can work. But Path 3 requires the most capital, the longest timeline, and has the highest failure rate. Jason drops a truth bomb midway through the discussion: “We’re in the Captain Obvious era of investing. You either got something or you ain’t getting funded anyway.” What does this mean for these three paths? If you’re on Path 1 (compute-attached): Your growth should be automatic. If the hyperscalers are deploying 3x more compute and your revenue isn’t growing 2-3x, something is broken. This should be the most “Captain Obvious” path of all. If you’re on Path 2 (replacing humans): Your customers should be measurably reducing headcount or headcount growth. If they’re not, you’re not actually replacing humans — you’re just a productivity tool. If you’re on Path 3 (displacing incumbents): You should be winning deals against the incumbent consistently, not just in small accounts. If you’re only winning when there’s no incumbent, you’re not displacing anyone. The test is simple: Is your success obvious? Or are you explaining why your metrics are actually good despite not looking impressive? Throughout the discussion, the panel keeps coming back to what doesn’t work: using AI to make your existing product better. Jason is blunt: “Using AI to make your product better? That’s table stakes now, not a competitive advantage.” This is the Duolingo problem. They’re using AI to improve their language learning. Great. Every single competitor can do that too. There’s no moat in “we use AI to make our product better.” Rory agrees: “Every single portfolio company at scale should be using AI by this point to make your product better. This is not 2023. You don’t get any kudos for sprinkling AI dust on your product.” In 2023: Adding AI features was novel and impressive. Companies could raise on “we’re adding AI to X.” In 2025: Adding AI features is expected. It’s like saying “we have a mobile app” in 2023. Cool, so does everyone else. The market has moved from “are you using AI?” to “how are you using AI to capture revenue in one of the three ways that actually work?” Let’s be explicit about what isn’t one of the three paths: Not Path 1: “We sell to AI companies” Unless you’re infrastructure they can’t build AI without, this is just selling to hot companies. When the AI boom ends or slows, your growth ends. Not Path 2: “We make teams more efficient with AI” Unless headcount actually goes down or dramatically slows its growth, you’re not replacing humans. You’re selling productivity software. That’s fine, but it’s not Path 2. Not Path 3: “We’re better than the incumbent because we have AI” Unless you’re 10x better and winning head-to-head deals consistently, you’re not displacing anyone. You’re just another alternative. Harry shares a data point that shows how much the market has shifted: A classic enterprise SaaS company grew from $400K to $3M ARR (10x growth). Five years ago, this would have generated five term sheets from top firms. Today: 120 meetings, one term sheet at 12x revenue. Why? Because it’s not playing any of the three games. It’s not compute-attached. It’s not replacing humans. And it’s not dramatically displacing an incumbent with AI. It’s just a good SaaS company growing well. That’s not good enough anymore. Jason: “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes. You’re either Captain Obvious getting funded, or you’re not seeing it anywhere.” If you’re building a company or investing in one, here’s how to think about which path to pursue: Best for: Infrastructure engineers who understand ML workflows, companies with existing relationships in cloud/DevOps Best for: Founders who have done the job they’re replacing, deep understanding of workflow completion, strong AI/agent expertise Best for: Domain experts in industries with weak incumbents, founders with deep incumbent knowledge, situations with massive technological discontinuity If you can do Path 1, do Path 1. It’s the easiest and most capital-efficient. If you can’t do Path 1, do Path 2. The market for replacing humans is massive and underpenetrated. Only do Path 3 if you can’t do the first two or if you have specific advantages (domain expertise, weak incumbent, vertical specialization) that make it compelling. Jason’s final point ties it all together: “If you’re in software today and this isn’t the most exciting time of your lifetime, you’re doing it wrong. This is the first time software has gotten better since the three of us met.” But that excitement only matters if you’re playing one of the three games that actually capture revenue: Everything else — all the “AI-enhanced” products, all the “using AI to be better” positioning, all the sprinkling of AI dust on existing products — that’s not going to generate venture-scale returns. The market is telling us this clearly. DataDog up 23%. Duolingo down 25%. Same week. Both “using AI.” One playing a winning game, one not. Choose your path wisely. Because in 2025/2026, there are only three that actually work. Founder SaaStr Email Address Company Job Title Email Address Get from $0 to $100 Million in ARRwith less stress and more success.

NEXT | How to win the World Championship Hearthstone Tavern Brawl Cruising through old World of Warcraft content is something that I’ve loved doing for many years for the transmog, pets, and mounts, and now we can add Player Housing decor to the list of things you can pick up in legacy dungeons and raids. While there’s a surprisingly short list of adornments from the first eleven chapters of our journeys across Azeroth that are known to drop from bosses so far, it’s a safe bet that more will be added in the coming months and years. These decor items are guaranteed drops, so no tedious grinding is necessary for your first copy. Dungeons will have their last boss drop the decor item, but any boss from a raid could drop a furnishing. If you’re looking for multiple copies of any of these items, it’s a simple as running the instance again for a second or third (or 20th) copy of the item. Here is the list of decor I have on my launch day wish list. Valdrakken Hanging Lamp — After a quick run through the Ruby Life Pools, you’ll be able to hang an indoor-only glass sphere of enchanted fire from your rafters. The long rope gives this versatility, but the five colored gems really set it apart from the multitude of other lighting options. Magistrix’s Garden Fountain — Just a few bosses into The Nighthold is where you’ll encounter Spellblade Aluriel, who will now drop a stylish stone water feature each time you defeat her. You can place a large one front-and-center in your yard, but I’m excited to see what creative hijinks the community gets up to by taking advantage of this item’s ability to also be placed inside. Eye of Acherus — If you’re planning on using your home as a base for raising an army of undead and training them in the ways of the Death Knight, you’ll want one of these smoking blue orbs with its stylish skull-and-chain holder from the Pit of Saron. It’s a must-have for rooms with an Icecrown theme or as a Hallow’s End yard decoration. Tome of Pandaren Wisdom — I have already seen some amazing player-built features such as gaming tables and cozy reading nooks. This book bound in wood and red yarn found in the Temple of the Jade Serpent should give a little flair to any personal library or nightstand, and can even be placed outside for a bit of light Lorewalking in the shade. Gnomish Tesla Tower — Clearing Operation: Mechagon on any difficulty will net you this amazing electrical contraption that could be perfect for an interior workshop space or atop the pinnacle of your house as a lightning rod or weather station. This is an absolute necessity for any Gnome-themed area on your property. Crucible Votive — Here’s something perfect for setting just the right mood in your drawing room. If you’ll be running a murder mystery party, crafting an enormous pipe organ, or simply looking to furnish your dedicated brooding space, this rack of 46 candles drops from the Restless Cabal in the Crucible of Storms. Tidesage’s Fireplace — While you’re vanquishing the tentacled horrors of Stormsong Valley, you can pop over to the Shrine of the Storm and pick up this stunning full-wall masterpiece. Don’t even think about putting the finishing touches on any nautical-themed sitting parlor without this enormous green cephalopod adorning your mantle. Horde Warlord’s Throne — We’ll wrap up with a trio of Horde-themed decor for anyone looking to put an extra zug zug into their floorplan. You’ll have to get all the way through Siege of Orgrimmar to earn Garrosh Hellscream’s personal seat, but it will certainly be worth the effort to use it as a centerpiece in your great hall or to lord over your weekly lawn darts tournament. Orgrimmar Sconce — Skulloc in the Iron Docks is the source for this wall-mounted horn that holds up a flaming spiked cage on a thick metal chain. Lining a hallway or dining room with these is sure to get your name on the shortlist to be the next Chief Interior Decorator of the Horde Forces. Horde Battle Emblem — Here’s the perfect item to mount above your horned Warlord Throne. Clearing Upper Blackrock Spire will reward you with this axe/shield combo that can also be placed outside to the annoyance of your Alliance-biased HOA. Blizzard Watch is a safe space for all readers.

Title: Why Real-World Utility, Not Meme Coin Mania, Will Drive Crypto’s Next Wave

For years, crypto has resembled a casino, with flashy trends, wild price spikes and meme coins stealing the spotlight. But beneath the noise, something very different is taking shape in the middle of this so-called bear market. The next major leap in digital assets is unlikely to be fueled by the latest meme coin or a fleeting trading frenzy. Instead, it will be powered by real-world applications and the development of durable, institutional-grade infrastructure. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. As the industry evolves, a substantial shift in investment and engineering resources is underway. The focus is moving away from speculative”casino” behavior and toward more functional, enduring applications: everyday global payments, banking services built on stablecoins and the seamless integration of tokenization into traditional financial systems. This transition will mark the true maturation of the parallel financial system. A recent TRM Labs adoption report revealed that India, the United States, Pakistan, the Philippines and Brazil are now leading global digital asset usage. South Asia is also the fastest-growing crypto market in 2025. The next significant advancement in digital assets probably won’t be driven by a new meme coin or a temporary surge in trading activity. Crucially, the research shows that stablecoins accounted for approximately 30 percent of all on-chain activity, with total transaction volume rising above $4 trillion between January and July 2025, marking an 83 percent year-over-year increase. That isn’t the profile of a market anticipating the next viral trend. It’s the profile of a parallel payments and settlement layer taking shape. The last big boom was fueled by meme coins and quick-hit trading crazes. That era brought millions of newcomers into crypto, but it also cemented the perception of the industry as a digital gambling hall. Today’s landscape looks markedly different. Significant liquidity is now flowing through crypto spot ETFs. Stablecoin activity is at an all-time high. Tokenization markets are expanding. Serious capital is staying in the system, not just passing through for a quick bet. At the same time, hype-driven projects with no real utility beyond speculation are being flushed out. What’s emerging instead is infrastructure and applications designed for populations regularly excluded from traditional banking systems. One of the strongest indicators of this adoption-driven future lies in the emergence of a new class of financial institutions. For over a decade, neobanks were heralded as the future of finance, despite most remaining deeply tied to legacy rails, from know-your-customer (KYC) procedures and custody models to payment networks and physical card issuance. They did little for the 1.4 billion people who remain unbanked, and they still left users exposed to arbitrary account freezes and the same opaque systems that defined traditional banking. A new category, known as decentralized on-chain baking platforms, or deobanks, is taking the opposite approach. Instead of layering a sleek interface over incumbents, these platforms are building upward from blockchain infrastructure itself. Here, self-custodial accounts are connected through smart contracts, giving users real control over their assets, unlike the temporary permissions granted on a centralized bank ledger. These accounts also operate on stablecoin-native infrastructure, enabling cross-border transfers to settle in minutes and eliminating SWIFT fees and correspondent banking delays. Moreover, loyalty and governance are directly linked to network participation, rather than being obscured by unclear “points” programs. Critics point to new risks from key management challenges to smart contract exploits to uneven regulatory oversight. And while those concerns are valid, they also overlook that these systems offer meaningful benefits to millions who lack reliable access to savings, credit or affordable international payments. And this is where stablecoins change the story. This new infrastructure is paving the way for mainstream crypto adoption, where digital assets are used for everyday payments, not just speculative bets. As noted, stablecoin use has shot up considerably, with TRM Labs reporting that they now account for nearly one-third of all on-chain activity. Meanwhile, the regulatory landscape around them is shifting in ways that legitimize these assets. The U.S. recently enacted its first comprehensive legislation for fiat-backed tokens known as the GENIUS Act. The E.U.’s MiCA regulations are now in effect, and Hong Kong, along with other major financial hubs, has introduced dedicated frameworks for these assets. These developments are now making it possible for banks, payment processors and fintech companies to integrate with crypto infrastructure without the regulatory paralysis of prior years. They are also reshaping real-world incentives, making remittances from workers in the Gulf, Europe or North America to relatives in South Asia, Africa and Latin America, not only cheaper, but almost instant. With trillions of dollars flowing through stablecoins each year—and clear legal recognition emerging in major markets—they are becoming far more than payment novelties. Given that 90 percent of them are pegged to the U.S. dollar, these assets are now functioning as an alternative settlement layer for the dollar itself. As money increasingly flows through this system, a tipping point will arrive: an infrastructure strong enough to shape the next chapter of global finance. It’s become very difficult to believe that the next bull run will still be driven by the old question: Which coin will be 100x? Instead, it is far more likely to be driven by the networks processing the next trillion dollars in real-world payments. And because crypto is shedding its identity as a discrete asset class and becoming part of the invisible infrastructure behind everyday payment transactions, that shift may arrive sooner than expected. Two trends are powering this transition: the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and the emergence of decentralized banks. Today, roughly $35.6 billion in RWAs is tokenized, with market-maker Keyrock projecting the figure will reach $50 billion by the end of 2025. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has also outlined a plan to unlock up to $4 trillion in digital wallet-held assets around the world through the digitization of traditional financial products—a signal of how large this market may grow. Deobanks, meanwhile, bring stablecoin payments and self-custody to the mainstream while layering in credit, savings and rewards. They allow users to bypass legacy intermediaries and plug directly into blockchain settlement rails. In such an ecosystem, liquidity can no longer depend on speculative waves. It will come from continuous flows: remittances, payroll, supplier payments, trade finance and tokenized fixed-income products. At that point, market cycles will sit on top of a growing base of structural demand, not narrative-driven inflows. Ultimately, it is this structural foundation that will determine how far any future bull market can run. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Following the launch of Gemini 3 with advanced capabilities across video, reasoning, and coding, Google is now the talk of the town in the generative AI category. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently admitted that the Gemini team had done a great job with the launch. Even NVIDIA, which has also been flying high due to the high demand for chips to foster AI advances (unlocking $4 trillion in market capitalization), recently indicated that it is delighted by Google's success (via Tom's Hardware). But perhaps more interestingly, the chipmaker used the opportunity to toot its own horn: "Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done. Nvidia offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions." This news comes after reports claim that Meta is currently in discussions with Google to rent its Cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in 2026, and even potentially buy them in the subsequent year. Consequently, Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Meta's stock prices saw a significant increase. However, NVIDIA's stock price dropped by 3%.

For context, the former's offerings are designed to help with AI model training and inference, while the latter are designed for parallel processing, allowing them to handle billions of calculations simultaneously. While speaking to CNBC, a Google spokesman indicated: “We are experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and Nvidia GPUs. We are committed to supporting both, as we have for years.” During NVIDIA's earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang addressed the rising TPU competition, indicating that Google is the company's customer for GPU chips and that Gemini can run on its technology.

OLED tech means these elite TVs offer incredible contrast and no light bleed. Here are our top picks When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The best OLED TVs on the market today deliver beautiful image quality thanks to the self-lighting pixels that define this technology. What these pixels deliver are stunningly deep black tones and incredibly precise contrast between light and dark areas, in a way that LED or mini-LED TVs simply cannot match. Read our 'What is OLED?' guide for more on why this tech is such a big upgrade, and so sought-after. The best OLED TVs include a lot of models that rank among the best TVs overall, and come from the biggest TV brands, such as LG and Sony. Even Samsung – a TV company that had rejected OLED for years, has not only joined the party, but has topped our rankings here at times. Our picks of the best OLED TVs here aren't just ranked from the best-looking to the weakest, because that would put all the most expensive ones at the top. We've tried to be more discerning and helpful, choosing the best options for different price brackets and particular needs, hopefully making it easier to find the one that fits your need best. ⭣ Read more Why you can trust TechRadar's choices We've tested all the TVs here ourselves, and our TV review team is led by Al Griffin, an ISF-trained video calibrator with nearly three decades of AV journalism experience. He's trained our staff writers to balance objective testing of brightness and color accuracy (measured using high-end industry-standard equipment) with the more subjective elements of picture and sound quality – because you can't judge how an image looks to the eye based on scientific measurements alone. We're judging these TVs based not just on picture quality, but also the features they offer, and how that balances with the price. We provide ratings for each TV in the different sections we judge, as well as providing our measurements, so you can follow our decision making, and decide if your own priorities are slightly different. Each TV is vouched for by a member of the team, who's written up why they recommended it, as well as going in-depth on what we thought based on our review. Best overall The best OLED TV for most people This feature-packed OLED TV delivers stunning picture quality, excellent performance and a brightness boost over the C4, all at a competitive price. It’s an excellent value all-rounder, available in a wide range of sizes too.

Read more below October 24, 2025Replaced the LG C4 with the newer LG C5 as our 'best for most people' pick, based on our recent testing. Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test. Our expert review: 1-minute summary: The LG C5 OLED TV continues the tradition of affordable, mid-range greatness exemplified by its C4 predecessor, now taking its place as our best OLED TV for most people. While picture quality between the two is largely similar, a new Alpha 9 Gen 8 AI Processor here delivers a modest brightness boost, along with AI-driven picture and sound enhancements. Available in a wide range of sizes from 42 to 83 inches, the C5 suits everything from desktop gaming to your home theater. It’s a fantastic choice for gamers with a full suite of essential features, including 4K 144Hz, VRR, FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync, ALLM and Dolby Vision gaming, all across four HDMI ports. The updated webOS smart TV platform uses AI to enhance search and both picture and sound customization, and it can be personalized for multiple users in the same household, using voice recognition to switch between them. Whether it’s for gaming, movies, or everyday viewing, the LG C5 is a superb all-purpose TV that offers excellent performance and value. Read our full LG C5 review ✅ You value versatility in an OLED TV: With picture quality that looks more premium than its price, excellent gaming features and a wide range of sizes, the C5 ticks all the boxes. ✅ You want an intuitive smart TV platform: webOS 25 is clean, responsive and easy to navigate with new AI tools that make setup, search and customization smarter than ever. ✅ You want a great gaming TV: With a full suite of gaming features, impressive performance and stunning visuals, the C5 is a perfect TV for gaming. ❌ You already own the LG C4: The LG C5 is excellent, but its upgrades are modest. Or at least not enough to justify replacing last year’s model if that’s what you have. ❌ You want the best built-in sound: Audio performance is decent, but it doesn’t match the C5’s stellar picture quality, and some rivals do sound better straight out of the box. ❌ You need HDR10+ support: The C5 supports Dolby Vision but skips HDR10+, which is becoming a more widely used HDR format on major streaming platforms. We measured the LG C5’s peak HDR brightness at 1,180 nits in Filmmaker Mode, which is a solid step up from the C4’s 1,065 nits. That extra brightness brings more punch to HDR highlights and adds realism to colors, which look rich and dynamic across Dolby Vision content. Shadow detail and contrast remain superb, with deep blacks and refined mid-tones in darker scenes. Upscaling is also impressive, giving HD and even standard definition sources a sharper, cleaner look. The only thing the C5 struggled a little with was screen reflections, especially when you’re watching in brighter rooms. The LG C5 uses a 2.2-channel, 40W Dolby Atmos speaker system with no DTS support. Its updated AI Sound Pro mode can upmix audio to a virtual 11.1.2 setup, creating a wider and more immersive soundstage than the C4. During testing, we particularly enjoyed using the TV’s AI Sound Pro mode, which enhanced every aspect of the audio, producing a brighter overall sound that may not suit everyone but we found it more engaging and immersive. The new AI Sound Wizard allows for personalized audio profiles, offering welcome customization even if some of the profiles didn’t quite hit the mark. Overall, sound quality is good, but pairing the C5 with one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars is the ideal way to match its excellent picture performance. The LG C5 runs on webOS 25, which builds on its predecessor with a host of new AI tools, including AI Search, AI Concierge and AI Art. The upgraded Chatbot can now offer quick advice on picture or sound settings, though it struggles with more complex questions. Voice ID is a standout new addition, automatically recognizing who’s speaking and then switching to their personalized profile and recommendations. Quick Cards remain a handy way to organize apps by category, while the layout of webOS 25 is clean and easy to navigate. The Quick Menu is still a strong feature, letting you tweak settings on the fly without interrupting what you’re watching. The LG C5 is a great choice if you want a gaming TV with full support for 4K 144Hz, VRR (AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync), HGiG, Dolby Vision gaming and ALLM across its four HDMI 2.1 ports. Its Game Optimizer mode lets you fine-tune settings, while the Game Quick Card provides access to cloud gaming services, like Amazon Luna and Nvidia GeForce Now. Input lag measures an impressively low 9.2ms, and gameplay feels smooth and responsive with no tearing and blurring. Combined with the C5’s vibrant picture quality and deep contrast, it’s one of the best OLED TVs you can buy for gaming. The LG C5 is a feature-packed OLED TV that offers premium performance at a mid-range price, making it one of the best all-round options for most people for movies and gaming. However, at launch, the 65-inch model costs $2,699.99 / £2,699.99. While the C4, which is still available, can now be found for $1,499.99 / £1,499.99, which is a big difference given how similar the two sets are. Yes, the C5 adds the brightness boost and new AI features, but it isn’t a major leap forward. Having said that, prices are likely to fall, and once the C4 disappears, the C5 will become even more of a clear go-to OLED. Our expert review: 1 minute summary: If you're looking for a cheaper way to get a 2024 OLED TV, then the LG B4 is for you. Although it's price isn't much less than the step-up LG C4, it's still cheaper, with further discounts likely to come. The B4 may be the entry-level OLED in LG's 2024 lineup, but I feel it outperforms its price, delivering a rich, colorful, accurate picture with plenty of detail. When I tested the B4, it proved to be a fantastic performer for movies, but also an accomplished gaming TV, with its four HDMI 2.1 ports supporting many features found in the best gaming TVs such as 4K, 144Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, VRR and more. I found its during testing that its sound isn't the strongest, with limited bass and average virtual surround reproduction, and its picture brightness pales compared to more premium OLED TVs, but the B4 is still an excellent entry-level set. ✅ You want an OLED on a budget: The B4 is cheaper than any other 2024 OLED TV on the market and mostly covers all the bases. ✅ You want a cheaper OLED for gaming: The B4 is an excellent gaming TV, with four HMDI 2.1 ports supporting 4K, 144Hz, VRR and more. ✅ You want a detailed picture: The LG B4's crisp detail, rich contrast and bold colors suggest a more premium OLED. ❌ You want great sound: The B4's built-in sound doesn't match the quality of its picture, with limited bass and Dolby Atmos effects. ❌ You want the brightest OLED: Compared with step-up OLED models, the B4's brightness is average, peaking at 656 nits. ❌ You need full HDR support: The B4 supports Dolby Vision HDR, but not HDR10+. The B4's picture impressed during our testing, with its deep black levels, strong contrast and vibrant colors in particular standing out. In our review, we praised the B4's "exceptional shadow detail" and its Dolby Vision Filmmaker Mode, which provided an accurate picture with ease. We did find that its lower brightness made its picture less dynamic than what you'll find in step-up OLEDs such as the LG C4, but the B4's picture is still very good, especially for an OLED at this price. The B4's sound is average and while it does the job, it won't beat TVs like the Sony Bravia 8 anytime soon. While it delivers clear dialogue and has a good balance, its bass is limited and virtual surround sound effects lack impact. At higher volumes, it can even sound "thin and edgy" as we said in our review. For casual viewing, the B4's sound will most likely be fine, but if you're looking for a more cinematic experience, you'll want to add a soundbar. The B4 uses LG's own smart TV platform, webOS, and it's easily one of the best smart interfaces on the market. Quick Cards organize apps into easy to navigate categories and a Quick Menu, which we praised in our review, means useful settings can be adjusted easily without moving away from what's on screen. There is a large banner ad at the top of the home page, but this is becoming commonplace on smart TV platforms and is really the only criticism we have of the user-friendly webOS. With four HDMI 2.1 ports supporting 4K 144Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, VRR (including AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia GSync), HGiG, ALLM and Dolby Vision gaming, the B4 has things more than covered when it comes to gaming. Its Game Optimizer is a useful feature that allows for easy adjustments to gaming settings and there's also cloud gaming app support. A 9.1ms input lag time (with Boost Mode activated) means the B4 delivers exceptional gaming performance and combined with the features listed above, the B4 comes out as a superb gaming OLED with a cheaper price tag. The 65-inch B4 costs roughly $1,499 / £1,699 / AU$2,795. When compared to the $1,599/ £1,899 / AU$3,495 you'll pay for the LG C4, which provides higher brightness and a performance boost thanks to a faster processor, the B4 doesn't offer the greatest value overall. Still, it is a well-featured and high quality OLED TV that more than justifies its price. Our expert review: 1-minute summary: The LG G5 is the company's flagship OLED for 2025, and when I tested it, with its next-gen OLED panel, I could barely have been more impressed. Not only does this new panel bring spectacular color and contrast, but high brightness levels I didn't though would be possible on OLED a few years ago. Not only does it bring incredible picture quality, but it also comes loaded with the full suite of features I've come to expect from LG's OLEDs in both gaming and smart-based applications. I also found that the new AI-based tools in LG's latest smart TV platform, webOS 25, should give some users real help when navigating their new OLED TV. While it may be a pricier option than its step-down counterpart, the LG C5, I said in my review it still serves as "a best-in-class OLED TV option for 2025". It's easily the premium OLED to beat this year. Read our full LG G5 review ✅ You want an OLED fit for all rooms: With higher fullscreen brightness levels and a new Filmmaker Ambient Light Mode, the G5 is ideal for all viewing situations. ✅ You want a TV for wall-mounting: With a slim-fit, wall-hugging design, the G5 will look perfect on your wall. ✅ You want a premium OLED for gaming: 4K, 165Hz, AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync and a low 9.1ms input lag make the G5 one of the best gaming TVs around. ❌ You want HDR10+ support: While it supports Dolby Vision, the G5 does not support HDR10+, which is used on some 4K Blu-rays and streaming services. ❌ You don't want to use a soundbar: The G5's built-in speakers are more than adequate, but don't match the level of its picture quality. It deserves a soundbar or speaker system. ❌ You want to save money: The step-down LG C5 doesn't deliver the same brightness or color depth, but it's significantly cheaper while delivering basically the same features. The LG G5 introduces a new OLED panel called Primary Tandem RGB or 'four-stack', that delivers incredible brightness and amazing color and contrast. Now holding the distinction of the brightest OLED we've tested so far (it hit 2,268 nits in Filmmaker Mode), the G5 is superb in all viewing conditions with no need to adjust lighting. As we pointed out in our review "contrast, color saturation, and shadow detail all held up nicely even with my room’s overhead lighting on". A new Filmmaker Ambient Light Mode also effectively adjust gamma to suit your room's lighting conditions, meaning you never need to alter your settings. It also delivers fantastic motion for both sports and movies. The G5's built-in 4.2 channel speaker system delivers clear speech and effective positioning of spatial sound effects, especially when using the AI Sound Pro mode. A new Sound wizard also allows you to create your own sound profile (in a similar vein to the TV's picture Wizard) which could be useful for some users. While the G5's sound is perfectly good, it deserves a robust Dolby Atmos soundbar to match its picture prowess. Already one of the best smart TV platforms on offer, webOS 25 introduces new AI-based tools such as AI Search and AI Concierge that make browsing for and finding recommended movies and TV shows a breeze. Its Quick Card and Quick Menu remain useful staples of the webOS interface that make navigation user-friendly and easy. Plus, it runs smoothly with fast, lag-free performance. As we said in our review "LG TVs have fantastic gaming credentials" and the G5 is no different. Four HDMI 2.1 ports all support 4K, 165Hz, VRR (AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync), HGiG and Dolby Vision gaming, plus it boasts an ultra-low 9.1 ms input lag time when Boost mode in the Game Optimizer menu is activated. Its Game Quick Card also has access to a wealth of cloud based gaming portals such as Luna and Nvidia GeForce Now. When it comes to gaming TVs, it doesn't get better than the G5. The G5 is a premium priced TV, but it delivers premium features and performance. That being said, the step-down LG C5 delivers a lot similar features and excellent performance for a lower cost and the G5 is priced higher than some of its rivals, including the Samsung S95F at launch. Still, given what the G5 does deliver, its pricing isn't surprising or unfair. Our expert review: 1-minute summary: Panasonic’s new flagship OLED, the Z95B, is a worthy successor to last year’s Z95A. It introduces a new Primary RGB Tandem panel that pushes brightness while delivering richer, more natural color detail. In our testing, it hit an impressive 2,107 nits. But Panasonic has made a commitment to accuracy over brightness. The result is that movies look refined, subtle and true-to-life, rather than simply boosted. But the real story here is sound. The Z95B takes a big step forward with audio. Its 360 Soundscape Pro system, tuned by Technics, has been upgraded with new drivers and a refined speaker layout. The result is one of the best built-in sound systems you’ll find on any TV. It’s powerful, immersive and clear enough that you can even comfortably skip buying a soundbar. That alone gives the Z95B excellent value compared to its OLED rivals. Read our full Panasonic Z95B review ✅ You want the ultimate movie night TV: The Z95B’s sharp, colorful and accurate picture makes Blu-rays and streaming films look incredible. ✅ You don’t want to clutter your living room with a soundbar: Its built-in 5.1.2-channel speaker system delivers big, immersive sound that’s good enough to stand on its own. ❌ You prefer watching with the lights on: The picture is good in all scenarios, but it's at its best in dim rooms, and the anti-glare screen isn’t the strongest for bright, sunlit spaces. ❌ You dislike fiddling with settings: This TV has a long list of advanced picture and sound options, and while you can ignore them, some fine-tuning helps unlock its best performance. Panasonic has introduced a new 'four-stack' OLED panel design in the Z95B, with separate red and green layers sandwiched between dual blue layers. This allows for a much brighter image than past models while keeping color richness intact. Our tests measured peak HDR brightness at 2,107 nits – impressive by OLED standards. But unlike rivals chasing sheer brightness, Panasonic’s focus here is accuracy. The Z95B delivers a natural, finely balanced image with subtle gradations and detail. Skin tones and textures look especially lifelike. There’s also an advanced cooling system to help the panel maintain peak brightness during demanding HDR scenes. In its most accurate presets (Filmmaker Mode, True Cinema, Cinema), it doesn’t reach the same dazzling brightness as some competitors. But what you gain is a consistent, refined picture. The Z95B retains the 5.1.2-channel 360 Soundscape Pro speaker system from the Z95A, but Panasonic has improved the driver quality and tweaked the layout too. The result is even better, spacious, powerful and immersive sound. In fact, we’d call this one of the best built-in TV sound systems available today. Dialogue is clear, effects have impact and there’s enough scale to rival mid-range soundbars. A handy “Sound Focus” feature ensures dialogue stays sharp even when you’re sitting off to the side. We rarely say this, but the Z95B is strong enough sonically that you could skip an external soundbar and still feel very satisfied. That makes it exceptional value in the premium TV market. The Z95B runs Amazon’s Fire TV platform. While it isn’t the slickest or most elegant interface in our opinion, it’s reliable, offers a wide spread of apps and integrates well with Alexa and Prime Video. Navigation is quick, and performance felt solid across apps and menus. It’s not our favorite smart platform compared to LG’s webOS or Samsung’s Tizen, but it covers the essentials well and many will appreciate its familiarity. Gamers also benefit from Fire TV’s support for cloud gaming apps. The Z95B is well-equipped for gaming. There’s support for 4K at 144Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, and VRR, including AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync. Input lag is low, and the picture retains the same accuracy advantages seen in movies. The main limitation is connectivity. With only two HDMI 2.1 ports, rather than the four found on some competitors, you’ll need to prioritize which devices get full-featured connections. But the Z95B’s strong built-in sound system reduces the need for a soundbar, making this compromise less restrictive than usual. Panasonic OLED TVs are usually priced higher than the competition, but the Z95B launched at the same level as key rivals. Add in the fact that discounts are already appearing and this flagship is looking like excellent value. Factor in the built-in 5.1.2-channel audio, which genuinely removes the need for a separate soundbar, and the Z95B stands out as one of the smartest buys in the premium OLED space right now. Our expert review: 1-minute summary: The Samsung S95F has the reflection-beating matte screen of its predecessor, the S95D, but improves on it by maintaining more accurate black levels even in bright conditions. It also delivers spectacular colors and realistic textures. The S95F is a gamer's dream, with 4K 165Hz, VRR (AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync), ALLM and HDR10+ gaming support across four HDMI 2.1 ports and is a good-looking TV, with a razor-thin profile. While its sound could be better and there is still some black crush in darker scenes, the S95F is still undeniably one of 2025's best TVs. Read our full Samsung S95F review ✅ You want an OLED fit for all rooms: With OLED Glare Free anti-reflection tech, the S95F's impeccable picture can be viewed in the brightest of rooms. ✅ You want the QD-OLED experience: Contrast, brightness and color are all fantastic on the S95F, proving the advantages of its QD-OLED display panel. ✅ You want an OLED that looks premium: A trim profile, razor-thin depth, and an external connections box to keep things neat make the S95F one of the best-looking TVs around. ❌ You want full HDR support: Despite covering nearly all the bases, the S95D does not support Dolby Vision HDR. ❌ You want the absolute best black levels: The S95F's anti-reflection screen is useful, but it does compromise on black levels, which look raised compared to the competition. ❌ You're on a budget: Elite performance does come with an elite price tag, and the S95F sits near the top end of the OLED market. I described the S95F as " a sight to behold even compared to the best OLED TVS" in my review, thanks to its stunning brightness levels, gorgeous, vibrant colors and solid contrast. The real star of the show is its OLED Glare Free 2.0 screen, which eliminates pesky mirror-like reflections even in the brightest of rooms. Its motion handling is also responsive with a bit of tweaking, making it great for viewing sports. While there are instances of black crush, the S95F's picture is staggeringly good and it's easily one of the best I've seen in 2025. Tizen has never been the best smart TV platform, but Tizen 9.0, the 2025 version, is the best one yet. With a useful quick menu, access to every major app and hubs for app organisation – Game, Home, Daily+ and Ambient – Tizen is now in a better place. Yes, some settings are still buried in deep menus and are a pain to access, but that is my only real gripe with this now-great smart TV system. The S95F's built-in sound delivers punchy bass, effective placement and tracking of sound thanks to Samsung's Object Tracking Sound+ feature, and speech is clear throughout. Where the S95F comes up short is in its narrow-feeling soundstage, which isn't as immersive as the sound on TVs from the likes of Sony and Panasonic. Some people will be pleased with the S95F's sound, but others may want a soundbar for a more cinematic experience. Gaming is another area where the S95F shines. It's packed with gaming features, including 4K 165Hz, VRR with AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync, ALLM and HDR10+ gaming, along with four HDMI 2.1 ports. It also delivers an ultra-low 9.5ms input lag time as well as Samsung's Gaming Hub with cloud gaming options for those without a console. Picture-wise, the S95F benefits any game played on it. The S95F is a phenomenal gaming TV that gamers will love. As always, judging a flagship OLED's value is tough. While the S95F more than delivers for the money with its features, picture quality and premium design, its price tag ($2,499 / £2,499 for the 55-inch model I tested) will outstretch most budgets. The S95F is an elite TV after all, so its hefty price tag is to be expected. • Most OLED TVs are premium: 4K, 120Hz, with four HDMI ports • Brightness varies greatly and some have more HDMI 2.1 ports for gaming • Samsung OLED TVs use HDR10+, most other OLED TVs have Dolby Vision OLED TVs tend to be premium TVs, which means you're getting a certain level of features in almost all of them – they're all 4K, they're mostly 120Hz for gaming, for example, and they tend to all have four HDMI ports, and premium smart TV software. But they're absolutely not all the same. Some are much brighter than others (around twice as bright, in some cases), some have more HDMI 2.1 ports for next-gen gaming, some have better sound systems, and they don't all come in the same size options. It's important to consider what size TV is best for you, and to do that you'll literally need to measure the space you have to work with. Remember a TV that fills every available scrap of space in your living room might sound like a great idea, but you'll need to consider viewing angles, screen brightness and whether you'll be able to sit a decent distance from the TV to fully appreciate it. The LG C4 has the widest range of sizes of any TV we feature, so if you need something smaller, that's a great place to start. When it comes to HDR support, we recommend mostly that people choose TVs with Dolby Vision, because it's the most commonly used advanced HDR format on the best streaming services. Samsung TVs only use HDR10+, which is similar technology, but not as well supported. It's not a dealbreaker that Samsung's TVs don't support Dolby Vision, but as you'll see in our list, we prefer sets that include it. At the start of the year, at the big CES 2025 technology show, we got our first look at the new OLED TVs coming during 2025. LG has released the LG G5, which has taken a top-level spot on this list as our choice for 'Best premium OLED.' We've also reviewed the mid-range LG C5 OLED, though the LG C4 remains our pick as the 'Best for most people' due to its ongoing availability and excellent value. The LG B5 budget TV should comes a little later, though this year the B5 is only coming in two sizes, sadly. The Samsung S95F and has since been added to this list as the best OLED for bright rooms . This TV also comes in an 83-inch model for the first time – though that size will use a new-gen W-OLED panel (the same as the LG G5) instead of the QD-OLED panel used for the 55-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch sizes. Samsung also announced the S90F mid-range OLED TV, in sizes from 42 inches to 83 inches. Finally Samsung will have a cheaper S85F OLED TV option, which is expected to be less bright. Sansui has announced that it will have a budget range of OLED TVs from 55 to 77 inches in the US, which we expect will start from about $800 based on last year's models – that's massively cheaper than the equivalent from LG. Panasonic announced that it will launch a new range of OLEDs, led by the flagship Panasonic Z95B, a model that has since been added to this list as the best for sound option Hisense will have some OLED TV options in some countries, but we're waiting on confirmation of what those TVs will be in terms of size and specs. Sony released the new Sony Bravia 8 II OLED, and Philips will likely announce new OLED TVs for the UK and Europe, also closer to spring. • Entry-level OLED TVs tend to cost from $1,000 / £900 / AU$1,500 • You'll pay twice as much for mid-tier OLED TVs and triple for high-end sets • Sales events like Black Friday and Prime Day are a great time to buy an OLED TV The cost of OLED TVs varies hugely depending on what technologies are thrown in with an OLED panel, such as the resolution, processor, build quality, built-in speakers, and more. But suffice to say that entry-level models sit around (or, more recently, just under) the $1,000 / £900 / AU$1,500 mark. More mid-tier OLEDs at larger sizes (65 inches and above) can double that figure, or triple it when you're looking at the cutting-edge high-end panels. You might also notice that you don't get that much of a lower price with the smaller 42-inch sizes of OLED TV – that's because making them so small relies on relatively new tech, so they're not quite such good value per inch. Sales periods such as Prime Day or Black Friday tend to include lots of discounts on OLED TV models, though – especially from LG and Samsung. • Samsung TVs often use its competing QLED tech rather than OLED • QLED generally has better brightness than OLED • Mini LED TVs have OLED-rivalling or beating contrast OLED isn't the only option for savvy TV buyers. Samsung's competing QLED televisions outperform for brightness, while the introduction of Mini LED backlights has only improved peak light output and overall contrast – the areas that OLED generally has the upper hand with, thanks to its per-pixel brightness control. It's a tighter race than ever, then, though it's worth assessing secondary characteristics for OLED and QLED screens. An OLED with a cheap processor may cause more artefacts and video noise, while a QLED with edge-lighting won't get the true benefit of its enhanced color and contrast. Format or feature support can be crucial if you're hooking up your TV to a PC, a games console, or a 4K Blu-ray player too. According to LG Display, the makers of the OLED panels that go into every OLED TV on the list - around 100,000 hours. For most folks that's about 10 years of TV watching and far exceeds the 40,000 to 60,000-hour lifespans of most LED-LCD TVs. That said, OLED TVs can experience something called burn-in when a static image is left on the screen for prolonged periods of time - so be sure to change the channel every few days. OLED is, for many, the premium TV tech of the moment. Though once weighed down by inaccessible price points, a flurry of cheaper mid-range OLEDs and smaller panel sizes has helped bring OLED closer to the mass market. Samsung and Sony's current TV lineups include QD-OLED hybrids (they combine OLED panels with quantum dot tech, utilising the self-emissive properties of the former and color enhancements of the latter) – we have a separate guide to whether you should buy a Samsung OLED TV, if you want to read more about them. For those with cash to splash, you'll be choosing between a high-end OLED TV and Micro LED – a self-emissive panel technology that Samsung has leant into in recent times, but which has proved difficult to offer either affordably or at mainstream sizing (88-inch is the smallest we've heard about so far, as of 2024). It's a more complicated picture than simply OLED, then, though for deep blacks and true-to-life color – at a size you can actually get into the average living room – OLED may still be the best choice. • Burn-in has traditionally been a problem on OLED TVs • Most OLED TVs now have ways to prevent burn-in, including Auto Brightness Limiting (ABL) • These days, burn-in is not a big problem or something to worry about Burn-in, also known as screen burn or permanent image retention, is a visual artefact that sometimes appears when a TV has shown the same thing in the same place for a long time. It definitely happens on some OLED TVs, but manufacturers have come up with lots of ways to minimise the likelihood of it happening to yours. There are three main ways in which OLED TVs can minimise the likelihood of burn-in. They can use image analysis to identify static images – TV channel logos, for example – and subtly dim them. They can gently shift the image around by a few pixels, something that your OLED probably does already without you noticing it. And there's a more brute-force approach, where the TV automatically dulls the brightness of the whole display when it detects a bright and potentially burn-in item. That latter one is the least popular because if it isn't implemented well it can be quite dramatic and quite annoying. More modern TVs with this tech, known as ABL (Auto Brightness Limiting) are much more subtle about it than older ones. Last but not least, you can take the DIY route. The default modes such as Vivid Mode on some TVs can be ridiculously bright, so changing them or using less blazing settings will make your eyes happy and reduce the risk of burn-in even further. Ultimately burn-in is all about heat, hence the name. And the best way to reduce the risk of it and perhaps eliminate it altogether is to manage heat better in OLED TVs. And manufactures are doing just that. You'll find clever heatsink technology and heat dissipation design in OLEDs from Panasonic, LG, Sony and more. We're not saying burn-in doesn't exist. It does. But the advances in OLED TV tech in recent years means it's much less of an issue than it was in early OLEDs, and for most of us it's something we don't really need to worry about too much. • OLED TVs usually have a fast 120Hz or 144Hz refresh rate, which is great for gaming • The Xbox Series X's Dolby Vision format won't work with Samsung TVs • Look for HDMI 2.1 ports – ideally four – for ultimate gaming performance Arguably, all OLED TVs are ideal for gaming as they typically have a fast, 120Hz or higher refresh rate and pixel-level brightness control that helps fast-motion images look solid. Even so, there are differences between the various OLED TVs in this guide that can make them better suited for different gaming scenarios. High dynamic range support varies among the different TV brands, and that can have an impact on gaming. Samsung TVs, for instance, support the HDR10+ format, but not Dolby Vision. So, if you’re using an Xbox Series X console, you won’t be able to take advantage of its Dolby Vision gaming capabilities when playing on a Samsung TV. LG TVs, in contrast, do have Dolby Vision HDR support, but not the competing HDR10+ format. That’s not as much as an issue for gaming, however, as the availability of games with HDR10+ is very limited compared to Dolby Vision. Panasonic TVs support both the Dolby Vision and HDR10+ formats. If you’re looking for a maximum 4K 144Hz refresh rate for PC gaming, you’ll find broad support for that feature among the TVs in this guide. In fact, the only TV that doesn’t offer 4K 144Hz support is the LG B4, which maxes out at 4K 120Hz. The Samsung and LG TVs in this guide each provide four HDMI 2.1 ports with 4K 120Hz pass-through. Having four HDMI ports on a TV used for gaming is important because it allows you to connect both PS5 and Xbox One X gaming consoles and take advantage of their high refresh rate capability while also connecting a soundbar to the TV. Like many other TVs, the Panasonic TV in our guide maxes out at two HDMI 2.1 ports. That’s not so much of an issue in this case, however, since the Panasonic’s excellent built-in speaker system is powerful enough that you don’t necessarily need a soundbar. • Brightness used to be a problem for OLED TVs • New tech such as QD-OLED and Micro Lens Array has vastly improved brightness • Some of the latest sets also have anti-glare screen coatings OLED TVs in the past lagged behind QLED TVs with regular LED and mini-LED backlights when it came to brightness. The most recent crop of high-end OLED TVs has changed the game, however, by using new technologies such as QD-OLED (a Samsung-developed tech that combines an OLED display panel with quantum dots which is used in specific Samsung and Sony OLED TVs) and Micro Lens Array (an LG-developed tech combining a layer of microscopic lens elements with an OLED panel that’s used on specific OLED TVs from LG and other brands, including Panasonic). LG has also introduced the Primary Tandem RGB (four-stack) panel to the mix, adding even more brightness and more accurate black levels and color to deliver brightness like we've never seen in an OLED before. These new technologies have now made OLED competitive on the brightness front, with new models such as the Samsung S95D, LG G5 and even the LG G4 delivering peak brightness levels that even exceed some mini-LED TVs, which are typically the brightness champs. The LG G5 and G4 and especially the Samsung S95D also use anti-glare screen coatings, which, combined with the TV’s high brightness levels, make them a reasonable option for viewing in well-lit living rooms. • We run a suite of subjective and objective tests when reviewing TVs • We use specialized equipment such as colorimeters and test pattern generators • We test gaming features, upscaling, viewing angles and use different AV sources When testing the best OLED TVs, we use the same criteria that we consider in all of our TV reviews, which focuses on picture quality, audio quality, smart TV platform, design, gaming features and value for money. Our testing is not only made up of subjective opinions about each of criteria, but also on objective measurements taken using specialized equipment – you can read our full guide to how we test TVs at TechRadar, or read on for a summary. Using different AV sources, including broadcast, streaming and Blu-ray, we’ll run in every TV whilst cycling through its picture preset modes, such as Sport, Movie and Standard, to determine which settings are the most accurate for different types of media. We do this to determine what the best settings are for watching movies and TV shows or a sports match for example. Once we have established which picture modes are best suited for different types of content, we then analyze aspects of the display such as its colors, contrast, black levels and more using reference scenes we have specifically chosen to best evaluate these. When testing an OLED’s picture quality, we’re looking for deep black levels and contrast, which should be better than many other TVs on the market thanks to the screen’s ability to dim individual pixels over local dimming found in LCD TVs – often this is determined by zones and the backlight’s ability. We’ll also look at the color’s vibrancy and punchiness compared to textures and details, particularly sharpness and true-to-life accuracy. Using lower-resolution sources such as broadcast and DVD, we’ll also test a TV’s upscaling, looking to see how effectively that TV’s processing can enhance lower-res images to be displayed on a larger, 4K screen. During these tests, we also consider the viewing angle from off-center seats, which – again with the OLED panel’s ability to self-dim – should maintain strong contrast levels and picture quality even from the most awkward of viewing positions. After these subjective tests, we then take specialized equipment — a colorimeter, test pattern generator and Portrait Displays’ Calman calibration software – to perform objective tests and record the results, taking measurements of brightness, color and grayscale accuracy, gamut and more. The first test we usually do is of the TV’s brightness. Using different sized white window patterns, we measure the the TV’s peak brightness on windows including 10%, which will show the maximum brightness we can expect from the TV itself, and 100% to test full screen brightness, which will demonstrate how the TV can handle consistent levels of brightness across the whole screen (this is key when viewing sports). Full screen brightness also gives an idea of how well a TV will manage reflections. OLED TVs have often been known to offer lower levels of brightness when compared to QLED and mini-LED. But in recent years, the introduction of OLED EX panels and micro-lens-array (MLA) tech means we expect higher peak brightness levels, but still lower full screen brightness when compared to other LCD panels. We use light controlled environments when testing brightness to make sure any other light sources, environmental or otherwise, does not affect results. We also test color color reproduction in both SDR and HDR to compare its accuracy when displaying different source materials and the maximum color gamut it can show on screen. We do the same for grayscale as well, testing just how accurately a TV displays gray tones from black to white. With OLED TVs, we expect color accuracy to be among the best in the TV market, along with grayscale. Gaming is another important aspect of TVs nowadays, so we make sure to test a TV’s gaming performance by analyzing response time, graphics and latency — all of which are areas OLED TVs often excel at. We also look out for features such as a Game Mode (for adjusting a TV’s settings to the most optimum for gaming), 4K 120Hz, VRR and more. We measure response time by using a Leo Bodnar 4K HDMI input lag tester to see what latency is added by a TV’s processing. We always aim to keep our testing as consistent as possible, but it’s important to note that some of our writers’ setups and testing environments do vary. We do, however, make sure that all tests conducted use the same criteria between all of our writers, also making sure that the equipment is similar enough to achieve the same level of accuracy. The Samsung S90F series OLED TV received a five-star rating in our Samsung S90F review, but isn’t included in this guide. The main reason for this is that the 65-inch model Samsung sent us for review features a QD-OLED display panel, while other screen sizes in the S90F series are subject to a ‘panel lottery’ where either a QD-OLED or a regular W-OLED display panel may be used in the TV. This means that our Samsung S90F ratings apply to the 65-inch model and don’t necessarily extend to other screen sizes in the S90F series. Our review praised the S90F for its impressive brightness, richer color than its Samsung S90D predecessor, and its crisp 4K upscaling of HD sources. The only areas where we found its picture lacking were a tendency to crush shadow detail in some presets, and a slight gray cast to blacks when watched in rooms with bright ambient lighting – a limitation you won’t find on OLED TVs with higher peak light output, such as the LG G5 (included in this guide as 'The best premium OLED.' Otherwise, S90F series TVs are an excellent option for gaming, with 4K 144Hz support across all four HDMI 2.1 ports, AMD Freesync Premium Pro format and Nvidia G-Sync, Samsung’s Gaming Hub for cloud-based gaming, and an ultra-low 9.2ms measured input lag. The 65S90F model we tested is also a great value for a QD-OLED TV, coming in around £700 / $800 cheaper than the 65-inch version of Samsung’s S95F flagship OLED for 2025. LG G4: One of LG's flagship OLEDs for 2024, the LG G4 delivers superb picture quality and comes with all the features you'd need; both gaming and smart. It earned five out of five stars in our LG G4 review as it really is the complete package. It's not on our list as it's been replaced by its successor, the LG G5, which delivers everything the G4 does but with added brightness and even better picture quality. Don't get us wrong; the G4 is still a fantastic TV and if you can get a good deal on it, it's absolutely worth the investment! LG C5: The successor to the #1 TV in this guide, the LG C4, the LG C5 continues the LG C-series legacy of delivering arguably the best picture, features and performance for its competitive price in the mid-range OLED market. Earning five out of five stars in our LG C5 review, the only reason it's not on this list is because the C4 is still available for far lower prices. The C5 isn't enough of an upgrade to warrant knocking off the C4 yet, but once the C4 is no longer available, the C5 is likely to take its place. Sony Bravia 8: Sony's only 2024 OLED TV, the Bravia 8 impressed us during testing with its lifelike details and vivid colors, thanks to a brightness boost over its predecessor, the Sony A80L, that make HDR images pop. It's also a solid gaming TV with 'perfect for PS5' features and it has brilliant built-in sound. While it's a great TV, it doesn't hit the right price point like the LG C4, but if you want a more mid-range option with sound good enough to not need a soundbar, it's a very strong option, as our full Sony Bravia 8 review really digs into. Panasonic Z85A: A mid-range OLED TV, the Panasonic Z85A still showcases the superb picture quality we've come to know from Panasonic's OLEDs. Plus, it delivers a good array of gaming features and solid built-in sound. Unfortunately, it has to contend with a crowded mid-range OLED TV market that's dominated by the LG C4, which offers a lot of the same plus points of the Z85A at a much cheaper price, though otherwise our Panasonic Z85A review is pretty glowing. Philips OLED809: It's no secret that we here at TechRadar adore Philips' OLED TVs, mostly for their unique Ambilight feature; a series of lights around the frame of the TV that project bold colors around and onto the wall behind. The OLED809 delivers excellent picture quality for a mid-range OLED, but is slightly beaten on overall value by the LG C4 – it's also only available to our UK and European readers. Read our Philips OLED809 review if you like the idea of a TV that feels much bigger than it is, though. Philips OLED909: This is a high-end TV, using the same elite panel as the LG G4, delivering stunningly bright and HDR-rich picture, aided by the Ambilight feature. The built-in Bowers & Wilkins sound system is also a nice addition, adding real meat compared to other built-in TV speakers, and replacing the need for a smaller soundbar. We think the Samsung S95D is a little more versatile and better value for most people, but it's an excellent TV, no question, as our full Philips OLED909 review digs into. Philips OLED959: This is a truly elite TV, but puts itself in quite a niche bracket by coming in very specific sizing, and with a giant metal stand as part of the package. It's also pricier than the competition – and its 'upgraded' version of Philips' Ambilight tech was too busy for us, and doesn't actually feel like a higher-end version. Still, you get amazing image quality and top-tier built-in sound, so if you like the idea of a freestanding TV with awesome AV skills, it's well worth reading our Philips OLED959 review. October 24, 2025Replaced the LG C4 with the newer LG C5 as our 'best for most people' pick, based on our recent testing. August 27, 2025Replaced the Panasonic Z95A with the brand's latest flagship OLED TV, the Panasonic Z95B, as our 'Best for sound' pick.

Title: TPUs vs. GPUs and why Google is positioned to win AI race in the long term

Full Content:
Hey everyone, As I find the topic of Google TPUs extremely important, I am publishing a comprehensive deep dive, not just a technical overview, but also strategic and financial coverage of the Google TPU. Topics covered: The history of the TPU and why it all even started? The difference between a TPU and a GPU? Performance numbers TPU vs GPU? Where are the problems for the wider adoption of TPUs Google’s TPU is the biggest competitive advantage of its cloud business for the next 10 years How many TPUs does Google produce today, and how big can that get? Gemini 3 and the aftermath of Gemini 3 on the whole chip industry Let’s dive into it. The history of the TPU and why it all even started? The story of the Google Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) begins not with a breakthrough in chip manufacturing, but with a realization about math and logistics. Around 2013, Google’s leadership—specifically Jeff Dean, Jonathan Ross (the CEO of Groq), and the Google Brain team—ran a projection that alarmed them. They calculated that if every Android user utilized Google’s new voice search feature for just three minutes a day, the company would need to double its global data center capacity just to handle the compute load. At the time, Google was relying on standard CPUs and GPUs for these tasks. While powerful, these general-purpose chips were inefficient for the specific heavy lifting required by Deep Learning: massive matrix multiplications. Scaling up with existing hardware would have been a financial and logistical nightmare. This sparked a new project. Google decided to do something rare for a software company: build its own custom silicon. The goal was to create an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) designed for one job only: running TensorFlow neural networks. Key Historical Milestones: 2013-2014: The project moved really fast as Google both hired a very capable team and, to be honest, had some luck in their first steps. The team went from design concept to deploying silicon in data centers in just 15 months—a very short cycle for hardware engineering. 2015: Before the world knew they existed, TPUs were already powering Google’s most popular products. They were silently accelerating Google Maps navigation, Google Photos, and Google Translate. 2016: Google officially unveiled the TPU at Google I/O 2016. This urgency to solve the “data center doubling” problem is why the TPU exists. It wasn’t built to sell to gamers or render video; it was built to save Google from its own AI success. With that in mind, Google has been thinking about the »costly« AI inference problems for over a decade now. This is also one of the main reasons why the TPU is so good today compared to other ASIC projects. The difference between a TPU and a GPU? To understand the difference, it helps to look at what each chip was originally built to do. A GPU is a “general-purpose” parallel processor, while a TPU is a “domain-specific” architecture. The GPUs were designed for graphics. They excel at parallel processing (doing many things at once), which is great for AI. However, because they are designed to handle everything from video game textures to scientific simulations, they carry “architectural baggage.” They spend significant energy and chip area on complex tasks like caching, branch prediction, and managing independent threads. A TPU, on the other hand, strips away all that baggage. It has no hardware for rasterization or texture mapping. Instead, it uses a unique architecture called a Systolic Array. The “Systolic Array” is the key differentiator. In a standard CPU or GPU, the chip moves data back and forth between the memory and the computing units for every calculation. This constant shuffling creates a bottleneck (the Von Neumann bottleneck). In a TPU’s systolic array, data flows through the chip like blood through a heart (hence “systolic”). It loads data (weights) once. It passes inputs through a massive grid of multipliers. The data is passed directly to the next unit in the array without writing back to memory. What this means, in essence, is that a TPU, because of its systolic array, drastically reduces the number of memory reads and writes required from HBM. As a result, the TPU can spend its cycles computing rather than waiting for data. Google’s new TPU design, also called Ironwood also addressed some of the key areas where a TPU was lacking: They enhanced the SparseCore for efficiently handling large embeddings (good for recommendation systems and LLMs) It increased HBM capacity and bandwidth (up to 192 GB per chip). For a better understanding, Nvidia’s Blackwell B200 has 192GB per chip, while Blackwell Ultra, also known as the B300, has 288 GB per chip. Improved the Inter-Chip Interconnect (ICI) for linking thousands of chips into massive clusters, also called TPU Pods (needed for AI training as well as some time test compute inference workloads). When it comes to ICI, it is important to note that it is very performant with a Peak Bandwidth of 1.2 TB/s vs Blackwell NVLink 5 at 1.8 TB/s. But Google’s ICI, together with its specialized compiler and software stack, still delivers superior performance on some specific AI tasks. The key thing to understand is that because the TPU doesn’t need to decode complex instructions or constantly access memory, it can deliver significantly higher Operations Per Joule. For scale-out, Google uses Optical Circuit Switch (OCS) and its 3D torus network, which compete with Nvidia’s InfiniBand and Spectrum-X Ethernet. The main difference is that OCS is extremely cost-effective and power-efficient as it eliminates electrical switches and O-E-O conversions, but because of this, it is not as flexible as the other two. So again, the Google stack is extremely specialized for the task at hand and doesn’t offer the flexibility that GPUs do. Performance numbers TPU vs GPU? As we defined the differences, let’s look at real numbers showing how the TPU performs compared to the GPU. Since Google isn’t revealing these numbers, it is really hard to get details on performance. I studied many articles and alternative data sources, including interviews with industry insiders, and here are some of the key takeaways. The first important thing is that there is very limited information on Google’s newest TPUv7 (Ironwood), as Google introduced it in April 2025 and is just now starting to become available to external clients (internally, it is said that Google has already been using Ironwood since April, possibly even for Gemini 3.0.). And why is this important if we, for example, compare TPUv7 with an older but still widely used version of TPUv5p based on Semianalysis data: TPUv7 produces 4,614 TFLOPS(BF16) vs 459 TFLOPS for TPUv5p TPUv7 has 192GB of memory capacity vs TPUv5p 96GB TPUv7 memory Bandwidth is 7,370 GB/s vs 2,765 for v5p We can see that the performance leaps between v5 and v7 are very significant. To put that in context, most of the comments that we will look at are more focused on TPUv6 or TPUv5 than v7. Based on analyzing a ton of interviews with Former Google employees, customers, and competitors (people from AMD, NVDA & others), the summary of the results is as follows. Most agree that TPUs are more cost-effective compared to Nvidia GPUs, and most agree that the performance per watt for TPUs is better. This view is not applicable across all use cases tho. A Former Google Cloud employee: »If it is the right application, then they can deliver much better performance per dollar compared to GPUs. They also require much lesser energy and produces less heat compared to GPUs. They’re also more energy efficient and have a smaller environmental footprint, which is what makes them a desired outcome. The use cases are slightly limited to a GPU, they’re not as generic, but for a specific application, they can offer as much as 1.4X better performance per dollar, which is pretty significant saving for a customer that might be trying to use GPU versus TPUs.« source: AlphaSense Similarly, a very insightful comment from a Former Unit Head at Google around TPUs materially lowering AI-search cost per query vs GPUs: »TPU v6 is 60-65% more efficient than GPUs, prior generations 40-45%« This interview was in November 2024, so the expert is probably comparing the v6 TPU with the Nvidia Hopper. Today, we already have Blackwell vs V7. Many experts also mention the speed benefit that TPUs offer, with a Former Google Head saying that TPUs are 5x faster than GPUs for training dynamic models (like search-like workloads). There was also a very eye-opening interview with a client who used both Nvidia GPUs and Google TPUs as he describes the economics in great detail: »If I were to use eight H100s versus using one v5e pod, I would spend a lot less money on one v5e pod. In terms of price point money, performance per dollar, you will get more bang for TPU. If I already have a code, because of Google’s help or because of our own work, if I know it already is going to work on a TPU, then at that point it is beneficial for me to just stick with the TPU usage. In the long run, if I am thinking I need to write a new code base, I need to do a lot more work, then it depends on how long I’m going to train. I would say there is still some, for example, of the workload we have already done on TPUs that in the future because as Google will add newer generation of TPU, they make older ones much cheaper.For example, when they came out with v4, I remember the price of v2 came down so low that it was practically free to use compared to any NVIDIA GPUs. Google has got a good promise so they keep supporting older TPUs and they’re making it a lot cheaper. If you don’t really need your model trained right away, if you’re willing to say, “I can wait one week,” even though the training is only three days, then you can reduce your cost 1/5.« source: AlphaSense Another valuable interview was with a current AMD employee, acknowledging the benefits of ASICs: »I would expect that an AI accelerator could do about probably typically what we see in the industry. I’m using my experience at FPGAs. I could see a 30% reduction in size and maybe a 50% reduction in power vs a GPU.« We also got some numbers from a Former Google employee who worked in the chip segment: »When I look at the published numbers, they (TPUs) are anywhere from 25%-30% better to close to 2x better, depending on the use cases compared to Nvidia. Essentially, there’s a difference between a very custom design built to do one task perfectly versus a more general purpose design.« What is also known is that the real edge of TPUs lies not in the hardware but in the software and in the way Google has optimized its ecosystem for the TPU. A lot of people mention the problem that every Nvidia »competitor« like the TPU faces, which is the fast development of Nvidia and the constant »catching up« to Nvidia problem. This month a former Google Cloud employee addressed that concern head-on as he believes the rate at which TPUs are improving is faster than the rate at Nvidia: »The amount of performance per dollar that a TPU can generate from a new generation versus the old generation is a much significant jump than Nvidia« In addition, the recent data from Google’s presentation at the Hot Chips 2025 event backs that up, as Google stated that the TPUv7 is 100% better in performance per watt than their TPUv6e (Trillium). Even for hard Nvidia advocates, TPUs are not to be shrugged off easily, as even Jensen thinks very highly of Google’s TPUs. In a podcast with Brad Gerstner, he mentioned that when it comes to ASICs, Google with TPUs is a »special case«. A few months ago, we also got an article from the WSJ saying that after the news publication The Information published a report that stated that OpenAI had begun renting Google TPUs for ChatGPT, Jensen called Altman, asking him if it was true, and signaled that he was open to getting the talks back on track (investment talks). Also worth noting was that Nvidia’s official X account posted a screenshot of an article in which OpenAI denied plans to use Google’s in-house chips. To say the least, Nvidia is watching TPUs very closely. Ok, but after looking at some of these numbers, one might think, why aren’t more clients using TPUs? Where are the problems for the wider adoption of TPUs The main problem for TPUs adoption is the ecosystem. Nvidia’s CUDA is engraved in the minds of most AI engineers, as they have been learning CUDA in universities. Google has developed its ecosystem internally but not externally, as it has used TPUs only for its internal workloads until now. TPUs use a combination of JAX and TensorFlow, while the industry skews to CUDA and PyTorch (although TPUs also support PyTorch now). While Google is working hard to make its ecosystem more supportive and convertible with other stacks, it is also a matter of libraries and ecosystem formation that takes years to develop. It is also important to note that, until recently, the GenAI industry’s focus has largely been on training workloads. In training workloads, CUDA is very important, but when it comes to inference, even reasoning inference, CUDA is not that important, so the chances of expanding the TPU footprint in inference are much higher than those in training (although TPUs do really well in training as well – Gemini 3 the prime example). The fact that most clients are multi-cloud also poses a challenge for TPU adoption, as AI workloads are closely tied to data and its location (cloud data transfer is costly). Nvidia is accessible via all three hyperscalers, while TPUs are available only at GCP so far. A client who uses TPUs and Nvidia GPUs explains it well: »Right now, the one biggest advantage of NVIDIA, and this has been true for past three companies I worked on is because AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, these are the three major cloud companies. Every company, every corporate, every customer we have will have data in one of these three. All these three clouds have NVIDIA GPUs. Sometimes the data is so big and in a different cloud that it is a lot cheaper to run our workload in whatever cloud the customer has data in. I don’t know if you know about the egress cost that is moving data out of one cloud is one of the bigger cost. In that case, if you have NVIDIA workload, if you have a CUDA workload, we can just go to Microsoft Azure, get a VM that has NVIDIA GPU, same GPU in fact, no code change is required and just run it there. With TPUs, once you are all relied on TPU and Google says, “You know what? Now you have to pay 10X more,” then we would be screwed, because then we’ll have to go back and rewrite everything. That’s why. That’s the only reason people are afraid of committing too much on TPUs. The same reason is for Amazon’s Trainium and Inferentia.« source: AlphaSense These problems are well known at Google, so it is no surprise that internally, the debate over keeping TPUs inside Google or starting to sell them externally is a constant topic. When keeping them internally, it enhances the GCP moat, but at the same time, many former Google employees believe that at some point, Google will start offering TPUs externally as well, maybe through some neoclouds, not necessarily with the biggest two competitors, Microsoft and Amazon. Opening up the ecosystem, providing support, etc., and making it more widely usable are the first steps toward making that possible. A former Google employee also mentioned that Google last year formed a more sales-oriented team to push and sell TPUs, so it’s not like they have been pushing hard to sell TPUs for years; it is a fairly new dynamic in the organization. Google’s TPU is the biggest competitive advantage of its cloud business for the next 10 years The most valuable thing for me about TPUs is their impact on GCP. As we witness the transformation of cloud businesses from the pre-AI era to the AI era, the biggest takeaway is that the industry has gone from an oligopoly of AWS, Azure, and GCP to a more commoditized landscape, with Oracle, Coreweave, and many other neoclouds competing for AI workloads. The problem with AI workloads is the competition and Nvidia’s 75% gross margin, which also results in low margins for AI workloads. The cloud industry is moving from a 50-70% gross margin industry to a 20-35% gross margin industry. For cloud investors, this should be concerning, as the future profile of some of these companies is more like that of a utility than an attractive, high-margin business. But there is a solution to avoiding that future and returning to a normal margin: the ASIC. The cloud providers who can control the hardware and are not beholden to Nvidia and its 75% gross margin will be able to return to the world of 50% gross margins. And there is no surprise that all three AWS, Azure, and GCP are developing their own ASICs. The most mature by far is Google’s TPU, followed by Amazon’s Trainum, and lastly Microsoft’s MAIA (although Microsoft owns the full IP of OpenAI’s custom ASICs, which could help them in the future). While even with ASICs you are not 100% independent, as you still have to work with someone like Broadcom or Marvell, whose margins are lower than Nvidia’s but still not negligible, Google is again in a very good position. Over the years of developing TPUs, Google has managed to control much of the chip design process in-house. According to a current AMD employee, Broadcom no longer knows everything about the chip. At this point, Google is the front-end designer (the actual RTL of the design) while Broadcom is only the backend physical design partner. Google, on top of that, also, of course, owns the entire software optimization stack for the chip, which makes it as performant as it is. According to the AMD employee, based on this work split, he thinks Broadcom is lucky if it gets a 50-point gross margin on its part. Without having to pay Nvidia for the accelerator, a cloud provider can either price its compute similarly to others and maintain a better margin profile or lower costs and gain market share. Of course, all of this depends on having a very capable ASIC that can compete with Nvidia. Unfortunately, it looks like Google is the only one that has achieved that, as the number one-performing model is Gemini 3 trained on TPUs. According to some former Google employees, internally, Google is also using TPUs for inference across its entire AI stack, including Gemini and models like Veo. Google buys Nvidia GPUs for GCP, as clients want them because they are familiar with them and the ecosystem, but internally, Google is full-on with TPUs. As the complexity of each generation of ASICs increases, similar to the complexity and pace of Nvidia, I predict that not all ASIC programs will make it. I believe outside of TPUs, the only real hyperscaler shot right now is AWS Trainium, but even that faces much bigger uncertainties than the TPU. With that in mind, Google and its cloud business can come out of this AI era as a major beneficiary and market-share gainer. Recently, we even got comments from the SemiAnalysis team praising the TPU: »Google’s silicon supremacy among hyperscalers is unmatched, with their TPU 7th Gen arguably on par with Nvidia Blackwell. TPU powers the Gemini family of models which are improving in capability and sit close to the pareto frontier of $ per intelligence in some tasks« source: SemiAnalysis How many TPUs does Google produce today, and how big can that get? Here are the numbers that I researched:

BlackRock Bitcoin ETF investors are back in profit, in a promising sign of a December market recovery from the cohort that drove much of Bitcoin’s rise to all-time highs in 2025. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) holders are back in profit after Bitcoin’s recovery above $90,000, an early sign that sentiment may be turning among one of the key investor groups driving the market this year. The holders of the largest spot Bitcoin (BTC) fund, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), bounced back to a cumulative profit of $3.2 billion on Wednesday, according to blockchain data platform Arkham. “BlackRock IBIT and ETHA holders went from being up almost a combined $40 billion at their PnL peak on 7th October, down to $630 million 4 days ago,” wrote Arkham in a Wednesday X post. “This means the average of all BlackRock ETF buys is at just about break-even.” With ETF holders no longer under pressure, Bitcoin ETFs may continue to slow their selling rate, which has seen a significant improvement since the $903 million in outflows recorded on Nov. 20. Bitcoin ETFs recorded two consecutive days of inflows for the first time in two weeks, with a modest $21 million in cumulative inflows on Wednesday, according to Farside Investors.The development is a welcome sign for Bitcoin, as BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF was the only fund to realize net positive inflows for 2025, according to K33 Research. The inflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs were the primary driver of Bitcoin’s momentum in 2025, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, told Cointelegraph recently. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset management firm, with $13.5 trillion in assets under management as of the third quarter of 2025.Related: Over 8% of Bitcoin changed hands in week, markets on ‘knife’s edge,’ Analysts say The broader spot Bitcoin ETF investor cohort is also back in profit after Bitcoin climbed above the key $89,600 flow-weighted cost basis, a level that was lost two weeks ago.Bitcoin’s recovery follows a sharp increase in interest rate cut expectations for the US Federal Reserve’s Dec. 10 meeting, with odds increasing by 46% in a week. Markets are pricing in an 85% chance of a 25 basis point interest rate cut, up from 39% a week ago, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Related: Bitcoin rout continues as crypto treasuries face reckoning: Finance Redefined Two weeks ago, Bitcoin’s price correction pushed Bitcoin ETF holders below their flow-weighted cost basis near $89,600, according to Glassnode analyst Sean Rose, with the average holder facing paper losses on their investment. However, most ETF holders are “long-term allocators,” meaning that “being underwater doesn’t trigger quick exits,” Vincent Liu, the chief investment officer at quantitative trading firm Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Black Friday is here, and there are lots of deals to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated November 28: We have reviewed the best prices and found some of the best price drops we’ve seen, all of which are included below. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout the day. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicks off today, with deals lasting until Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’ll also be checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found over the four days, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Black Friday Tip: While shopping this Black Friday we’ve noticed that on Amazon if you delay your delivery date there are additional 3% savings to be had in the U.S. (2% in the U.K.)! This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart then it can add up to a decent saving. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $200 off it’s a superb saving. We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 have dipped as low as $139 at Walmart. That’s a hard deal to pass up. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 and $100 AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation are simply mind-blowing. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that those deals can sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers should keep an eye on Amazon for price drops on the AirPods Pro 2, which were out of stock (and only showing used models) when we checked, but we’ve seen stock come and go and expect to see again the £169 price for new models we have seen twice in November already. Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’re looking for at least $50 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. Finally, the standard entry-level iPad is the bare-bones option in Apple’s lineup, but it still has a great screen, a capable processor, and great battery life. It’s great for kids and an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $279. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Black Friday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or $74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 / $20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

Title: One-Third of Rich Young Clients Move Money Over Lack of Crypto Access: Report

Institutional wealth managers might lose young crypto investors due to the absence of digital asset offerings, a new survey shows. Recently, decentralized finance (DeFi) became more intertwined with mainstream firms as users backed on-chain use-cases. A new survey conducted by crypto payment firm ZeroHash highlights the growing adoption of digital asset offerings, especially among young investors. Participants indicated that they are willing to change wealth managers because exposure to crypto assets is not on the table. About a third of investors are in search of crypto offerings supporting the position. More practically, over 50% of participants said they moved between $250,000 and $1 million in search of crypto products. This shows the skyrocketing demand for digital assets and recent institutional investments in the market. Meanwhile, 18% of young investors pulled out less than $100k from funds with virtual assets, and 5.3% transferred over $1 million. The majority claim their stance was influenced by heavy institutional accumulation in recent months. According to the survey, if large institutional firms like BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, etc are increasing exposure to crypto, smaller investors should follow a similar path. Meanwhile, 84% of investors said they plan to increase their crypto holdings in the next 12 months. This adoption spike is expected after crypto assets like Bitcoin tapped all-time highs this year, with analysts tipping a bull case of $1 million by 2030. Short-term projections suggest a run above $150k despite recent setbacks triggered by mass liquidations. Crypto users became more bullish after the United States’ positive stance, prompting a surge in institutional demand. Most young investors now feel confident about the market’s future. Previously, several institutional giants refused to include virtual assets in their portfolios, citing concerns about manipulation. “Crypto assets have become essential to modern portfolio strategy with users not waiting for their private wealth managers to catch up… Advisers who adapt early can strengthen client loyalty and capture new growth, while those who delay risk falling behind,” the report added. Furthermore, 92% of participants say a broader range of crypto-based investment products is required, a move away from the dominant Bitcoin and Ethereum offerings. This year, altcoins like Solana and XRP recorded consecutive inflows into institutional products as the market awaits spot ETFs and more decentralized finance use cases.

SP Lover's notes SIMON_ Matrix Featured Article Matrix is the writing community of SSPAI, where we encourage sharing authentic product experiences, practical insights, and thoughtful reflections. We regularly feature the finest Matrix articles to showcase genuine perspectives from real users. The article represents the author’s personal views. SSPAI has only made minor edits to the title and formatting.Featured on the Matrix homepage 2025 marks my fifth year in Japan. Ever since I moved here in 2021, I’ve made it a habit to review my yearly spending at the end of each year and share the items I used most frequently and enjoyed the most. This year is no exception. Rather than a “best-of” product list, it’s more like a reflection on my year. Since I continued traveling frequently in 2025, my spending still leaned toward outdoor and lifestyle items, with very little interest in upgrading tech gadgets. So once again, the “Lifestyle” section comes first — if you’re only here for the “Tech” part, feel free to scroll straight down. Following my principle that “there is no perfect product,” this year’s list also includes a brief “downsides” section for each item to help give a more balanced impression. And because I want to save you the trouble of hunting down prices and where to buy things, I’ll do my best to include a reference price1 and purchase channel2 under each recommendation. The North Face Expedition Series Parka A parka warm enough to handle –20°C, and it accompanied me through the harsh winters of two Northeasts (China’s Northeast and Japan’s Tōhoku) as well as Hokkaido. The reason I chose this jacket is simple: among down jackets, it has the best silhouette, and among parkas, it’s one of the warmest. As one of the premium offerings from The North Face Japan line, this coat features nearly all of their signature technologies: GORE-TEX (2-layer, not 3-layer), PERTEX Quantum (originally used for UK parachutes, later acquired by Mitsui Japan), CLEANDOWN (high-cleanliness down from a long-established Mie Prefecture manufacturer), and Photon Thermo (The North Face Japan’s go-to thermal tech — essentially far-infrared). It may not be the ultimate top-tier product, but it’s extremely versatile and dependable for cold regions. It also frequently goes on sale, so I recommend waiting for discounts to get the best value. Downsides: The jacket is heavy; harder to pack than typical down jackets; faux fur hood trim is mediocre; the new model (ND92546) costs ¥2,000 more without noticeable improvements. ARC’TERYX Gamma MX Hoody This year, aside from shells, I bought quite a bit of Arc’teryx: wool socks, gloves, Gamma pants and tops, quick-dry tees, Atom jackets, hats — basically one of each iconic item. Among everything I’ve tried, the Gamma series is the most worth buying. It has repeatedly appeared on “Best Outdoor Softshell” lists and is often sold out. The Gamma MX I purchased was originally designed as a close-fitting piece for ice climbing, but in recent years the fit has been updated to a more relaxed style, making it suitable for all body types and everyday wear. Details are excellent for this price point: Fortius™ 2.0 fabric for wind resistance and light water repellency with breathability; reinforced glued seams at the hem and hood; windproof cuffs; and a fleeced interior for warmth in spring and autumn. The reason I recommend the Gamma series: it’s one of the few Arc’teryx lines that genuinely works across multiple scenarios. With three different thicknesses available, there’s an option for both northern and southern climates. In spring and fall, it works perfectly as an outer layer; in winter or during outdoor activities, pairing it with a down jacket or hardshell turns it into a warm and reliable mid-layer. The Fortius™ fabric is very stretchy — great for outdoor sports and commuting — and the light water resistance is enough for Japan’s rainy season. The more straightforward reason I bought it this year: the new olive-green color was simply irresistible. Downsides: Expensive. The avalanche incident earlier this year severely damaged the brand’s reputation, and I strongly disapprove of that behavior. However, based on the Arc’teryx events I’ve attended in Japan, their Japan operations are still outstanding. EVERGOODS × Carryology MPL22 Backpack When looking for a new backpack this year, I compared popular brands such as Aer, Able Carry, ALPAKA, and Matador. But considering my actual needs — a pack suitable for both inter-city commuting and light hiking around urban outskirts — I ultimately chose the EVERGOODS MPL22. The MPL22 is designed specifically to transition seamlessly between mountain trails and city streets, making it a perfect match for my use cases. The only issue: the standard MPL22 uses 420d nylon, which doesn’t have the same crisp, structured look as X-Pac and looks a bit too plain in full black. Appearance-wise, it simply didn’t excite me. The collaboration edition I eventually bought upgrades the material to ULTRA 200TX — an ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fabric — offering full waterproofing and exceptional strength. The gray exterior has a refined titanium-like sheen under light, paired with a bright blue interior (TX70 ULTRA), a color combination I really love. In addition, several small design details were upgraded from the standard version:• A metal Velcro patch featuring the Krudde (a fearsome creature from Dutch folklore)• YKK’s high-performance RC-series water-resistant zippers• Anodized aluminum hardware• A fully suspended laptop compartment• A hidden pocket designed to store an AirTagAnd many more thoughtful touches — too many to list here. Interested readers can refer to the official making-of notes and videos linked later. After several months of use, whether hiking, trekking, or commuting, I remain extremely satisfied with this bag. Its 22L capacity is just right — never bulky. The adjustable sternum strap adapts well to my body, offering excellent carrying comfort. The internal pocket layout is also very smart, allowing every piece of my EDC to find its perfect spot. If you’re curious about this backpack, check out the official YouTube video or the detailed manufacturing notes to understand its design philosophy and construction. Downsides: The collaboration model is expensive — the standard version offers far better value. Also, the lack of a luggage pass-through strap is a notable regret. YAMANO3 Flower MOUNTAIN × NANGA Outdoor Shoes Flower MOUNTAIN is a relatively niche brand. Although I’d been aware of it for a while, it didn’t truly enter my radar until this collaboration with the Japanese outdoor brand NANGA. I saw this pair in person at NANGA’s Harajuku store — my first impression was that the design looked striking and the craftsmanship appeared refined. After trying them on and finding the comfort surprisingly good, I decided to buy them. Compared with the regular YAMANO3, the collaboration model features two major upgrades: What also appealed to me was the Microban lining, which provides antibacterial and deodorizing properties, and the cork insole, which offers excellent moisture absorption. The shoes I initially bought purely for their looks have now accompanied me up Mount Asahi and Mount Kuro, and have been worn for multiple outdoor hikes and rainy-day strolls. Similar to the backpack mentioned earlier, I’d describe these shoes as suitable for both city streetwear and light outdoor use. Overall, it’s a collaboration that balances style and function — matching NANGA’s outdoor DNA while retaining Flower MOUNTAIN’s distinctly Japanese aesthetic. Downsides: Due to the waterproof materials, breathability is somewhat limited, making them better suited for autumn and winter. They are intended for light outdoor activities rather than professional-level hiking. KEEN HYPERPORT CLOG LEATHER KEEN, a Japanese brand, released this all-season clog in 2025. Known for its near-obsessive dedication to sandal design (alongside its outdoor line), KEEN launches countless sandal models each year—yet none have ever truly appealed to me aesthetically. This year’s model, however, feels like a hybrid between a Birkenstock clog and something uniquely KEEN. The upper is made of leather and equipped with an easily adjustable buckle for a secure fit outdoors. The outsole uses the brand’s own Aquagrip rubber for reliable slip resistance. What convinced me to choose this pair was simple: more affordable than Birkenstocks, and much easier to style. After wearing them for a full year, I can say they are extremely comfortable. The toe box is wide enough for natural movement, and the thick midsole makes them far more suitable for outdoor casual use compared to regular slippers. Shopping, commuting—no problem at all. Two Brands: SHIRO & LINC CORPORATION This year, my skincare trials revolved mainly around two brands from Hokkaido: SHIRO and LINC ORIGINAL MAKERS. SHIRO is known for its natural ingredients and signature “transparent freshness.” The FREESIA MIST continues this tradition with a fresh fragrance profile: a bright fruity opening of apple and apricot, a floral mid-note, and a subtle woody base. The texture is thin and spreads smoothly, leaving the skin with a moisturized, subtly glossy finish once absorbed. LINC also highlights naturally derived scents. The No. 997 hand cream I picked leans fruity as well. According to the brand, the top notes bring a sweet-tart orchard freshness; the middle notes blend the clarity of geranium and lily of the valley, like sunlight filtering through grass; the base introduces a soft sandalwood reminiscent of a tranquil forest breeze. In practice, the sandalwood lingers the longest (a bit similar to LE LABO’s newly released Santal 33?), refined and non-greasy. Compared to SHIRO, the LINC cream has a thicker texture and longer-lasting scent. Downsides: SHIRO’s fragrance can become cloying over time—or, as many say, may smell a bit “cheap.” Best to try it in person if possible. Costco 93% Duck Down Comforter This winter has been one of the colder ones in Japan, so I picked up this duck down comforter while it was on sale at Costco. The biggest change it brought is that the entire winter, getting into bed felt like sinking into a hotel duvet—extremely comfortable. The best thing about down comforters is that they’re warm yet lightweight. The duck down filling is also of high cleanliness with no unpleasant odor whatsoever. I bought the 1 kg version with 95% duck down fill, and there’s also a goose-down option. Regardless of version, all the down is certified by CIL (Comprehensive Sleep Institute), meets RDS international standards, and is processed with Aller G Plus deodorizing and antibacterial treatment. Being able to trust the filling is the biggest reason I recommend it. In Japan, Japanese-made down comforters often cost over ¥100,000 (e.g., Nishikawa). This Costco comforter is a breath of fresh air—affordable, and even discounted during winter. My final purchase price was ¥12,980, making it incredibly cost-effective. Downsides: None so far. Bellroy Lite Duffel Gym Bag This is a gym bag with excellent texture and craftsmanship, supporting two carrying modes: hand-carry and shoulder-carry (with a detachable strap included). The interior is well-organized, with two bottle pockets and two small item pockets; there’s a built-in AirTag pocket; and the bag can be folded down into a compact size when not in use. The capacity is just right for me. The exterior fabric is water-repellent and has successfully protected my belongings through several surprise downpours; the bag itself is lightweight, making it perfect for going back and forth between home and the gym. Downsides: Expensive at full price. No dedicated shoe compartment. As a travel bag, it lacks a strap to secure it onto a suitcase handle. Patagonia Capilene® Cool Daily Shirt Quick-Dry Baselayer Thanks to the fitness habit I mentioned earlier, I tried quite a few base layer brands this year: Lululemon, Mizuno, Arc’teryx, Montbell and so on. After comparing these, the one most worth recommending is Patagonia’s C1 quick-dry. That’s almost stating the obvious—anyone who knows Patagonia a bit probably already knows that one of their must-try products is the Capilene C1 quick-dry series. The reason I recommend it is that it strikes a great balance between price and performance: it feels great to wear, has excellent quick-drying and odor-control capabilities, comes with a tear-off care label, and is reasonably priced. As for other brands, if we ignore price, Arc’teryx’s Konseal Pocket quick-dry series would probably be my top pick. Unfortunately, the price is high enough to buy at least two pieces from other brands, so I’m not including it in the recommendation list. Downside: It does nothing to hide your body shape—any “flaws” will be fully exposed. Kao Steam Eye Mask (Lavender Scent) An old product in new packaging. A friend once randomly gave me one to try, and I’ve been hooked ever since. These Kao steam eye masks have kept me company through many nights, as well as countless breaks on long bus and plane rides. They’re designed as single-use, so they’re very lightweight, easy to carry, and you just toss them after use—super convenient. There is an unscented version, but I still prefer the scented ones, especially lavender and osmanthus; those scents make it easier for me to slip into a relaxed, sleepy state. Of course, this is very subjective, but it works extremely well for me. Downside: None for now. Mitsubishi Uni-ball Zento Sign Pen The magnetic cap is dangerously addictive—you’ll find yourself clicking it open and shut nonstop. The pen itself has a metal body with a matte coating, giving it a premium feel. The newly developed ZENTO ink includes a “POA surfactant,” which reduces friction against paper even further, resulting in an exceptionally smooth writing experience and minimal ghosting. The weight distribution of the pen has also been adjusted so that the center of gravity sits near the web of your hand, making it comfortable even during extended writing sessions. The overall balance is excellent—you can almost feel that “the pen moves with your mind” smoothness the moment you pick it up. Downside: Pricey. If you just want to try the smooth ink, the standard model is enough. THE SUPERIOR LABOR Wallet In my earlier article “Three Years with a Backpack: My Travel Gear List,” I mentioned wanting a short wallet to replace the long one I had been using. My options at the time were RE:FORM and Bellroy, but the former’s material attracts dust easily, while the latter doesn’t fit well with Japan’s coin-heavy payment habits. Just in time for THE SUPERIOR LABOR’s year-end sale, I picked up this classic Japanese-style wallet at a great price. I call it a “Japanese wallet” mainly because of two features (which also made me choose it): First, despite being a bi-fold wallet with limited space, it includes a coin pocket that opens at a wide angle—perfect for Japan’s cash-centered society. In my case I rarely use coins, so I use this pocket to store my AirTag instead. Second, the craftsmanship. This wallet is made from Japanese Black Wagyu leather, often called the “black diamond of the leather world.” It is tanned using the traditional shironameshi method, which avoids chemical agents and instead uses natural materials like shell ash, salt, and oils. The coloring is done with urushi-nuri, a technique that uses lacquer tree sap. Both methods are traditional techniques and very much reflect Japanese craftsmanship philosophy. Downside: Because of the coin-pocket design, the wallet is on the thicker side. As always, here are some food and drink recommendations to wrap up the lifestyle section: IYOSHI COLA Japan’s version of Laoshan Cola: a cola base infused with traditional herbal ingredients, essentially a medicinal-style Coca-Cola. If you enjoy Laoshan Cola, you’ll almost certainly like Iyoshi Cola—the herbal taste is even stronger, and you’ll often find a bit of herbal sediment at the bottom. This is the kind of drink people either absolutely love or flat-out hate. If you’re a fan of herbal flavors, it’s definitely worth a try. Iyoshi Cola has easily become the drink I consume most frequently this year—nothing else even comes close. Downside: Expensive; the distinctive medicinal flavor can be off-putting for some. Tokyo Milk Cheese Factory Cookies One of my favorite snacks this year. They come in a variety of flavors; my personal picks are Truffle & Cheddar (savory-sweet) and Uji Matcha (sweet). The cookies look a bit like Shiroi Koibito, but taste much better: crisp yet not dry, with smooth, layered fillings that never feel cloying. The Truffle & Cheddar flavor has a subtle savory aroma, with the truffle fragrance blending harmoniously—perfect when paired with black tea as an afternoon treat. The Uji Matcha version balances a gentle bitterness with the soft sweetness of mascarpone, resulting in a wonderfully delicate flavor profile. Downside: Uses no animal butter; the ingredient list is noticeably long… Then let’s talk about two things that aren’t practical but add emotional value: Alapaka 9th Anniversary Limited-Edition Patch A limited-edition badge collection released for ALPAKA’s 9th anniversary. The brand invited nine renowned street artists from around the world, each offering their own creative interpretation of ALPAKA’s core theme — “Keep Moving Forward.” Each patch has a completely different style, and I switch them around on my various accessory bags. No deeper reason — they just look cool. We Are Twinkle People I bought some Pop Mart stock earlier this year and sold too early. Recently I discovered that the Twinkle figures are way too cute. When I’m in a bad mood, giving the little Twinkle guy a squish instantly lifts my spirits. No major purpose — just emotional value as a little “gift back” to Pop Mart for that stock. The rest is pure serotonin. This year’s tech section can be summed up as “nothing remarkable.” My usual habit of upgrading my iPhone annually was interrupted — although I did buy the latest iPhone 17 Pro Max, I immediately sold it to a buyback shop. Overall, I’ve hit a “vacuum phase” with electronics, feeling little motivation to replace or upgrade anything throughout the year. DJI Action 5 Pro As I mentioned in My Travel Gear List After Three Years of Backpacking, the main purpose of this purchase was to replace my old GoPro 9 — pairing it with a car mount for road-trip scenery, or a neck mount for hiking and trekking logs. The 30,000-yen purchase price plus points made it a great deal. The compact body is easy to carry, and compared with my old GoPro, the magnetic mounting system saves a lot of hassle during setup and removal Downside: DJI released the Action 6 at the end of this year, making the 5 Pro an older model. Personally, though, I don’t see a strong reason to upgrade. Panasonic ES-PV3A Electric Shaver A frequent appearance in my recommendations this year. Lightweight, long-lasting battery, USB-C charging — all solid selling points. But the real highlight is how incredibly compact it is: super portable without compromising shaving performance. I’ve tried Braun’s foil shavers before, but had to switch back to Philips after developing a nickel allergy to Braun’s foil. Panasonic’s ES-PV3A, however, contains no nickel, and its foil head shaves noticeably cleaner than Philips’ rotary design. It has become an absolute essential for my trips this year. Downside: Zhitai Portable SSD Because of work, I’ve used portable drives from Samsung, SanDisk, LaCie, and others. Earlier this year, I bought my first domestically made portable SSD — the Zhitai. After nearly a year of heavy usage (storing large quantities of photos and videos, long continuous data transfers), it has remained extremely stable and reliable. Compared with Samsung’s T7 series, the Zhitai drive is cheaper and faster. While long-term durability still needs more time to judge, its performance so far has been excellent. The included dual-head data cable and surprisingly good-quality carrying case also add extra value to the overall package. Nitecore EDC23 Flashlight Since rural areas in Japan often lack streetlights — and because I frequently walk mountain roads at night — I still need a compact flashlight for safety. The EDC23’s flat, compact design is highly portable, yet it can instantly burst to 2,500 lumens of brightness. USB-C charging is another major convenience, saving me from carrying a proprietary cable. I also bought two other popular models this year — the SK-05 and Xiaomi’s multifunction portable flashlight. Both perform well, but due to size differences, neither is as convenient to carry as the EDC23, so I’ll leave them out for now. Downside:The 2,550-lumen turbo mode only lasts a few seconds before the flashlight forces a cooldown. Razer Pro Click V2 Ergonomic Mouse I bought this as a replacement for my current Logitech MX Vertical ergonomic mouse. Compared with the MX Vertical, the Pro Click V2 is better suited for users with larger hands. Once you get used to Razer’s grip style, you’ll find that its mold design is more reasonable and comfortable than the MX Vertical. The matte plastic shell is also a huge advantage for someone like me with “acidic hands”—it doesn’t get corroded or damaged by sweat the way the rubber coating on the MX Vertical does. In addition, its DPI is significantly higher than Logitech’s, making cursor movements more responsive and precise, especially on high-resolution monitors or multi-screen setups. Downside:Just like Logitech’s office drivers, Razer’s software is terrible. The mouse also has a built-in RGB light—if you leave it on, battery life drops drastically. When connected via Bluetooth, wake-from-sleep is noticeably slower than Logitech’s. This is both the conclusion and the disclaimer. Everything listed above represents items that I personally selected with great care throughout the year — but my definition of “good products” is entirely subjective. These items are simply what best fit me, not necessarily what will fit everyone. If anything here gives you even a little inspiration, then that alone makes this article worthwhile. There is no such thing as a perfect product, but I hope this 2025 favorites roundup offers you a broader reference range for your future purchases. If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment below — I’d be happy to chat.See you again in the 2026 favorites share.

In addition, several small design details were upgraded from the standard version:• A metal Velcro patch featuring the Krudde (a fearsome creature from Dutch folklore)• YKK’s high-performance RC-series water-resistant zippers• Anodized aluminum hardware• A fully suspended laptop compartment• A hidden pocket designed to store an AirTagAnd many more thoughtful touches — too many to list here. Interested readers can refer to the official making-of notes and videos linked later. After several months of use, whether hiking, trekking, or commuting, I remain extremely satisfied with this bag. Its 22L capacity is just right — never bulky. The adjustable sternum strap adapts well to my body, offering excellent carrying comfort. The internal pocket layout is also very smart, allowing every piece of my EDC to find its perfect spot. If you’re curious about this backpack, check out the official YouTube video or the detailed manufacturing notes to understand its design philosophy and construction. Downsides: The collaboration model is expensive — the standard version offers far better value. Also, the lack of a luggage pass-through strap is a notable regret. YAMANO3 Flower MOUNTAIN × NANGA Outdoor Shoes Flower MOUNTAIN is a relatively niche brand. Although I’d been aware of it for a while, it didn’t truly enter my radar until this collaboration with the Japanese outdoor brand NANGA. I saw this pair in person at NANGA’s Harajuku store — my first impression was that the design looked striking and the craftsmanship appeared refined. After trying them on and finding the comfort surprisingly good, I decided to buy them. Compared with the regular YAMANO3, the collaboration model features two major upgrades: What also appealed to me was the Microban lining, which provides antibacterial and deodorizing properties, and the cork insole, which offers excellent moisture absorption. The shoes I initially bought purely for their looks have now accompanied me up Mount Asahi and Mount Kuro, and have been worn for multiple outdoor hikes and rainy-day strolls. Similar to the backpack mentioned earlier, I’d describe these shoes as suitable for both city streetwear and light outdoor use. Overall, it’s a collaboration that balances style and function — matching NANGA’s outdoor DNA while retaining Flower MOUNTAIN’s distinctly Japanese aesthetic. Downsides: Due to the waterproof materials, breathability is somewhat limited, making them better suited for autumn and winter. They are intended for light outdoor activities rather than professional-level hiking. KEEN HYPERPORT CLOG LEATHER KEEN, a Japanese brand, released this all-season clog in 2025. Known for its near-obsessive dedication to sandal design (alongside its outdoor line), KEEN launches countless sandal models each year—yet none have ever truly appealed to me aesthetically. This year’s model, however, feels like a hybrid between a Birkenstock clog and something uniquely KEEN. The upper is made of leather and equipped with an easily adjustable buckle for a secure fit outdoors. The outsole uses the brand’s own Aquagrip rubber for reliable slip resistance. What convinced me to choose this pair was simple: more affordable than Birkenstocks, and much easier to style. After wearing them for a full year, I can say they are extremely comfortable. The toe box is wide enough for natural movement, and the thick midsole makes them far more suitable for outdoor casual use compared to regular slippers. Shopping, commuting—no problem at all. Two Brands: SHIRO & LINC CORPORATION This year, my skincare trials revolved mainly around two brands from Hokkaido: SHIRO and LINC ORIGINAL MAKERS. SHIRO is known for its natural ingredients and signature “transparent freshness.” The FREESIA MIST continues this tradition with a fresh fragrance profile: a bright fruity opening of apple and apricot, a floral mid-note, and a subtle woody base. The texture is thin and spreads smoothly, leaving the skin with a moisturized, subtly glossy finish once absorbed. LINC also highlights naturally derived scents. The No. 997 hand cream I picked leans fruity as well. According to the brand, the top notes bring a sweet-tart orchard freshness; the middle notes blend the clarity of geranium and lily of the valley, like sunlight filtering through grass; the base introduces a soft sandalwood reminiscent of a tranquil forest breeze. In practice, the sandalwood lingers the longest (a bit similar to LE LABO’s newly released Santal 33?), refined and non-greasy. Compared to SHIRO, the LINC cream has a thicker texture and longer-lasting scent. Downsides: SHIRO’s fragrance can become cloying over time—or, as many say, may smell a bit “cheap.” Best to try it in person if possible. Costco 93% Duck Down Comforter This winter has been one of the colder ones in Japan, so I picked up this duck down comforter while it was on sale at Costco. The biggest change it brought is that the entire winter, getting into bed felt like sinking into a hotel duvet—extremely comfortable. The best thing about down comforters is that they’re warm yet lightweight. The duck down filling is also of high cleanliness with no unpleasant odor whatsoever. I bought the 1 kg version with 95% duck down fill, and there’s also a goose-down option. Regardless of version, all the down is certified by CIL (Comprehensive Sleep Institute), meets RDS international standards, and is processed with Aller G Plus deodorizing and antibacterial treatment. Being able to trust the filling is the biggest reason I recommend it. In Japan, Japanese-made down comforters often cost over ¥100,000 (e.g., Nishikawa). This Costco comforter is a breath of fresh air—affordable, and even discounted during winter. My final purchase price was ¥12,980, making it incredibly cost-effective. Downsides: None so far. Bellroy Lite Duffel Gym Bag This is a gym bag with excellent texture and craftsmanship, supporting two carrying modes: hand-carry and shoulder-carry (with a detachable strap included). The interior is well-organized, with two bottle pockets and two small item pockets; there’s a built-in AirTag pocket; and the bag can be folded down into a compact size when not in use. The capacity is just right for me. The exterior fabric is water-repellent and has successfully protected my belongings through several surprise downpours; the bag itself is lightweight, making it perfect for going back and forth between home and the gym. Downsides: Expensive at full price. No dedicated shoe compartment. As a travel bag, it lacks a strap to secure it onto a suitcase handle. Patagonia Capilene® Cool Daily Shirt Quick-Dry Baselayer Thanks to the fitness habit I mentioned earlier, I tried quite a few base layer brands this year: Lululemon, Mizuno, Arc’teryx, Montbell and so on. After comparing these, the one most worth recommending is Patagonia’s C1 quick-dry. That’s almost stating the obvious—anyone who knows Patagonia a bit probably already knows that one of their must-try products is the Capilene C1 quick-dry series. The reason I recommend it is that it strikes a great balance between price and performance: it feels great to wear, has excellent quick-drying and odor-control capabilities, comes with a tear-off care label, and is reasonably priced. As for other brands, if we ignore price, Arc’teryx’s Konseal Pocket quick-dry series would probably be my top pick. Unfortunately, the price is high enough to buy at least two pieces from other brands, so I’m not including it in the recommendation list. Downside: It does nothing to hide your body shape—any “flaws” will be fully exposed. Kao Steam Eye Mask (Lavender Scent) An old product in new packaging. A friend once randomly gave me one to try, and I’ve been hooked ever since. These Kao steam eye masks have kept me company through many nights, as well as countless breaks on long bus and plane rides. They’re designed as single-use, so they’re very lightweight, easy to carry, and you just toss them after use—super convenient. There is an unscented version, but I still prefer the scented ones, especially lavender and osmanthus; those scents make it easier for me to slip into a relaxed, sleepy state. Of course, this is very subjective, but it works extremely well for me. Downside: None for now. Mitsubishi Uni-ball Zento Sign Pen The magnetic cap is dangerously addictive—you’ll find yourself clicking it open and shut nonstop. The pen itself has a metal body with a matte coating, giving it a premium feel. The newly developed ZENTO ink includes a “POA surfactant,” which reduces friction against paper even further, resulting in an exceptionally smooth writing experience and minimal ghosting. The weight distribution of the pen has also been adjusted so that the center of gravity sits near the web of your hand, making it comfortable even during extended writing sessions. The overall balance is excellent—you can almost feel that “the pen moves with your mind” smoothness the moment you pick it up. Downside: Pricey. If you just want to try the smooth ink, the standard model is enough. THE SUPERIOR LABOR Wallet In my earlier article “Three Years with a Backpack: My Travel Gear List,” I mentioned wanting a short wallet to replace the long one I had been using. My options at the time were RE:FORM and Bellroy, but the former’s material attracts dust easily, while the latter doesn’t fit well with Japan’s coin-heavy payment habits. Just in time for THE SUPERIOR LABOR’s year-end sale, I picked up this classic Japanese-style wallet at a great price. I call it a “Japanese wallet” mainly because of two features (which also made me choose it): First, despite being a bi-fold wallet with limited space, it includes a coin pocket that opens at a wide angle—perfect for Japan’s cash-centered society. In my case I rarely use coins, so I use this pocket to store my AirTag instead. Second, the craftsmanship. This wallet is made from Japanese Black Wagyu leather, often called the “black diamond of the leather world.” It is tanned using the traditional shironameshi method, which avoids chemical agents and instead uses natural materials like shell ash, salt, and oils. The coloring is done with urushi-nuri, a technique that uses lacquer tree sap. Both methods are traditional techniques and very much reflect Japanese craftsmanship philosophy. Downside: Because of the coin-pocket design, the wallet is on the thicker side. As always, here are some food and drink recommendations to wrap up the lifestyle section: IYOSHI COLA Japan’s version of Laoshan Cola: a cola base infused with traditional herbal ingredients, essentially a medicinal-style Coca-Cola. If you enjoy Laoshan Cola, you’ll almost certainly like Iyoshi Cola—the herbal taste is even stronger, and you’ll often find a bit of herbal sediment at the bottom. This is the kind of drink people either absolutely love or flat-out hate. If you’re a fan of herbal flavors, it’s definitely worth a try. Iyoshi Cola has easily become the drink I consume most frequently this year—nothing else even comes close. Downside: Expensive; the distinctive medicinal flavor can be off-putting for some. Tokyo Milk Cheese Factory Cookies One of my favorite snacks this year. They come in a variety of flavors; my personal picks are Truffle & Cheddar (savory-sweet) and Uji Matcha (sweet). The cookies look a bit like Shiroi Koibito, but taste much better: crisp yet not dry, with smooth, layered fillings that never feel cloying. The Truffle & Cheddar flavor has a subtle savory aroma, with the truffle fragrance blending harmoniously—perfect when paired with black tea as an afternoon treat. The Uji Matcha version balances a gentle bitterness with the soft sweetness of mascarpone, resulting in a wonderfully delicate flavor profile. Downside: Uses no animal butter; the ingredient list is noticeably long… Then let’s talk about two things that aren’t practical but add emotional value: Alapaka 9th Anniversary Limited-Edition Patch A limited-edition badge collection released for ALPAKA’s 9th anniversary. The brand invited nine renowned street artists from around the world, each offering their own creative interpretation of ALPAKA’s core theme — “Keep Moving Forward.” Each patch has a completely different style, and I switch them around on my various accessory bags. No deeper reason — they just look cool. We Are Twinkle People I bought some Pop Mart stock earlier this year and sold too early. Recently I discovered that the Twinkle figures are way too cute. When I’m in a bad mood, giving the little Twinkle guy a squish instantly lifts my spirits. No major purpose — just emotional value as a little “gift back” to Pop Mart for that stock. The rest is pure serotonin. This year’s tech section can be summed up as “nothing remarkable.” My usual habit of upgrading my iPhone annually was interrupted — although I did buy the latest iPhone 17 Pro Max, I immediately sold it to a buyback shop. Overall, I’ve hit a “vacuum phase” with electronics, feeling little motivation to replace or upgrade anything throughout the year. DJI Action 5 Pro As I mentioned in My Travel Gear List After Three Years of Backpacking, the main purpose of this purchase was to replace my old GoPro 9 — pairing it with a car mount for road-trip scenery, or a neck mount for hiking and trekking logs. The 30,000-yen purchase price plus points made it a great deal. The compact body is easy to carry, and compared with my old GoPro, the magnetic mounting system saves a lot of hassle during setup and removal Downside: DJI released the Action 6 at the end of this year, making the 5 Pro an older model. Personally, though, I don’t see a strong reason to upgrade. Panasonic ES-PV3A Electric Shaver A frequent appearance in my recommendations this year. Lightweight, long-lasting battery, USB-C charging — all solid selling points. But the real highlight is how incredibly compact it is: super portable without compromising shaving performance. I’ve tried Braun’s foil shavers before, but had to switch back to Philips after developing a nickel allergy to Braun’s foil. Panasonic’s ES-PV3A, however, contains no nickel, and its foil head shaves noticeably cleaner than Philips’ rotary design. It has become an absolute essential for my trips this year. Downside: Zhitai Portable SSD Because of work, I’ve used portable drives from Samsung, SanDisk, LaCie, and others. Earlier this year, I bought my first domestically made portable SSD — the Zhitai. After nearly a year of heavy usage (storing large quantities of photos and videos, long continuous data transfers), it has remained extremely stable and reliable. Compared with Samsung’s T7 series, the Zhitai drive is cheaper and faster. While long-term durability still needs more time to judge, its performance so far has been excellent. The included dual-head data cable and surprisingly good-quality carrying case also add extra value to the overall package. Nitecore EDC23 Flashlight Since rural areas in Japan often lack streetlights — and because I frequently walk mountain roads at night — I still need a compact flashlight for safety. The EDC23’s flat, compact design is highly portable, yet it can instantly burst to 2,500 lumens of brightness. USB-C charging is another major convenience, saving me from carrying a proprietary cable. I also bought two other popular models this year — the SK-05 and Xiaomi’s multifunction portable flashlight. Both perform well, but due to size differences, neither is as convenient to carry as the EDC23, so I’ll leave them out for now. Downside:The 2,550-lumen turbo mode only lasts a few seconds before the flashlight forces a cooldown. Razer Pro Click V2 Ergonomic Mouse I bought this as a replacement for my current Logitech MX Vertical ergonomic mouse. Compared with the MX Vertical, the Pro Click V2 is better suited for users with larger hands. Once you get used to Razer’s grip style, you’ll find that its mold design is more reasonable and comfortable than the MX Vertical. The matte plastic shell is also a huge advantage for someone like me with “acidic hands”—it doesn’t get corroded or damaged by sweat the way the rubber coating on the MX Vertical does. In addition, its DPI is significantly higher than Logitech’s, making cursor movements more responsive and precise, especially on high-resolution monitors or multi-screen setups. Downside:Just like Logitech’s office drivers, Razer’s software is terrible. The mouse also has a built-in RGB light—if you leave it on, battery life drops drastically. When connected via Bluetooth, wake-from-sleep is noticeably slower than Logitech’s. This is both the conclusion and the disclaimer. Everything listed above represents items that I personally selected with great care throughout the year — but my definition of “good products” is entirely subjective. These items are simply what best fit me, not necessarily what will fit everyone. If anything here gives you even a little inspiration, then that alone makes this article worthwhile. There is no such thing as a perfect product, but I hope this 2025 favorites roundup offers you a broader reference range for your future purchases.

Title: Nvidia's bumpy November
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-november-challenges-google-michael-burry-ai-bubble-fears-2025-11

Every time Brent D. Griffiths publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nvidia's sterling armor was dented this month. After years of meteoric success, the chipmaker and its CEO Jensen Huang have increasingly found themselves playing defense — an unusual position for the company. Nvidia headed into the month with its stock price at an all-time high, bolstered by increasing AI spending from some of its major Big Tech customers like Meta, Microsoft, and Google. Huang was hot off of Nvidia's GTC conference in Washington, where he dismissed any concerns of an AI bubble and sounded jubilant. But over the course of the month, which saw Nvidia shed 11% of its value, the chipmaker has gone from smashing earnings and alleviating Wall Street's AI bubble fears to becoming the poster boy of what some analysts view as a company on an unsustainable path. Nvidia has also had to fend off short-sellers and the growing threat of Google, picking up some bruises along the way. Big names, including SoftBank and Peter Thiel, cashed out on the Wall Street darling that had became the world's first $4 trillion market cap company mere months ago. SoftBank announced it fully exited its Nvidia position, selling $5.8 billion in shares to bet on OpenAI. And while its CFO stressed it had "nothing to do with Nvidia itself," the move didn't exactly dispel the ongoing AI bubble talk. Nvidia defiantly pushed back on any investor skittishness when it released its third-quarter earnings on November 19, surpassing analysts' already lofty expectations — no small feat — at a time when concerns about the AI bubble were once again creeping up. "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," Huang told analysts on a call following the results. "From our vantage point, we see something very different." But while shares rallied in after-hours trading following the results, markets did a U-turn the following day as hand-wringing over ballooning tech valuations and spending continued. Behind closed doors, Huang privately told employees in remarks first reported by Business Insider that "the market did not appreciate" Nvidia's "incredible" quarter. Facing sky-high expectations and the position of being a bellwether for the AI industry, Huang described the chipmaker as being in a somewhat no-win situation. "If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there's an AI bubble. If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble," Huang said during an all-hands meeting. It didn't take long for things to get a bit choppy for the chipmaker. Shares of Nvidia fell after The Information reported that Google was engaged in talks with Meta to provide the social network billions worth of the tech giant's own advanced chips. While Nvidia's chips have long been the gold standard in the AI race, a hot commodity used by tech giants and startups to train and run LLMs and chatbots, the news suggested that the chipmaker's market share might be under threat. With Google now eyeing Nvidia's lunch, the market digested a possible future where Nvidia may no longer be the star attraction. Nvidia's market losses following the news appeared to be Google's gain, with its parent company Alphabet now positioned to join the $4 trillion club that Nvidia started. And in a move that raised some eyebrows, Nvidia released a mostly defiant statement that praised Google's success but said Nvidia's chips are "a generation ahead of the industry." The developments acted as fuel for Michael Burry of "The Big Short" fame, who has become increasingly vocal about voicing his doubts about Nvidia. Burry, who has a particularly dour view of the AI industry, spent much of the month questioning the longevity of Nvidia's chips, its stock dilution, and its circular, "give-and-take deals" in AI. The investor recently leaned into online writing and labeled Nvidia as the Cisco of the AI bubble era in one of his first Substack posts. "And once again there is a Cisco at the center of it all, with the picks and shovels for all and the expansive vision to go with it," Burry wrote. "Its name is Nvidia." The chipmaker didn't take the criticism lying down. In a note to Wall Street sell-side analysts, a copy of which was obtained by Business Insider, Nvidia took exception to Burry's claims, stating that he appeared to have "incorrectly" made some of his calculations. The memo also pushed back against views that Nvidia is too entangled in circular financial arrangements with some of its customers. "First, Nvidia's strategic investments represent a small share of Nvidia's revenue and an even smaller share of approximately $1T raised each year across global private capital markets," the memo said, adding, "The companies in Nvidia's strategic investment portfolio predominantly generate revenue from third-party customers, not from Nvidia." Burry called Nvidia's response "disappointing" and disclosed that he "continues to own puts" on Nvidia. While November undoubtedly turned up the heat on Nvidia, the chipmaker continues to be the world's most valuable company by market cap and its shares have slightly rebounded in recent days, closing up 1.37% on Wednesday. The world's largest tech companies rely on Nvidia's chips and have committed to spend billions and billions on the latest generation. CEO Jensen Huang has said sales of its latest Blackwell chips have been "off the charts." Nvidia's CFO, Colette Kress, told analysts earlier this month that the company is on track to bring in "half a trillion" in AI chip orders during the combined 2025-2026 period — a number that she said "will grow" as more deals are struck. While Nvidia's bruising back half of the month is a reminder that even AI royalty can see its crown threatened, Huang had some words for the doubters during the company's earnings call. "As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator," he said. "We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." Jump to

Title: Nasdaq seeks SEC nod to lift IBIT options cap to one million contracts

BTC’s V-shaped recovery meets Nasdaq’s IBIT options expansion. IBIT options expansion provides 40× more room for Bitcoin derivatives exposure, boosting liquidity, but persistent market fear raises questions. BTC is showing a V-shaped recovery, reclaiming $92k, but full reversal is still uncertain as options leverage peaks and resistance levels loom. The Q4 market cycle is prompting investors to reconsider the “store of value” narrative. From DATs losing purchasing power to ETFs bleeding cash, and big institutions selling to protect their balance sheets, Bitcoin [BTC] conviction is being tested. BlackRock’s BTC holdings are a clear example. According to BitBo, the firm has offloaded roughly 30,000 BTC since the October crash. And it’s not just their direct holdings. BlackRock’s BTC ETF (IBIT) logged more than $3 billion in outflows in November alone. Source: BitBo In short, institutional conviction in BlackRock took a hit this cycle. Yet, the latest Nasdaq–SEC filing looks like an attempt to reboot momentum around IBIT. According to the filing, Nasdaq wants to raise IBIT’s options contract limit from 25k to 1 million, marking a 400% jump. Simply put, that’s 40× more room for derivatives exposure in Bitcoin, putting IBIT in the same conversation as the “Magnificent Seven” in terms of options depth. But the question is: Is the timing right? BTC has bounced back to $90k, yet “fear” still dominates the market. ETFs haven’t fully rebounded either. In this context, does Nasdaq’s move give IBIT room for serious derivatives flows, or is it just another high-risk trade? The market reaction to the news is clear on the charts. According to CoinGlass, Bitcoin’s Options Open Interest (OI) jumped about $4 billion in a single day, hitting $62 billion. That’s a clear sign derivatives activity is picking up, likely boosted by the expanded IBIT options limits. The impact on Bitcoin? Pretty clear. BTC is riding the bullish momentum from yesterday’s 3.51% rally, trying to reclaim the $92k level. In fact, this marks BTC’s first V-shaped recovery in nearly a month. Source : TradingView (BTC/USDT) However, a full reversal isn’t on the cards yet. In early November, BTC failed to break the $110k ceiling, forming two lower lows, the latest around $80k. In this context, breaking $94k would be the first step toward a vertical expansion. Meanwhile, options leverage is heating up, while the SEC has yet to rule on the IBIT filing. Still, the market’s reaction is already evident. As BTC nears resistance, how this leverage plays out will serve as a crucial gauge for traders. If BTC holds above current levels, the 1 million contract expansion could pave the way for deeper liquidity. Otherwise, excessive leverage could make BTC prone to volatility, turning the expansion into a high-risk trade.

Title: The new plan for Urban Planning Authorities, the Eurogroup on K.M.’s agenda with Weber, CVC sells marinas in a €1.5 billion deal, the Church and the auction
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2025/11/27/the-new-plan-for-urban-planning-authorities-the-eurogroup-on-k-m-s-agenda-with-weber-cvc-sells-marinas-in-a-e1-5-billion-deal-the-church-and-the-auction/

Hello, I find political news today less interesting than two other issues that are much more serious. The first concerns that tragic accident last Friday in Pagrati, in which an 84-year-old driver hit and killed a 75-year-old woman who was walking with her 30-year-old daughter with disabilities. When, finally, in this country will elderly people undergo serious tests in order to renew — or NOT renew — their driver’s license? It is time to put an end to an issue that literally kills innocent people. The second concerns the sudden work stoppage by STASY, due to a tragic accident that occurred in one of the company’s engine sheds in Piraeus. The work stoppage on the metro and tram paralyzed all of Athens yesterday afternoon and caused hardship to hundreds of thousands of citizens. The incident is tragic, but there is a prosecutor and an investigating judge looking into it and, if there is responsibility, it will be assigned through the Justice system. What is gained, and by whom, from making all of Athens suffer? Will working conditions change because of yesterday’s strike? Since the Thessaloniki International Fair, Stavros Papastavrou and Dimitris Papastergiou sat down to design how the reform announced by K.M. at the Fair will be implemented — specifically, the transfer of Urban Planning Offices from municipalities to the Cadastre. The plan has been prepared, will be presented today to the Cabinet, will begin to be implemented on a pilot basis in 2026, and fully by 2027. What it practically provides: integration of the Urban Planning Offices into the Cadastre Offices, both in substance and in the information system, and of course a reduction in physical contact points, through the digitalization of procedures. My understanding is that there will be one local Cadastre office per regional capital and one central office per region. Also, with the digital pool of cases, when one Urban Planning Office has a heavy workload, another with less can handle the work, without requiring contact with the engineer, the citizen, etc. Today at 20:00 K.M. has a scheduled dinner with the president of the EPP, Manfred Weber, who is in Athens with the candidate prime minister of the state of Baden-Württemberg, Manuel Hagel. Under other circumstances the dinner would be social in nature, but here it is obvious that K.M. wants to lobby on the issue of the Eurogroup and the prospect of the EPP supporting Pierre’s candidacy, who has just returned from Berlin. With K.M. at the central Athens restaurant will be Chatzidakis, who is also vice-president of the EPP, and ND’s Secretary for International Relations, Tasos Chatzivasileiou, who gets along well with the Germans. I asked my source who was describing the plan whether the matter of the Urban Planning Offices will stir up local reactions, as happened with the Hellenic Post. “Look, there are municipalities that react, but we do not want to put the mayors in opposition. There are also municipalities that don’t want to have anything to do with Urban Planning Offices,” he told me. As for the staff of the Urban Planning Offices, those who wish will be given the right to remain in the new structure, but if they do not want to, they will be absorbed into other services. I understand that perhaps even before year-end there may be an agreement between the government and industrialists on the issue of electricity and the subsidy that SEV is insistently demanding. After the issue of collective agreements, President Spyros Theodoropoulos has set course for an agreement and is in open communication with both K.M. and Chatzidakis. If I can make an estimate, the agreement will probably be somewhat less than what the industrialists wanted, but still—better than nothing… At the end of the week ND’s leadership will sit down to draft the plan for the party’s pre-congresses, which will pave the way for the party congress after Easter. There is information circulating that the start may be in Patras in the first ten days of December, but there is also the view that there is no point in doing anything before the holidays, as the party mechanism has already been mobilized one way or another due to internal elections. Therefore, the start may come in January, while the cities that will host the at least four pre-congresses will also be finalized. And we move on to market news with an interesting story about a fresh deal in the making. According to information, CVC is launching a process to sell D-Marin, the company that owns and manages marinas. It is a major deal, as the price is estimated to reach €1.5 billion. The Greek interest lies in the fact that included in the “package” coming to market are the marinas of Zea, Pylos, Lefkada, and the large marina in Gouvia, Corfu. According to the same sources, the sale process is taking place abroad. D-Marin owns 26 marinas in nine countries — Greece, Malta, Turkey, Croatia, Italy, France, Spain, Montenegro, and Albania. They sweated, but they are approaching the finish line. This concerns Masoutis and the acquisition of Kritikos, which barring surprises will be finalized by year-end. Initial estimates pointed to October, but it turned out not to be a walk in the park. The deal creates the third-largest player in the supermarket market in terms of turnover. Competitors argue that it will take time until the new entity is well organized and operates smoothly. Many shares of British gambling companies “went into the bucket” as the Labour government — making a dramatic effort to increase state revenue — decided to raise taxes on online gambling. The Remote Gaming Duty (RGD), imposed on online gambling, will rise to 40% in April 2026 from today’s 21%.Finance Minister Rachel Reeves aims to add over £1 billion annually to the state budget as a result of the new levies. However, the tax increase leads to a significant rise in costs for gambling companies, especially those offering online casino, betting, etc., with consequences for their suppliers and the entire sector’s chain. This may reduce profit margins, especially for smaller companies; some may be forced to downsize or restructure their activities through mergers or even leaving the market. Analysts believe there will be a drop in investment in the sector, as the increased tax burden makes the market less attractive.In this climate, the most affected shares were those of companies with high exposure to the British market. A characteristic example is Evoke (888, William Hill, etc.), which dropped 14%, while Entain (Ladbrokes, Coral, etc.) managed to absorb the pressure, and Flutter (Paddy Power, Betfair, FanDuel, etc.) closed in positive territory as it has significant presence in the U.S. Intralot, now controlled by Bally’s Interactive, was hit hard on the Athens Stock Exchange (-17%, at €0.92) due to its significant dependence on the UK market, since 60% of the new entity’s activities take place in the UK, where, among other things, it operates the highly popular online brand Monopoly Casino. Analysts consider the price of €80 million that OPAP will pay for the State Lotteries to be fair, if not advantageous. The company won the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) tender for the 12-year concession of the exclusive management rights of the State Lotteries. It will pay a lump sum of €80 million, as well as 30% of gross profit annually, with a minimum guaranteed annual payment of €20 million. In April 2026, the current contract for the Lotteries held by Hellenic Lotteries expires, so OPAP managed to keep them in its portfolio until 2038. It is also noteworthy that OPAP will now have 100% of Hellenic Lotteries S.A., the company that has been running the State Lotteries to date, since Scientific Games is selling its 16.5% stake. Yesterday we also had the management’s conference call for the nine-month results, but no news emerged, and analysts and the market now await updates on the Allwyn–OPAP merger at the upcoming Capital Markets Update. The legal saga of Folli Follie continues, and at the latest hearing (November 25), objections were filed by the defendants — D. Koutsolioutsos, Aik. Koutsolioutsou and I. Begeitis — against the participation of shareholders supporting the accusation for fraud and forgery. Similar objections were filed against the participation of HCAP and EFKA. All objections will be decided at the next hearing. Regarding the FF request, the court announced it will give the floor only after its decision on the guilt or innocence of the defendants — that is, at the end of the trial. Despite the fact that this procedural order is provided by law and was followed at first instance, in practice, for cases such as this, it amounts to a form of “penalty” against the damaged party, who ends up being heard last, when everything has already been decided. The trial was again adjourned, to December 18, 2025. It is worth noting that the hearing at the Court of Appeal was originally set to begin on April 9, 2025, but since then it has been constantly postponed — from adjournment to suspension and back again. Time passes, the case drags on, and the administration of justice is tested by its own delays. Early this morning, at the five-star September City Resort Spa & Conference operated by Hotel Brain, in Pylaia, Thessaloniki, the entry of Telis Mystakidis into PAOK BC (KAE PAOK) is officially announced. The entrance into the new era begins with an “injection” of 5.5 million euros from the new major shareholder, while immediately afterwards a large share-capital increase will follow. To make all this happen, an extraordinary General Assembly of PAOK BC shareholders has already been convened for December 17, as required by the institutional framework, with the main item being the election of a new Board of Directors. This process constitutes the final formal step for the full and clean transition to the new ownership structure. It is well-known that the Church of Greece owns large real-estate holdings throughout the country. Now, however, these are the reason it appears on the lists of electronic auctions—albeit indirectly. To avoid misunderstanding: this is not a hammer due to debts, nor is it being hunted by servicers. As the column learns, it is found—formally—in the position of debtor, with a private individual as the party initiating the auction, because she and the Church are co-owners, each holding 50%, of a “prime” plot in Thessaloniki. In this auction, scheduled for 28 January 2026, in the position of “defendant–co-owner–party against whom the auction is directed,” appears the Legal Entity of Public Law under the name “Church of Greece,” headquartered on Iasiou Street in Athens. The entire procedure is based on a recent decision of the Multi-Member Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki, ordering the partition of the plot. It is a complete and buildable plot of 310 sq.m. in the municipality of Thessaloniki, on Polyxenis Antoniou Street, at the borders of the historic center and Ano Poli, near the Ministry of Macedonia–Thrace. Among the scenarios examined in the valuation report was its division, which was not advantageous, while the preferred solution proposed was either selling it as a whole or exploiting it by constructing a multi-story building and distributing the resulting horizontal properties. And so we arrived at the auction, which will take place with a starting price of €402,000. As for the ownership titles, they go as far back as a Royal Decree from 1952. In New York, Petros Pappas continues to be one of the few Greek constants closely monitored by the funds in the dry-bulk market. And it’s not only the financial results of the third quarter of 2025—net income $18.5 million, EBITDA $73.6 million, and an average daily charter rate of $16,634/day—that drew attention. Pappas’ philosophy continues to be read like a manual of financial discipline: the 19th consecutive dividend, steadily $0.11/share (with cumulative returns of $13.12/share since 2021), and above all, dedication to value creation through streamlining the share base. There aren’t many Greek shipowners talked about at trading desks for their buybacks, but Star Bulk has already “burned” about 5 million shares, investing $82.1 million, while another “wallet” of $91.4 million remains available. On Wall Street, this translates as follows: “Pappas knows what his stock is worth and buys when others hesitate.” It is the classic recipe of value operators who are not afraid of volatility, as long as the balance sheet can withstand it. At the same time, Pappas does not miss the chance to buy tonnage when prices are right. The three Kamsarmax newbuilding resales from a Chinese shipyard, delivering in Q3 2026, are read by analysts as a targeted bet on the fleet tightness ahead. The age fatigue of the global bulk fleet is now a given, while regulatory uncertainty—from U.S.–China fee measures to the postponed decision on the IMO Net Zero Framework—works more in favor of strong balance sheets than against them. The week in shipbuilding confirms a pattern that, on Wall Street, is now considered structural: Greek shipowners act as the most consistent source of demand for new tonnage in sectors with different cycles and risk profiles. In bulkers, Atlantic Bulk Carriers is methodically expanding its footprint with four new supramaxes in China—continuation of an order sequence reflecting confidence in future freight rates despite volatility. Pricing at $33.75 million per unit places the company in the “value buyers” zone, exploiting stable construction costs before new inflationary pressures appear. The moves by Danaos and Oceanbulk in container ships reveal a parallel reading of the market: feeder orders remain strong, as supply chains are being reconfigured and regional feedering gains importance. The fact that Danaos is closing a six-vessel 1,800-teu series at a yard specializing in LPG carriers shows the Chinese industry is seeking more flexible capacity use. Meanwhile, Oceanbulk’s two 3,100-teu ships indicate that Greek owners are operating in the “mid-size box” category, where the greatest supply–demand balance is expected after 2026. In the tanker market, VLCC orders have increased in intensity and frequency. Maran Tankers returns with four new vessels at Hanwha Ocean, while a parallel European order at HD Hyundai shipyards shows the crude-oil market is renewing a fleet that has aged faster than the historical average. Prices at $128–130 million indicate that shipyards have regained bargaining power and owners are pricing in resilient earnings over the next four years. The appearance of two LNG carriers in HD KSOE’s books is the exception proving the rule: the LNG market remains conservative with new orders. Workings and backstage movements at the headquarters of the International Maritime Organization, where Vassilis Kikilias represents the country ahead of the electoral process for Category A, in which Greece aims for first place. Given that the IMO is the maritime arm of the UN, what I can tell you is that in the days before the elections, interesting diplomatic games take place with votes and balances as bargaining chips. The Greek delegation has a clear goal: to remind partners of Greece’s role in international shipping—not as a given, but as a responsibility it wants to continue serving. In private meetings, the minister repeated the spirit of his speech: respect for procedures, commitment to cooperation, and a discreet but clear reminder that “Greeks are people of the sea.” The three-member delegation of the Single Resolution Board (SRB) in Athens, led by the well-dressed Czech gentleman and the exceptionally discreet Asian-origin lady, did not hide their enthusiasm after their meetings with the managements of Greek banks. SRB visits are never “courtesy calls” or filled with pleasantries. They arrive with a pre-prepared questionnaire seeking gaps in MREL capital adequacy, the ability for rapid asset transfers, and the readiness of IT systems to operate under emergency conditions. Particular attention this year was paid to the cross-border activities of Greek banks. It appears the inspection results were absolutely satisfactory—something they reportedly did not hide in their final assessment. Aegean’s market capitalization reached €1.3 billion, as it closely follows the trajectory of major European airlines hoping for an end to the war in Ukraine. The European aviation index Stoxx Europe Total Market Airlines recorded another rise yesterday (+1.91%) and on a weekly basis its gains exceeded +5.40%. The index is composed of shares of 10 airlines (Ryanair, IAG, Lufthansa, EasyJet, Air France–KLM, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Wizzair, Finnair, Enter Air, and Norse Atlantic), all of which always trade at valuations lower than justified by their figures, as the sector is extremely sensitive to climate or geopolitical shifts. Over the past week—since even faint echoes of peace have been heard—there has been significant capital inflow into the aviation sector, and Aegean is benefiting from this trend. On 19 November, Aegean’s share price was €13.14; yesterday we saw it at €14.60. In last Monday’s session, 158 thousand shares changed hands; on Tuesday the number nearly doubled to 257 thousand, and yesterday, Wednesday, exceeded 100 thousand shares. AEGEAN continues to stand out for its cash position, holding €379 million in net cash, while implementing an ambitious investment plan that will allow it to spread its wings even to India. High-level international delegations have recently been visiting Sunlight’s factory in Xanthi. Recently, a French delegation led by the French Consul General in Thessaloniki visited the facility, while a few weeks earlier, there had been a large visit of Defense Attachés from 23 countries across 5 continents. The close timing and nature of these two visits are not considered coincidental. France, as the second-largest market for industrial batteries in Europe, represents a strategic market for Sunlight, which simultaneously maintains a long-standing international presence in the market for energy solutions for defense applications. The Greek multinational group Sunlight is rapidly strengthening its role in the new international environment, where energy independence, security, and technological innovation are acquiring decisive importance. Excluding Intralot, which we mentioned above (-17.27% at €0.92) and its issues with the British budget, which dragged down all shares of the Kokkalis Group in its decline, yesterday’s session was a victory for balanced growth. The sixth consecutive upward session pushed the General Index above 2,100 points (2,106.9, +0.94%) with increased trading value of €311.55 million, including €70.6 million in pre-agreed block trades. Banks performed well and raised the pace, but the rise spread across almost all blue-chip stocks, with a clear protagonist being the DEI (Public Power Corporation) share (+2.29% at €7.19), for which investment firms are publishing a series of positive reports these days. Eurobank (+3.62% at €3.52) had many supporters yesterday, and trading in the stock approached €70 million (€49.6 million in blocks). National Bank (+3.38% at €13.06) and Piraeus (+2.31% at €7.19) also raised expectations high, while Alpha (+0.86% at €3.64) continues upward steadily without spikes. Notable is the performance of TITAN, which again reached the price of €45.6 (+1.22%). The mere publication of the news immediately knocked NVIDIA’s stock down by -6%. However, the consequences are broader. Zuckerberg’s Meta (Facebook) announced that it chose Google’s TPU chips instead of Nvidia’s GPUs. In doing so, it broke the monopoly that Nvidia had built in AI infrastructure. Nvidia immediately issued a press release expressing its “enthusiasm” for “Google’s success,” while simultaneously losing $250 billion in market capitalization. At the same time, it reminded that “we continue to supply Google,” since Google still depends on Nvidia’s H100 and GB200 chips for the most demanding AI tasks. Nvidia did not want to attack its best customer directly, despite its “infidelity.” For this reason, it made sure to remind the market that its own chips offer “greater performance and flexibility.” It aimed to warn every other hyperscaler and every company considering following Meta’s example. But for the rest of the market, the message is clear: Nvidia’s dominance is being challenged. Its stock lost 11% in ten days. Google’s TPUs are cheaper, may be limited in certain functions, but competition has knocked on the door of costly Nvidia, and this is just the beginning of another war at the heart of Artificial Intelligence. The submission of the 2026 Budget by the Labor government in the UK targets all those who have chosen London as a taxation base for their income. Savers and property income earners will face a straight tax increase of 2 percentage points on income from interest, rents, and dividends. This means that taxes on savings income start at 22%, rise to 42%, and reach 47%. Dividend tax rates rise to 10.75% for basic-rate taxpayers and go up to 35.75% at higher scales. Chancellor Reeves has budgeted an additional £500 million per year in tax revenues from savings and property income, and an additional £1.2 billion from dividends. For decades, the London market attracted income-focused investors precisely because of the large number of companies paying generous dividends every year. Clearly, these developments also concern Greeks who have purchased apartments in London to collect rent, as they now face a new headache. The tax increase comes in a context of rising inflation, high living costs, and increasing financial pressures. Explore related questions

U.S. bond markets remain steady despite speculation that White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett could replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair in May. Hassett’s reputation for favoring rate cuts has sparked concerns that the dollar could weaken. Betting markets show rising odds for Hassett, while short-term yields dipped briefly before rebounding. (Source: Reuters) The dollar and Fed funds futures have seen minimal impact, even as investors price in an 83% chance of a quarter-point rate cut in December. Hassett, a former Fed senior economist, is considered aligned with President Trump, who favors faster reductions in interest rates. The market reaction may be muted because Hassett was already seen as the frontrunner. The field of candidates for the Fed chair has narrowed to a handful of finalists. These include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. On betting site Polymarket, Hassett’s odds have risen to 53%, Waller holds 22%, and Warsh is at 16%. Investors largely discount any risk to Fed independence, regardless of who takes the helm. Experts emphasize that the chair guides the committee, but the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee ultimately decides on rates. The path of interest rates will continue to depend heavily on fresh U.S. economic data, including labor reports and the administration’s trade and tariff policies. Kevin Hassett may be seen as less independent compared to other candidates, which creates some risk to the dollar and the Treasury yield curve. However, his traditional economics background could limit aggressive dovish moves. Experts caution that Hassett would likely not fully align with political pressures, even if he favors rate cuts more than Powell. The Fed eased rates by a quarter percentage point in both September and October, leaving the Fed funds rate at 3.75–4%. Hassett previously supported a “slow and steady” approach to rate cuts and emphasized that Fed policy must remain independent of political influence. Analysts believe fears of a politicized Fed are overdone, noting Hassett would struggle to push the committee toward aggressive dovishness.

Title: Americans in Ireland think of home at Thanksgiving: ‘There are troubled times over there’

One American couple’s “most memorable” Thanksgiving was when they got caught up in the Dublin riots this time two years ago while out for dinner. Tania Etter from Pennsylvania and her husband Marcus from San Francisco moved to Dublin seven years ago as part of his job. Thanksgiving, which Americans – including those living in Ireland – celebrate today, is his favourite holiday. “American holidays are very commercialised whereas there’s nothing about Thanksgiving other than eat, drink, family and sport,” he says. Thanksgiving has nothing of the “pretentiousness” of other holidays, he adds. Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November and dates back to 1621 when European settlers, or Pilgrims as they were known, were having trouble growing enough food. Native Americans taught them how to grow crops and the Pilgrims invited them to a feast as a thank-you. The couple were attending a Thanksgiving event with other Americans when the riots broke out in November 2023 and they couldn’t get home. “We walked south of Ranelagh before we finally found a taxi man who we could convince to take us home,” he recalled. “It was an adventure,” added Ms Etter. [ Meet the Americans moving to Ireland for a better lifeOpens in new window ] They have a tradition of putting messages in a stuffed animal known as Terry the Thanksgiving turkey that sits as a table centrepiece. Family and friends write messages of what they are thankful for. The messages become the tail feathers and after dinner, the turkey is plucked and messages read aloud. Marcus is thankful for his Irish citizenship which he received this year and their recent move to their home in Blackrock, south Dublin. “I just went back to America for the first time in four years for our business trip. I can absolutely and unequivocally say I do not miss it,” he said. He misses his family at home but Teams and Zoom calls make it “easier”. This year they will celebrate with a pre-prepared meal at home with their dogs. The Late Late Toy Show has become one of their holiday season traditions. “Our view is you can’t just be American and hold on to all your Americanisms. You’re living in a new culture, a new world, a new society, you need to adopt that.” Molly Coyle Shibley moved to Ireland in 2019. She is grateful to live here but feels “guilty” for family still in the US. Originally from Massachusetts, Coyle Shibley settled in Rathfarnham, south Dublin with her husband Tom while pregnant with their first child Nora after he was offered a job in Dublin. “I’m very grateful to be in Ireland for different reasons every year,” she said. “Last year, we bought a house. This year my husband and daughter’s citizenship applications were approved and I’m applying for mine.” Ms Shibley celebrates with the same group of friends every year. “They have seen my daughter grow up, they’re my family away from home.” Margie O’Rourke has been living in Ireland since 1987 and settled in St Margaret’s in north Dublin, where her husband, who she met in her hometown of Philadelphia, is from. “The major thing with Thanksgiving is family so it’s a weird experience being away from family,” she said. “Most people here are completely unaware it’s Thanksgiving.” She is thankful for her good health and that of her husband and family, and grateful for friends and little things like “the green grass and a cup of tea”. “It took me 10 years to settle here but life is good. There are troubled times over there [in the US],” she said. “Thanksgiving – it’s tradition and it’s part of me.” [ US students drawn to Ireland struck by hard realities of rental marketOpens in new window ] © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

The filing, dated November 21, 2025, seeks to raise the limit from 250,000 contracts to 1,000,000 contracts. It would place IBIT options in the same tier as major equities and ETFs such as Apple, NVIDIA, and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF. “The proposed rule change seeks to dramatically increase the position and exercise limits for options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) from 250,000 to 1,000,000 contracts,” the filing reads, adding the current cap is “restrictive and hampers legitimate trading and hedging strategies.” A higher limit would allow institutional traders and market makers to establish larger positions, thereby increasing market depth and liquidity for the product. "This will allow institutions to build more interesting structured products for IBIT, increasing the total possible amount of capital that can be allocated to the Bitcoin ETFs," Lai Yuen, investment analyst at Fisher8 Capital, told Decrypt. "This should be good for long-term IBIT flows." “This is already the second time Nasdaq has requested an increase in IBIT’s options position limits,” Tim Sun, Senior Researcher at HashKey Group, told Decrypt. The move showcases that institutional demand for Bitcoin derivatives continues to expand as larger players seek to increase their Bitcoin allocations, Sun added. The filing requests an exemption to eliminate limits entirely for customized 'FLEX' options that are physically delivered. This move would “align IBIT with other major commodity-based ETFs and help pull trading activity away from opaque over-the-counter markets,” per the filing. It also cites IBIT's market capitalization of $86.2 billion and an average daily volume of 44.6 million shares as of September 22, 2025, as key factors supporting the proposed change. The ISE proposal is subject to SEC approval, with a public comment period open until December 17, 2025. “IBIT is now the biggest bitcoin options market in the world by open interest,” Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, wrote in a Wednesday tweet. “At last, IBIT options is finally getting the treatment it deserves. Institutional vol is finally here,” Jeff Park of Bitwise Invest Advisors tweeted on Wednesday. The scale of this change is “more modest than most headlines suggest,” Derek Lim, head of research at crypto market-making firm Caladan, told Decrypt. With BlackRock holding over $71 billion in Bitcoin, the increased options limit would allow roughly $5.3 billion, representing about 8% of that total value, which is a standard, conservative practice for large ETFs," Lim added. While the changes have yet to take effect, the adjustment signals that Bitcoin trading is shifting from purely speculative to allocation-driven behavior, the HashKey analyst noted. Despite no immediate impact on Bitcoin’s short-term price, Sun explained it would allow institutions to build Bitcoin positions in a “lower-risk and more controlled manner.” From a volatility standpoint, Lim noted that realized volatility is likely to compress 50 to 100 basis points over the next six to 18 months, which “can translate to marginally higher prices through lower risk premia.” Bitcoin’s rally from $70,000 to $110,000 earlier this year occurred amid declining volatility. That negative correlation marks a fundamental shift, Lim noted, suggesting that if the Nasdaq’s proposed changes come into effect, Bitcoin will increasingly trade like a macro asset and would accelerate this transition. In a related development, BlackRock continues to accumulate Bitcoin exposure in its in-house funds. A separate Wednesday filing revealed its Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio increased its IBIT holdings by 14% in Q3 to $155.8 million. Bitcoin hit $91,500 on Wednesday and is up 5% over 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

Title: Nasdaq seeks to ‘super-size’ option limits for BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/nasdaq-ibit-bitcoin-etf-options-1-million
Time Published: 2025-11-27T03:20:26Z

The push from the Nasdaq to increase option limits for the BlackRock Bitcoin fund shows Bitcoin markets are “breaking out of their training wheels.” The Nasdaq International Securities Exchange has filed a proposal with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to increase the position limits for options on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund to 1 million. Position limits exist to prevent any one investor from controlling too many option contracts on the same stock, thereby reducing the risk of manipulative schemes that could affect prices, according to the notice and copy of the filing from the SEC on Wednesday. The Nasdaq has requested in its Nov. 13 filing to increase the BlackRock ETF limit from 250,000 contracts to 1 million, as the exchange has seen an ongoing increase in demand for IBIT. A lower limit would impede trading activity and the strategies of investors, such as the use of effective hedging vehicles or an income-generating strategy. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Vincent Liu, the chief investment officer at quantitative trading firm Kronos Research, said the SEC is likely to approve the proposal because “these adjustments are routine once an asset proves it can handle real volume. If approved, expect thicker order books, tighter spreads, and a more efficient options market.” Nasdaq previously filed to raise the limit from 25,000 to 250,000 in January because IBIT was well above the trading volume minimum of 100 million shares. Liu said this current push from the Nasdaq to “super-size IBIT option limits shows Bitcoin markets breaking out of their training wheels.” Related: S&P downgrades USDT’s dollar peg rating to lowest score “Bigger bands mean bigger players can finally hedge, size up, and sharpen price discovery. A clear sign that crypto derivatives are shifting from niche to necessary,” he said. Meanwhile, Adam Livingston, a Bitcoin (BTC) analyst and author, said in a series of X posts on Wednesday that the move by Nasdaq places BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF into the same category as the “largest, most liquid equities on Earth,” such as tech giants Apple and Microsoft. “They did it because the market has already decided Bitcoin is a mega-cap asset, whether Washington likes it or not. This is the moment every banker secretly feared,” he said.

Title: XRP Steps Into Its ETF Moment — Analyst Is Betting On A Rally Bigger Than Bitcoin’s

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures and evolves, a new narrative is gaining traction that positions XRP for an upcoming institutional-driven surge that could redefine market expectations. With momentum building around XRP exchange-traded funds, one prominent analyst now believes the asset could be on the verge of a rally so large it may outperform Bitcoin’s own ETF-driven surge. XRP is entering its ETF chapter, and the scale of what’s coming could make Bitcoin look small. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull mentioned on X that early players like Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin, and Canary Funds are already live with their XRP products. Meanwhile, the real power players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and the other giants haven’t even filed for an XRP spot ETF yet, which shows this is just a warm-up. The heavyweights haven’t even stepped into the arena, and the initial institutional capital is already flowing. Spot ETFs were highly beneficial for BTC, which triggered a trillion-dollar shockwave that attracted Wall Street institutions and momentum traders who couldn’t ignore the access. According to Xfinancebull, XRP is a different beast, with functional utility, real-world adoption, and banking infrastructure already built out across Japan and Asia. The capital that will soon flood into XRP via ETFs won’t just speculate, but it will stay. When a fraction of over $80 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM) from these initial titans begins to rotate into XRP, the inflows could be significant. This is cold, hard math that is about to unlock high levels of liquidity and historically repeat the move on a larger scale. “The XRP spot ETF ignition is not coming, but it is already here. If you missed the Bitcoin momentum move, don’t miss this one,” Xfinancebull noted. An analyst known as RipBullWinkle has also highlighted that Bitcoin has leaked $151 million, while XRP led all inflows with $164 million. That’s not random, it’s institutions reallocating with intention into assets built for settlement and speed. When powerhouses like Franklin Templeton and Grayscale pull over $130 million into XRP on day one, it confirms where the institutional smart money is going. Bitcoin and altcoins are reacting sharply to momentary declines after the brief pullback. TerraHaberTr has stated that BTC has reclaimed the $87,000 level, and if momentum continues at this pace, BTC will target $90,000 and $100,000 levels. On the altcoin side, the recovery is happening even faster, and altcoins that have experienced deep dips may start to gain strength. Meanwhile, XRP is gaining traction as it pushes back above $2.20. If the move continues, XRP could reach the $3.00 region. Overall, opportunities have continued to emerge across major altcoins.

My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: Ethereum ETFs pull $175mln in two days, yet ETH stays weak — What’s wrong?

Is the market sleepwalking into a major surprise? On 24 November, ETH ETFs saw $96.6 million in inflows, with BlackRock contributing $92.6 million. On 25 November, ETH ETFs added another $78.6 million. RSI and MACD point to a short-term bearish trend, but these signals may be temporary noise rather than long-term weakness. At a time when the market is buzzing with new altcoin ETF launches, Ethereum’s quiet yet powerful momentum is being overlooked. The world’s largest altcoin ETF – the Ethereum Spot ETF – has been steadily gaining strength ever since it debuted in the same year as the historic Bitcoin [BTC] ETF rollout. And the latest numbers show that investor confidence in Ethereum [ETH] is far from fading. On the 24th of November, Ethereum Spot ETFs logged a strong $96.6 million in net inflows, with BlackRock alone accounting for $92.6 million, marking its first inflow in two weeks. Well, the momentum didn’t stop there. A day later, ETH ETFs attracted another $78.6 million, led by Fidelity’s FETH with $47.5 million, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA at $46.2 million, and Grayscale’s ETH adding $8.3 million. While most other issuers recorded zero activity, Grayscale’s ETHE continued to face pressure, witnessing $23.3 million in outflows, according to Farside Investors. However, despite the strong inflows into Ethereum ETFs, the asset itself continues to battle a difficult price environment. At the time the latest ETF inflows were recorded, Ethereum was trading around $2,913.41, still unable to reclaim the $3,000 mark after falling more than 30% in a month, according to CoinMarketCap. This weakness stood in sharp contrast to the asset’s price action when ETH ETFs first went live on the 23rd of July 2024, when Ethereum closed at $3,418.61. But the current struggle isn’t about Ethereum alone. The broader crypto market has been under pressure due to a mix of macro events, including a U.S. government shutdown, shifting expectations around Fed rate cuts, and overall risk-off sentiment. Technical indicators also reflect this short-term turbulence. In fact, the RSI and MACD point toward a bearish phase, though these signals could be temporary noise rather than signs of a deeper structural shift. Source: Trading View Interestingly, this period of weakness has actually pulled major Ethereum whales back into the market. After ETH rebounded nearly 9% from its recent low of $2,623, whales became noticeably active again, breaking a month-long downtrend. On-chain data showed dormant wallets suddenly moving large amounts of ETH. Now, while Ethereum battles its own volatility, the broader ETF race is heating up. In a fresh development, VanEck has filed for a Spot Binance [BNB] ETF. According to recent SEC filings, the VanEck BNB ETF (VBNB) will list on Nasdaq and hold BNB directly, tracking the MarketVector BNB Index. The fund will not enable staking at launch, though VanEck noted that any future staking features would be handled through third-party providers with prior notice. This announcement landed just as BNB traded at $857.52, posting a mild 0.57% gain in 24 hours but still down more than 25% over the past month, a pattern driven by the same macro pressures affecting Ethereum and the rest of the crypto market.

Title: Ethereum Steadies Near $2,900 as Fed Rate-Cut Odds Fuel $3,400 Rebound Hopes

Ethereum (ETH) is holding firm around the $2,900 level as improving macro sentiment, renewed whale accumulation, and rising ETF inflows strengthen expectations for a short-term rebound toward $3,400. Related Reading: Capriole Founder Not Bearish On Bitcoin Despite Headwinds—Here’s Why With Federal Reserve rate-cut odds now above 80%, traders are positioning for a potential shift in risk appetite that could benefit major cryptocurrencies, especially ETH. Ethereum has traded between $2,700 and $3,300 in recent weeks, but fresh catalysts are helping the asset stabilize above $2,900. The biggest driver is macroeconomic. CME FedWatch data shows the probability of a December interest-rate cut has surged from 30% to more than 80%. Lower interest rates typically encourage investment in risk-on assets such as crypto. Institutional flows reflect that shift. U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $96.67 million in inflows on November 24, with BlackRock alone contributing $92.6 million, its first inflow in two weeks Treasury giant BitMine continues to accumulate aggressively, adding 69,822 ETH (over $200 million) last week and bringing its total holdings to 3.63 million ETH, around 3% of the circulating supply. At the same time, whale wallets holding 10,000–100,000 ETH amassed 440,000 ETH in one week, signaling renewed confidence despite broader market caution. Despite trading under the 20-day SMA at $3,132, Ethereum is showing early signs of bullish momentum. The MACD histogram has crossed into positive territory, and the RSI is sitting near the neutral 50 line, with room to move higher before hitting overbought levels. Other indicators strengthen the bullish case: The first major test remains $3,132. A clean breakout and two consecutive daily closes above this level would likely trigger algorithmic buying and push ETH toward the $3,400 target within 5–7 days. Beyond that, resistance at $3,658 becomes the next upside objective. While bullish momentum is building, Ethereum still trades in a broad descending channel, and market structure remains fragile. Failure to reclaim $3,132 soon could send ETH back toward $2,750, with deeper support at $2,623 and the cycle low of $2,659. Related Reading: The Bull And Bear Scenario For XRP That Could Play Out In November Broader crypto weakness, negative spot flows, or delays in network upgrades could delay a breakout. However, with rising institutional demand, whale accumulation, and rate-cut optimism, Ethereum’s probability of retesting $3,400 is steadily improving. Confidence Level medium is at Medium (65%), as ETH’s path to $3,400 remains viable but requires confirmation through key resistance levels.

Title: Nasdaq ISE proposes to raise BlackRock IBIT options trading limits from 250,000 to 1 million

Share this article Nasdaq ISE, LLC (ISE) has proposed rule amendments to increase the position and exercise limits for options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) from 250,000 contracts to 1,000,000 contracts. The fund, managed by BlackRock, provides investors with exposure to Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts. IBIT was approved for options trading on the ISE last September. The exchange states that IBIT’s current 250,000-contract cap has become restrictive, given the rapid growth in options demand for IBIT during 2025. Increasing the limits would support greater hedging efficiency, facilitate income-generating option strategies, and allow market makers to provide deeper liquidity. The increased limits reflect surging institutional demand for Bitcoin ETF options as Wall Street expands its crypto trading operations. Nasdaq operates as a major stock exchange and has been adapting its infrastructure to accommodate growing institutional interest in crypto derivatives. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

During his thirty-eight year career he worked on six-continents in field and… More Info Vaalco Energy (NYSE:EGY) is small cap, Houston, Texas-based producer of oil and gas. Its original focus was offshore in the African country of Gabon, but a few years ago it diversified through a beneficial merger that expanded its global footprint. The company delivered a strong Q-4, 2023 earnings report that included news of its further diversification and entry into Côte d'Ivoire. The stock rallied to nearly $8.00 per share following the release of that report. A mixed report for Q-2 that year took the wind out of the company's sails, and thus began the long slide to the current $3.33 level. Now the Q-3 report is out, and there could be some reason for optimism for a rebound in the company’s shares, despite a miss on EPS and revenue. At a glance, the company trades at low multiples and is currently well below its 200 Day SMA of $3.90 per share. This bodes well for finding a favorable recommendation on EGY. In this article, we will dig into the particulars on EGY and come up with an investment recommendation for the stock. First we will take a quick look at the macro picture for oil. The crude oil macro The oversupply narrative is dominating trading in upstream equities. Crude oil has fallen about 30% thus far this year and may not have yet tested a bottom. Compounding current sluggishness is the war premium that had added back ~$10.00 to the price has leaked away as two of the three international hotbeds of belligerence-Israel/Gaza, and Ukraine/Russia, have shown signs of slowing to a simmer recently, a step down from outright hostilities. Peace, while a noble objective, is not good for business in oil and gas, as fears of a supply interruption keep traders long futures contracts in times of belligerence. When things calm down, the contracts are dumped on the market and must find a home, at a price. One spot worth keeping an eye on is Venezuela, as the U.S. turns the screws on the Maduro regime. A war in our hemisphere, so near the booming Guyanese ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Stabroeck project, could have profound consequences. Geopolitical volatility makes it important to pick your entry points carefully when investing in upstream oil and gas companies. There is good news on the horizon for those who take the plunge, however. Fortunately, demand remains strong and has decades to run if the new forecast from the International Energy Agency (IEA) is any guide. Fears of stranded barrels being written off on oil companies' balance sheets are less prevalent than a few years ago. The thesis for Vaalco Vaalco has been growing production since its merger with TransGlobe in 2022. This transformed the company from sole reliance on its Gabonese assets to a diversified player with a number of levers to pull globally. A move last year into Côte d'Ivoire was viewed favorably, and EGY just farmed into another offshore block in that country. In the short run, the company's focus has been on ramping up production in its Egyptian concession and Gabon. Results have been uneven with production progress and efficiency increases in Egypt, offset by a production turnaround and an FPSO refurbishment, combined with rig-related drilling delays in Gabon. This has pushed expected production from a new drilling campaign to the right, adversely impacting the stock. As the slide below notes, the shutdown and the near completion of the FPSO refurbishment, and then next the arrival of, Borr Drilling's Norve jack up is underway and should spud the first well sometime this month. Vaalco trades at a low EV/EBITDA multiple-2.8X, and a low flowing barrel valuation- $19K per barrel. Analysts here and on Wall Street rank the company as a strong buy. Price targets are $10.00 per share, but EPS estimates point to small losses over the next couple of quarters, which could delay any rally in the stock. The company has a quarter of its Q-4 production hedged at $ 60 and plans to increase this to about half. In 2026, EGY plans to hedge about 40% of its daily output. The company is returning capital to shareholders through a 6.5% dividend yield. The company has a small amount of LT debt and has been implementing a capital reduction and cost-cutting program that should improve cash flow and production. Catalysts for EGY An explorer's job is to find oil and gas. Full stop. Operating oil and gas assets is also enhanced by the adjacency of other assets. Sometimes this is called critical mass. It enables cost optimization through several avenues. Gaining operatorship over a block where seismic has already been shot for $3 million seems like a reasonably derisked proposition to me. Someone thought Block CI-705 offshore, Côte d'Ivoire, was prospective enough to shoot seismic, which isn't cheap, so it could be like the last person to pull the handle on a slot machine. Or it could lead to nothing. That's exploration. Dry holes are instructive as well. TotalEnergies, (NYSE: TTE) drilled a test in 2021, and DH'd it. Why did they drill it? Why does anyone think this area might be prospective? Well, if you go back 400 million years and put the puzzle pieces together to form Gondwana, you find the area now known as Côte d'Ivoire fits nicely adjacent to the areas known as Guyana and Suriname. That should cement it in your head as to what the Geo-types have in the back of their minds at EGY. This sort of thinking about the Atlantic Margin has led to the well-publicized discoveries in Guyana, Suriname, and Namibia. Snapshot of Atlantic basin (Google Maps) This is all down the road a piece, even in the success case. In the near term, we have the upcoming drilling campaigns in Gabon, Egypt, and the Baobab field in Côte d'Ivoire -EGY's legacy position from the TransGlobe merger. No catalyst discussion would be complete without at least a mention of EGY's 60% interest in Block P, offshore Equatorial Guinea. As of this date, a Plan of Development has been approved, and a Joint Operating Agreement is in place. Although Venus (Not to be confused with Total's Venus discovery offshore Namibia) As the slide below discusses, there is future prospectivity in this block. And the two producers and one injector needed to bring on Venus could be done in 2026. Canada is taking a backseat after several successes in the company's Cardium and Mannville plays in Alberta, with no further drilling planned until 2026. The slide below shows the 2.50-mile horizontal section performing nearly as well as the 3.0-mile type curve. Q-3, 2025 for EGY Most notably, the company hit the upper range of most production estimates, but cash flow suffered due to softness in Brent prices. Guidance for the full year expects 5% uplift YoY. Capex was reduced due to the issues with Gabon to optimize cash flow for the quarter. Even so, the company had to call upon its revolver for current expenses. Otherwise, the company has no debt. Company filings Risks to the thesis for EGY Even great deals can get cheaper. Picking an entry point can be frustrating as fundamentals continue to weaken. That's the era we are in right now. As I laid out in the Macro, there are many moving pieces driving oil prices, and most of them are not supportive. No matter how good the price of EGY stock looks relative to the recent past, it can always get cheaper when the market turns against upstream investors. Your takeaway EGY’s report reads pretty well. And EGY management is due some deference for their experience in West African operations, going back decades. Their balance sheet management also speaks well for the company. Borrowing money to support operations when interruptions in other projects present cash flow hiccups is no big deal. The company retains ample liquidity, assuming refurbishment with the FPSO goes according to plan. In my view, Vaalco's strong balance sheet, prospects for improving cash flow in the next year, and low multiples, put a buy target squarely on the company at its current level. The company is currently trading in a range well below its 50 and 200 day SMAs, which is probably more induced by the depressed pricing of Brent than anything else. I am giving EGY a Strong for investors with a high risk profile, seeking capital growth and competitive shareholder returns.

Title: Shoppers opt for basics over luxury goods this Black Friday over economic anxieties: report

Black Friday is going to the dogs. A growing number of shoppers are taking advantage of deep discounts this holiday season to scoop up everyday items like dog and cat food, detergent, socks and underwear — and not luxury items — as consumers fret about job security and the rising cost of living, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. More than six in 10 shoppers recently said they planned to buy the bare necessities instead of fancier items during sales, according to consultancy Deloitte. Last year, 58% of survey respondents said the same thing. Flagstaff, Ariz.-resident Eilise Fisher reportedly plans to stock up on 40-pound bags of Purina kibble for her rescue dogs. In years past, the government worker shopped for a new TV or a high-end Dutch oven, she told Bloomberg. “We’re seeing a strong early surge in sales this Black Friday and Cyber Monday season,” Dan Schaefer, CEO of dog supplement company Native Pet, told The Post. “Pet parents are stocking up on supplements.” Consumers like Fisher are jittery about their finances as a growing number of companies announce layoffs and inflation rages across the country, experts say. Shifts in President Trump’s tariff policy have added to the uncertainty, experts said. So, customers are using the Mecca of shopping days to restock on essentials or give practical presents like gift cards instead of splashing out. Those who plan to shop on Black Friday and Cyber Monday expect to spend an average of $622 – roughly 4% less than last year — according to a Deloitte survey of 1,200 US consumers. “The uncertainty around tariffs has gotten so out of hand that we can expect people to stock up on coffee and electronics in particular,” Wallet Hub analyst Chip Lupo told The Post. As a taste of things to come on Black Friday, Dawn Platinum Powerwash Dish Spray was highlighted as a bestseller during Amazon Prime’s sale this summer. “It’s hard to not feel like things are less affordable,” Megan Hamand, a San Diego, Calif.-based financial auditor, told Bloomberg. She said her husband is getting a decidedly boring but practical gift for the holidays: an external hard drive. For herself, she’s stocking up on basic beauty products she uses year-round like $40 Bobbi Brown mascara and $28 Coola sunscreen. High-income households account for a greater share of consumer spending than in years past. The richest 10% of Americans did nearly half of all such spending in the second quarter of the year, Bloomberg reported, citing a Moody’s Analytics analysis. “More consumers are showing budget consciousness and choosiness in how they spend, which means more necessities over discretionary [items],” KPMG economist Diane Swonk told the outlet.

Title: NYC Comptroller Calls for City Pensions to Drop BlackRock, Fidelity, PanAgora

Time Published: 2025-11-26T21:44:21Z

Brad Lander has recommended three of the city’s five pension funds rebid BlackRock’s U.S. public equities index mandates. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, the trustee and fiduciary for the city’s five pension funds, recommended that three of the funds drop BlackRock, Fidelity and PanAgora Asset Management because the asset managers have “inadequate decarbonization plans.” BlackRock, which manages $42.3 billion worth of index funds for the pension funds, as well as Fidelity and PanAgora, were found to have “failed to meet the systems’ climate expectations,” Lander said in a statement. Lander, who is leaving office on January 1 at the end of his term, said Wednesday he has updated the city’s Net Zero Implementation Plan for the New York City Employees’ Retirement System, the Teachers’ Retirement System of the City of New York and the New York City Board of Education Retirement System. In the update, Lander recommended that the three pension funds rebid BlackRock’s U.S. public equities index mandates and terminate those of active managers Fidelity and PanAgora. The comptroller made the recommendation after an evaluation of the pension funds’ 49 public-market managers. While 46 of the systems’ public-market managers submitted decarbonization plans that meet the requirements of the Net Zero Implementation Plans, the three asset managers failed to meet the pension funds’ climate expectations. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  The trustees of NYCERS, TRS and BERS adopted net zero implementation plans in 2023, in which they committed their funds to reach net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2040, according to Lander. This includes committing the funds to interim targets and to disclosing emissions; engaging asset managers and portfolio companies to adopt net-zero policies; investing in climate change solutions; and divesting to lower risk, according to information Lander released. According to the comptroller’s office, the pension funds collectively have reduced financed greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 2019, divested from fossil fuel reserve owners, and grew their climate-related investments to $11.9 billion, while registering a 10.5% return for fiscal 2025 that beat its actuarial target by 350 basis points. “The systemic risk of the climate crisis threatens the long-term value of New York City’s pension funds,” Lander said in a statement. “I am calling on my fellow trustees to move our money away from the three asset managers—BlackRock, Fidelity, and PanAgora—who fail to address climate risk with the seriousness we expect.” Lander said that after the administration of President Donald Trump changed the Securities and Exchange Commission’s requirements that public companies must disclose climate-related risks and greenhouse gas emissions, BlackRock ended engaging with U.S. companies on proxy voting issues in situations when the manager owns at least a 5% share. Because of the disengagement, Lander said BlackRock “does not sufficiently encourage portfolio companies to take concrete decarbonization actions.” Although BlackRock expanded access to its climate and decarbonization stewardship policy, it still fails to meet the pension funds’ expectations, according to Lander. The comptroller’s office also alleged that Fidelity has taken an “overly restrictive” interpretation of SEC guidance for companies in the U.S. and abroad to prevent influencing them about decarbonization, “even when such action is financially material.” Due to this, Lander is recommending that TRS terminate Fidelity’s world ex-U.S. small-cap mandate and reallocate its $384 million in assets away from firm. Additionally, Lander said investment firm PanAgora’s climate-related engagement only concerns disclosing emissions and “fails to encourage companies to take decarbonization actions,” such as setting emissions targets or adopting transition plans. As a result, Lander recommended that NYCERS and TRS drop PanAgora’s U.S. small-cap equity mandate. BlackRock, in a response to Lander posted on social media, stated that the firm had met earlier in November with the New York City Bureau of Asset Management, which houses the pension funds’ investment team, and updated BAM on the firm’s climate and decarbonization stewardship program. BlackRock’s response also accused the outgoing Lander of “politicization of public pension funds, which undermines the retirement security of hardworking New Yorkers.” BlackRock also noted that any changes to the pension funds’ investment mandates would require review by the funds’ boards, the BAM investment team and other stakeholders. “Should they take up your recommendation, we look forward to demonstrating the breadth and depth of our capabilities and the tremendous value we deliver,” wrote BlackRock’s Armando Senra, managing director and head of its Americas institutional business. Responses from Fidelity and PanAgora were not immediately available.

Title: Tokenized money market funds surge to $9B, BIS warns of new risks

Onchain money market funds have grown nearly 10-fold since 2023, but the Bank for International Settlements warns their adoption brings new liquidity and contagion risks. Tokenized money market funds are emerging as one of the most important yield-bearing assets on public blockchains, offering money-market returns and securities-level protections that stablecoins can’t provide, according to a new report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). According to the bulletin, tokenized money market funds now hold nearly $9 billion in assets, up from about $770 million at the end of 2023. The BIS warned that as these tokenized Treasury portfolios become a key source of collateral in the crypto ecosystem, they also bring new operational and liquidity risks. Tokenized money market funds are blockchain-based representations of traditional money market portfolios, providing investors with onchain access to short-term, interest-bearing assets, such as US Treasurys. The BIS noted that while these tokens offer the flexibility of stablecoins, they depend on permissioned wallets, offchain market plumbing and a small set of large holders; factors that could accelerate stress if redemptions spike or onchain liquidity thins out. Although the tokens move on public blockchains, the underlying portfolios, pricing and settlement still occur in traditional markets. BIS says that gap creates a structural mismatch: token transfers settle instantly, while the assets behind them do not. During periods of heavy withdrawals, this gap may make it more challenging for funds to meet redemptions without contributing to further volatility. Interlinkages with stablecoins create additional risk, as some tokenized money market funds also enable rapid conversions into stablecoins or are used for leveraged trades. The BIS warns that these feedback loops could allow market stress to spread much faster than in traditional money market funds. The analysis was released just a day after the institution appointed International Monetary Fund chief and CBDC backer Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli as the next head of its Innovation Hub. Related: Tokenized money market funds emerge as Wall Street’s answer to stablecoins The world’s top asset managers have been accelerating the expansion of tokenized money market funds across multiple blockchain networks. Franklin Templeton announced on Nov. 12 the integration of its Benji tokenization platform with the Canton Network, bringing tokenized assets — including its onchain US government money market fund — into a blockchain ecosystem designed for financial institutions. Asset manager BlackRock also recently announced the expansion of its tokenized money market fund, the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), to Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism and Polygon, broadening beyond Ethereum. RWA.xyz data shows that BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) currently dominates the onchain money market landscape, with more than $2.5 billion in tokenized assets. Franklin Templeton’s BENJI fund has over $844 million in tokenized US government securities, according to the data.

Title: ‘Low-hire, low-fire’ economy grinds on as lower-than-expected jobless claims suggests layoffs aren’t spiking

The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits declined last week in a sign that overall layoffs remain low, even as several high-profile companies have announced job cuts. U.S. applications for unemployment benefits in the week ending Nov. 22 dropped 6,000 from the previous week to 216,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. The figure is below the 230,000 forecast by economists, according to a survey by data provider FactSet. Applications for unemployment aid are seen as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. The job cuts announced recently by large companies such as UPS and Amazon typically take weeks or months to fully implement and may not yet be reflected in the claims data. The four-week average of claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, dropped 1,000 to 223,750. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state that has kept the unemployment rate historically low, but has left those out of work struggling to find a new job. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the week ending Nov. 15 rose 7,000 to 1.96 million, the government said. The increase is a sign that the unemployed are taking longer to find new work. Last week, the government said that hiring picked up a bit in September, when employers added 119,000 new jobs. Yet the report also showed employers had shed jobs in August. And the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%, its highest level in four years, as more Americans came off the sidelines to look for work but did not all immediately find jobs. On Tuesday, the government reported that retail sales slowed in September after three months of healthy increases. Consumer confidence plunged to its second-lowest level in five years, while wholesale inflation eased a bit. The data suggests that both the economy and inflation are slowing, which boosted financial markets’ expectations that the Federal Reserve will reduce its key interest rate at its next meeting Dec. 9-10.

As fears on Wall Street mount over the sustainability of the AI boom, Europe’s fintechs are showing their worth. Recently, WIRED author Brian Merchant spoke to University of Maryland economists Brent Goldfarb and David A. Kirsch, who devised their own scale for assessing whether certain innovations led to a market bubble. The economists analyzed 58 historical examples of tech bubbles and broke them down to their core components to create a scale from one to eight, where eight is the most likely to predict a bubble. Looking at factors like uncertainty, pure plays, novice investors, and narratives around commercial innovations, Goldfarb concluded that the AI bull run is a fully fledged eight. While this doesn’t confirm that we’re in a bubble, it shows that all the hallmarks are present. Billionaire Peter Thiel recently offloaded his entire stake in leading AI stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), according to 13F filings by Thiel Macro LLC. The total sell-off amounted to 537,742 shares in the chipmaker in Q3. Michael Burry, the investor who inspired The Big Short, also opened short positions against Nvidia and Palantir, betting that each stock is set to decline in value. The outlook for Wall Street AI firms is becoming increasingly clouded as concerns over a growing bubble mount. But in Europe, there’s a more optimistic tone surrounding the continent’s fintech sector. Could European fintech be an antidote to the artificial intelligence bubble? Let’s take a deeper look at a market that’s gathering momentum: European fintech is growing at a rapid pace. Forecasts suggest that the continent’s Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) market size is set to expand from a value of $2.46 billion in 2024 to $18.32 billion by 2033, representing a CAGR of 25.2%. This expected growth comes despite the recent news that leading UK-based fintechs Revolut and Wise are reportedly eyeing listings in the United States. “The jewel in the crown of European fintech is Adyen (AMS: ADYEN), which has a capitalization of €43.04 billion ($49.9bn) and provides flexible cross-border payment solutions for merchants at scale,” said Iván Marchena, Senior Economist at global brokerage brand Just2Trade. “Crucially, Adyen’s client list spans a wide range of sectors and features names like Uber, Netflix, and Spotify. At a time when there are tangible concerns over the self-funding cycle of AI giants on Wall Street, we’re seeing more fintechs build a sustainable client pool that could help to ensure their longevity.” Platforms like Klarna, which serve more than 100 million customers in 17 countries, are an example of the immediate success that many European fintechs have found in immediately accessing major international markets with their services. There are signs that Europe’s fintech ecosystem is gathering momentum. Flatpay, which facilitates card payments for SMBs, recently reached a value of $1 billion. The startup has already sought to take on its larger rivals by introducing a flat transaction rate for merchants to use its card terminals and point-of-sale systems. Impressively, the Danish startup has claimed that it has grown from 7,000 customers in April 2024 to 60,000 today. Flatpay’s own valuation has also grown exponentially and is now valued at €1.5 billion ($1.75bn). Given its high growth rate, CEO and co-founder Sander Janca-Jensen is now targeting annual recurring revenue (ARR) to solidify Flatpay’s emergence into a profitable European fintech platform. Europe is also becoming a key location for blockchain innovations in the fintech landscape. MQube, a platform that tokenizes mortgage debt by converting financial assets into digital tokens and recording them on a shared ledger, has now tokenized £1.3 billion ($1.7bn), underlining its position as a driving force for securing mortgages using blockchain technology. As blockchain and digital currency technology become increasingly intertwined with fintech, Europe has an opportunity to use its leading position in the ecosystem to introduce cutting-edge financial tools and services to drive further growth throughout the ecosystem. This helps to ensure a pipeline for innovation, even as leading domestic players like Revolut and Wise remain attracted to the prospect of US listings. At a time when suspicions over the longevity of the AI boom are continually coming into question, Europe’s melting pot of innovative fintechs can be a major draw for investors who are seeking exposure to stocks with higher growth potential as AI investments receive mixed levels of sentiment. Given that fintech solutions are finding adoption in a more frictionless manner, it’s reasonable to expect European firms to achieve sustainable growth that can help them find profitability and scalability in the future. Whether the artificial intelligence boom is in a bubble or not, Wall Street investors can find plenty of opportunities throughout Europe’s melting pot of fintech innovators, and these tech firms could offer some resilience in the face of uncertainty in AI.

Airship AI’s (NASDAQ: AISP) Q4 stock price correction is not without cause, but it is overdone, setting up a buying opportunity for investors. The quality of the opportunity is highlighted by the insider activity, which was bullish in November. Two insiders, including director and CEO Victor Huang, bought shares late in the month, shortly after its Q3 earnings report triggered a sudden downdraft. The earnings report is a concern for this emerging tech stock. However, the miss is due to one-offs, including the impact of Trump’s administration change, downsizing government staff, and the government shutdown. The takeaway is that the shutdown compounded slowdowns in the approval and payment process, impacting AISP's business. The details that matter include the backlog, pipeline, and expected spending increases tied to the Big Beautiful Bill. It contains billions in funding for border security and other security and defense needs that Airship AI is positioned to meet. Insider purchases are significant because these executives did not need to buy shares to indicate their support. CEO Victor Huang is reported to own as much as 12% of the stock through personal and various family holdings, while total insider exposure ranges from 30% to 40%. The company has a $166 million pipeline connected to a single government client, expected to close in 18-24 months. This is projected to enable over 1000% revenue growth compared to the 2025 forecast. The sell-side activity, including short selling, analysts, and institutions, has this market set up for volatility. The analysts’ coverage is virtually nil, indicating no support from that vector: coverage by a half dozen analysts lapsed over the last year, and the most recent update isn’t good. Weiss Ratings pegged the stock as a Sell, although it did not provide a price target; this rating was still sufficient to exacerbate the Q4 downdraft, given the high short interest. Short interest is running near 20% as of mid-November and is likely to remain high until a potent catalyst emerges. When it does, it could trigger a short-squeeze. The good news is that institutions are buying. The ownership is still light at roughly 6% but it is rising, and buying activity is robust. The pace in 2025 is about $3 bought for each $1 sold and will likely remain favorable for the foreseeable future. Buyers include a wide range of institutions, including mutual fund and ETF managers such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and Russell Investments Group. Airship AI is included in several Russell indices, including the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000. While dilution played a role in AISP’s stock price headwind, the threat is diminished in December. The exercise of warrants after the quarter’s end raised approximately $9 million in capital, positioning the company well for the upcoming year. The resulting $15.5 million in cash on the balance sheet is sufficient for several years of operation at the Q3 cash burn rate, ample time to get it over the line to profitability. The bad news is that AISP’s share price is rangebound. That said, the Q4 sell-off put the market at the range bottom, and a rebound is already building. The insider buys triggered a positive market response, driving the price up by more than 15% the following week. Assuming the market picks up on the signal, AISP could continue rising in December. The risk is that short-sellers will continue to sell into the rallies, capping gains Thomas Hughes has been a contributing writer for InsiderTrades.com since 2019.

The production of green hydrogen, a technology based on the transformation of this element through electrolysis, is one of the keys. The IEA estimates that it would make it possible to save the 830 million tonnes of CO2 per year that originate when this gas is produced using fossil fuels. Our way of life needs an increasing amount of watts to function. The war in Ukraine has caused a global energy crisis due to the lack of fossil fuels. This has led to an unprecedented rise in the price of natural gas and coal, causing Europe to import much more liquefied natural gas than usual, with the attendant problem of worsening climate change. However, decarbonising the planet suggests a different world in 2050: one that is more accessible, efficient and sustainable, and driven by clean energies such as green hydrogen. Advantages And Disadvantages Of Green Hydrogen Market This energy source has pros and cons that we must be aware of. Let's go over some of its most important good points: However, green hydrogen also has negative aspects that should be borne in mind: Impact of green hydrogen Hydrogen as a fuel is a reality in countries like the United States, Russia, China, France and Germany. Others like Japan are going even further and aspire to become a hydrogen economy. Below we explain what the impact will be in the future: Electricity and drinking water generator : These two elements are obtained by reacting hydrogen and oxygen together in a fuel cell. This process has proved very useful on space missions, for example, by providing crews with water and electricity in a sustainable manner. Energy storage : Compressed hydrogen tanks are capable of storing energy for long periods of time and are also easier to handle than lithium-ion batteries because they are lighter. Transport and mobility : Hydrogen's great versatility allows it to be used in those consumption niches that are very difficult to decarbonise, such as heavy transport, aviation and maritime transport. There are already several projects under way in this area, such as Hycarus and Cryoplane, which are promoted by the European Union (EU) and aim to introduce it in passenger aircraft.

In 2025, the alkaline electrolyzer segment led the market because it offered the most cost-effective and technologically mature solution for large-scale hydrogen production. Its longer operational lifespan and ability to run continuously made it highly attractive for industrial users and utility-scale projects. Manufacturers also benefited from well-established supply chains, which kept production costs lower compared to newer technologies like PEM electrolyzers. In 2025, expanding renewable energy installations created strong demand for el The polymer electrolyte membrane (pem) electrolyzer is expected to grow fastest in the forecast period because of its superior ability to operate efficiently with variable renewable energy sources like solar and wind. Its fast response time and high hydrogen purity made it especially valuable for mobility, aerospace, and high-grade industrial applications. Advances in materials science and manufacturing lowered production costs, helping PEM systems scale more competitively. Application Insights What Made the Transport Segment Lead the Green Hydrogen Market in 2025? The transport segment led the market in 2025 primarily due to its ability to decarbonize sectors where batteries face limitations, such as heavy-duty trucks, buses, shipping, and aviation. Governments accelerated hydrogen mobility through subsidies, fuel-cell vehicle incentives, and national hydrogen corridor projects, boosting large-scale adoption. Fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) offered longer driving ranges and faster refueling times, making them more suitable for commercial fleets. Rapid expansion of hydrogen refueling infrastructure, supported by public-private partnerships, further strengthened market leadership. The power generation is the second-largest segment, leading the market mainly because utilities increasingly turned to hydrogen as a long-term solution for clean, dispatchable energy. Growing concerns over grid stability and renewable intermittency pushed investment towards hydrogen-based power plants capable of storing excess solar and wind energy. Governments and energy regulators supported these projects through incentives for hydrogen-ready turbines and long-duration energy storage technologies. Distribution Channel Insights How Pipeline Segment Leads the Green Hydrogen Market? In 2025, the pipeline segment led the market because it offered the most efficient and cost-effective method for transporting hydrogen over long distances. Growing investments in repurposing existing natural gas pipelines enabled faster deployment and lower infrastructure costs compared to building new transport systems. Pipelines also supported large industrial clusters and hydrogen hubs that required constant, high-volume supply. Governments and energy agencies promoted pipeline networks to strengthen regional hydrogen economies and improve cross-border energy trade. The cargo segment is expected to grow fastest over the forecast period because hydrogen-powered fuel-cell systems proved especially suitable for heavy-duty freight operations that require long range and fast refueling. Logistics companies increasingly adopted hydrogen solutions to strict meter emissions regulations and sustainability mandates for fleet decarbonization. Hydrogen offers a clear advantage over batteries for long-haul cargo movement by minimizing downtime and supporting higher payload capacities. Source Insights The solar renewable energy sector dominates the green hydrogen space because it is an abundant resource in many parts of the world and is very beneficial when there is an abundance of sunlight. Countries such as India, Australia, and a few regions of Africa have established solar PV and solar thermal energy that can be used to run the electrolyzers that make hydrogen. Since hydrogen is converted from solar energy, solar also represents continuous and intermittent renewable power throughout the day hours which is an excellent way to reduce carbon emissions and associated costs. The large-scale projects being deployed in deserts around the world, components for hydrogen, also make intensive hydrogen solar power projects far more attractive in terms of the project. Global Green Hydrogen Market, By Source, 2022-2024 (USD Million) Wind energy plays a prominent role and is the fastest growing segment in the green hydrogen market due to the alignment of producing wind resources in windy places such as Europe and the coastal regions of water bodies. The wind turbines are also always working night and day, unlike solar. This represents a more stable hydrogen electrolyzer production. The Germany and UK governments have also advocated for wind-to-hydrogen projects to help reduce burdensome emissions developed from heavy industries. End User Insights The refining segment dominated the green hydrogen market with a revenue share of 41.85% in 2025. This is primarily because it is the world's largest consumer of hydrogen, using millions of tons annually for essential processes such as hydrocracking and hydrotreating to produce cleaner fuels. This massive, established demand provides an immediate, ready-made market for green hydrogen that other industrial or mobility applications currently lack. The existing infrastructure for hydrogen storage and pipelines makes integrating new, green hydrogen production facilities a more direct and feasible technical challenge than building new end-user supply chains from scratch, thereby solidifying its initial market dominance.

Title: Turkey Still Frozen? How AI Can Rescue Thanksgiving Disasters
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronschmelzer/2025/11/26/turkey-still-frozen-how-ai-can-rescue-thanksgiving-disasters/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:47:29Z
Full Content:
ByRon Schmelzer, Contributor. Generative AI is quietly becoming a first responder for holiday chaos. Every year someone forgets to thaw the turkey. Or realizes they’re missing nutmeg. Or discovers the mashed potatoes have turned gummy 10 minutes before guests arrive. Thanksgiving disasters are a tradition as ingrained as the cranberry sauce. The difference in 2025 is that many households are turning to AI as an emergency hotline for everything from last-minute menu pivots to oven triage. A 2025 YouGov survey summarized by Brookings reports that 56% of U.S. adults have used AI tools and 28% use them weekly for day-to-day tasks. Consumer studies show that 61% of adults have used AI in the past six months, with nearly 1 in 5 relying on it daily. Families have started using these tools for the same everyday tasks that once fell to harried hosts, including cooking, grocery lists and budgeting. Food preparation is one of the fastest-growing use cases. Research on “AI in the kitchen” suggests about 64% of consumers have already tapped AI for recipe ideas, meal planning or kitchen troubleshooting, according to a study by AskAttest. Rising costs are accelerating the trend. The American Farm Bureau estimates that the average Thanksgiving dinner for 10 now sits around $55.18, down slightly from last year but still well above pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows year-over-year food-at-home prices up 2.7%, with meat and poultry costs rising even faster. Putting a holiday meal on the table now requires more planning, more math and more strategy. Overlay that with the chaos of hosting relatives, and the usual scatter-brained nature of planning complex multistep tasks in a compressed time environment, and it is no surprise that generative AI is emerging as a real-time rescue tool. Thanksgiving is more project management than cooking. It requires sequencing dozens of steps under time pressure while navigating unexpected problems. In past years, hosts turned to search engines, frantic group texts or a parent who “always knows what to do.” Search volume spikes each November for terms like “turkey won’t thaw,” “oven schedule Thanksgiving” and “how to fix lumpy gravy.” Today people are leaning on AI for rapid, contextualized judgment calls. AI tools are becoming the triage nurse for exactly these moments, stitching together advice, timelines, substitutions and rescue strategies in seconds. When using AI for Thanksgiving troubleshooting or disaster prevention, context matters even more than during calm planning. Start with a detailed briefing. A well-structured prompt can turn a looming disaster into a manageable adjustment. Here is a flexible prompt template you can use for this purpose: “You are my Thanksgiving kitchen triage assistant. Context: - Number of adults: - Number of kids: - Dietary needs or allergies: - Cooking skill level: - Available equipment (one oven, air fryer, Instant Pot, etc.): Current disaster or problem: [Describe the issue: turkey still frozen, missing an ingredient, side dish failed, running late] Constraints: - Time until guests arrive: - Budget flexibility: - Ingredients on hand: Goal: - Rescue plan with clear steps, backups and timing adjustments.” This level of detail lets AI deliver not just general advice but a survival plan tailored to your challenging kitchen needs. Even under normal conditions, AI can help you plan a menu with built-in safety nets. The trick is to design dishes that minimize points of failure. You can use AI to plan a menu based on risk tolerance. Tell AI if you have a tiny oven, no mixer or only one large pot. It will reshape the menu to avoid collisions that become disasters at 2 p.m. on Thursday. Likewise, if your table includes vegans, gluten-free diners and traditionalists, AI can help consolidate overlapping dishes so you avoid cooking three versions of everything. This reduces the odds of errors like cross-contamination or forgetting an essential side. For example: “Create a Thanksgiving menu for 10 that is low-risk and disaster-resistant. Requirements: - Only one oven. - Limited fridge space. - Beginner skill level. - Dishes should tolerate being made ahead, reheated or held warm.” AI will propose ideas with fewer temperature-sensitive steps, simpler techniques and more flexible ordering. A surprising number of Thanksgiving problems start at the store. Missing ingredients cause last-minute panic. Buying too much creates storage issues. Buying the wrong brand leads to consistency problems. And sometimes your most important ingredient is out of stock or unavailable. AI can step in here to help: “Turn these recipes into a consolidated shopping list. Group by store aisle. Flag ingredients that are easy to forget. Flag high-cost items where substitutions are possible. Identify items I should buy in duplicate to avoid emergencies. Help identify useful crisis prevention features such as: Highlight items prone to stockouts near the holiday and provide alternatives if they are not available Identify ingredients with large price swings Suggest pantry backups (like evaporated milk or broth) Build a 'Thanksgiving emergency kit’ of spices, foil, butter and broth” You can also ask AI to generate a cross-store comparison table so you can plug in prices from Aldi, Walmart, Costco or your local market. The LLMs themselves won’t have access to the most recent prices, however, so this will be a more challenging task. In the near future, expect the AI systems to have live connectors with current pricing so this should be a more trivial ask. The biggest disasters happen in the final three hours before the meal. AI thrives here. Make it your kitchen strategist, using this following prompt to help you get your act together: “You are my Thanksgiving day kitchen scheduler. Menu: [paste recipes] Dinner time: 5 p.m. Constraints: one oven, four burners, an air fryer. Tasks: 1) Build a timeline from 24 hrs before dinner to serving time. 2) Identify critical path steps. 3) Show when oven conflicts will occur and offer alternatives. 4) Suggest prep tasks that reduce chaos. Help me avoid the ‘everything needs 375 degrees F at once’ problem: Given these dishes and their preferred temperatures, create a single-oven plan that avoids temperature changes. Allow minor temperature compromises and note how they affect results.” If something goes wrong, AI can rescue you on the fly. Here are some AI quick-save prompt possibilities based on the disaster. Turkey still frozen at 10 a.m. (You know it needs to be thawed out well in advance, right?): “Act as a highly experienced home cook chef. Please help me with a critical problem I am facing.The turkey is still partially frozen. Dinner is in 6 hours. The turkey weighs 14 pounds. Give me safe, USDA-aligned rapid-thaw options and an adjusted cooking timeline.” Mashed potatoes too gluey? Try the following: “Help! You are my thanksgiving day triage assistant. My mashed potatoes turned gummy. Guests arrive in 30 minutes. Give me a fix using common ingredients.” Stuffing dried out? Try the following prompt: “Acting as a very experienced home cook chef capable of recovering any home cooking problem using commonly available ingredients and supplies.My stuffing is dry and crumbly. How can I rescue it without making it mushy?” AI cannot taste your food, but it can apply known kitchen chemistry and common approaches to rescue most dishes. Thanksgiving overspending is its own form of disaster. The PwC 2025 Holiday Outlook survey reports that about 84% of consumers expect to cut back spending over the next six months because of higher prices and a tougher economic outlook. The same PwC survey notes that 53% of consumers say price increases will likely affect their holiday spending decisions. AI supports budget recovery in several ways. First it can diagnose your menu’s cost centers by analyzing menus and ranking dishes by cost. AI can help suggest ways to reduce total cost by 20% without losing the holiday feel. It can also suggest alternatives for expensive items while maintaining flavor profiles. You still need to sanity-check allergy considerations, but it is a strong starting point. You can also use AI to build a budget strategy after something goes wrong. For example, if a dish burns or ingredients spoil, AI can propose fallback options that stay within your remaining budget. Post-Thanksgiving regret also often stems from having either way too many leftovers or not enough to make the weekend easy. AI can help build a leftovers plan that avoids both. For example, after providing some detail of your menu to an AI system, try the following prompt to help adjust cooking quantities: “Help me plan quantities for seven adults and three kids. We want leftovers for one additional meal only. Give recommended amounts for turkey, sides, and desserts.” Or you can use AI to creatively repurpose your cooking output. AI can reassign ingredients or repurpose partially saved dishes. “I burned half the stuffing. Here is what is left. Create a next-day meal plan using what survived.” Extra points if you provide a photo of the burned side and if AI can generate an image of what the rescued meal would look like. As we become more comfortable and familiar with AI, we all know that we can’t always trust AI outputs. AI can calm panic, but it also makes confident mistakes. Treat it like a smart assistant, not an authority. Always verify cooking temperatures. Use USDA guidelines to confirm poultry temps and resting times. Make sure to check allergy-related substitutions. AI can miss hidden allergens. Double-check any substitution involving nuts, dairy, gluten or soy. Be cautious with timing shortcuts. If a suggestion seems too good to be true, it probably is. Do not rely on AI to reduce safe cooking or cooling times. Just because the LLM confidently says something can be done on a specific time frame doesn’t mean it actually can. This is especially important for thawing, reheating and cooling food. When in doubt, consult USDA, FDA or your local extension office. AI has transitioned from a novelty to a true kitchen command center. It helps troubleshoot thawing issues, prevent oven collisions, salvage failed sides and can keep costs under control. Used well, it reduces stress and increases safety without replacing the heart of the holiday. So even if the turkey is still frozen on Thursday morning, the holiday can be saved, gracefully, safely and with your sanity intact.

Title: Central banks warn DeFi and $9bn tokenised money-market funds jeopardise global finance

Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:39:26Z

About us Copy link Tokenised money-market funds have ballooned to a $9 billion crypto market sector, but what looks like quiet progress has got the Bank for International Settlements sounding early risk warnings. Analysts at the Basel-based global forum of central banks and the Collegio Carlo Alberto, a research institute, said that, despite their digital packaging, these crypto funds remain exposed to traditional money-market tensions, according to a report published on Wednesday. Tokenised money-market funds are just like their traditional counterparts: they allow investors to earn yield on cash instruments directly on-chain. “Tokenised money-market funds give rise to risks that mirror and may even amplify those found in conventional money market funds and stablecoins,” the report stated. The analysts said decentralised finance integration may heighten market stresses through leverage and interconnected protocols, or what industry proponents call composability. Given the tight coupling between such funds and stablecoins, market shocks could spread more quickly and cause greater damage than in traditional markets. The warning comes as tokenised money-market funds surge alongside crypto’s broader expansion into real-world assets, a trend that even the BIS sees as a gateway for institutional capital to flow into the digital asset market. Tokenised money-market funds grew 265% in the last year, according to data from RWA.xyz. And the sector could grow to $250 billion in the next three years, Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, predicted in October. Even as it sounded the alarm, the BIS said these crypto products may become a backbone of the global financial system, given their growth and rising institutional interest. Traditional finance juggernauts like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Swiss Bank UBS are some of the institutional players in the tokenised money market sector. But with this growth potential comes the need for proactive measures to curtail market risks before they harden into systemic threats that could upend both the crypto and traditional markets, the report stated.

Employees were told they’ll be paid through the end of their contracts — or November 30 at the latest — but their system access was cut immediately, Business Insider reports. Has reportedly laid off about 200 workers, or 1.5% of its staff, as the company braces for the end of federal EV tax credits under President Trump’s policy changes. The $7,500 incentive for new electric cars expires this month, adding to pressure from cooling demand. Despite the cuts, Rivian says it’s moving ahead with plans for a lower-cost model. Is cutting another 101 jobs in Seattle and 254 in San Francisco, just weeks after a wave of layoffs in August. The company, which had about 3,900 local employees before the cuts, hasn’t explained the move and declined to comment. Is trimming another 262 jobs at its San Francisco headquarters, according to a state filing, with layoffs set to take effect November 3.

The Israeli-founded unicorn is partnering with Attentive and Omnisend to continue supporting marketing services while investing in AI-powered tools like automated review summaries, smart sorting, and a new Loyalty Tiers system. Laid off 30 employees and is now offering buyouts to the remaining 200. The AI coding startup recently acquired by Cognition has had a rocky stretch, including a near-acquisition by OpenAI and a reverse-acqui-hire by Google that saw key talent depart before Cognition stepped in. Despite initial promises to value Windsurf’s team, the deal now looks more focused on the startup’s intellectual property than its people. Is cutting 100 jobs, and its CEO, Jen Sargent, is departing. Amazon is reorganizing its audio operations, moving Wondery’s audio-only podcasts under Audible and placing video-focused shows into a new Creator Services division. Amazon acquired Wondery in 2020. Has cut 150 roles in customer service and support, following enhancements to its platform and tools that have significantly reduced support needs. The decision came via a prerecorded message from CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes, just hours before co-founder Scott Farquhar urged Australia to embrace an “AI revolution” and move beyond “jobs of the past” in an Australian Press Club address. The Australian software firm was founded 2002. Is cutting about 7% of its workforce, or 47 employees, as part of a push toward profitability, Bloomberg reports. The decision follows the recent acquisition of a startup with around 30 staff, who will stay on with the company. Despite the cuts, the blockchain software company that operates the popular digital wallet MetaMask says it will continue hiring for select roles.

Title: Grayscale files with SEC to list Zcash ETF
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-sec-zcash-etf
Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:25:44Z
Full Content:
The fund, which could be listed on NYSE Arca, would be the first ETF tied to a privacy coin, following several other listings from Grayscale and asset managers. Grayscale is aiming to convert its Zcash Trust into a spot exchange-traded fund in a move that could mark one of the first investment vehicles linked to a privacy coin. In a Wednesday filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Grayscale submitted a Form S-3 registration statement, signaling its intention to convert its fund tied to Zcash (ZEC) into a spot ETF. The move followed Grayscale’s launch of other spot ETFs linked to cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP (XRP). The simplified form with the regulator could allow Grayscale to list the Zcash ETF on the NYSE Arca. According to data from Nansen, the price of ZEC increased by more than 50% in the past 30 days and by 1,050% in the past 12 months, reaching $519.62 at the time of publication. Since the SEC initially approved the listing and trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, several asset management companies, including Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, and others, have expanded their offerings to include exposure to other cryptocurrencies. Grayscale debuted the first spot DOGE ETF this week, which saw $1.4 million in volume on Monday. Related: NYSE approves Grayscale DOGE and XRP ETFs, clearing launch for Monday Earlier this month, Leap Therapeutics said it would use a $50 million investment from Winklevoss Capital, the venture capital firm founded by Gemini creators Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, to acquire ZEC tokens as part of its cryptocurrency treasury strategy. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas later argued on social media that the privacy coin could essentially pull support away from Bitcoin, though many users were skeptical of his claims.

Title: These Fortune 500 companies are laying off thousands of workers and fueling economic anxiety
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/26/layoffs-economy-how-many-what-companies-fortune-500/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:17:13Z
Full Content:
It’s a tough time to be looking for a job. Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, sizable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from U.S. President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands. And the record 43-day government shutdown also left many without paychecks. The impasse put key economic data on hold, too. In a delayed report released last week, the Labor Department said U.S. employers added a surprising 119,000 jobs in September. But unemployment rose to 4.4% — and other troubling details emerged, including revisions showing the economy actually lost 4,000 jobs in August. The shutdown also resulted in holes for more recent hiring numbers. The government says it won’t release a full jobs report for October. Here are some of the largest job cuts announced recently: In November, HP said this week it expected to lay off between 4,000 and 6,000 employees. The cuts are part of a wider initiative from the computer maker to streamline operations, which includes adopting AI to increase productivity. The company aims to complete these actions by the end of the 2028 fiscal year. Also in November, Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees. In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and “reorient” the entire company. General Motors will lay off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio in late October, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles. Hundreds of additional employees are reportedly slated for “temporary layoffs” at the start of next year. In long-awaited cuts just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount plans to lay off about 2,000 employees — about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs in late October, according to a source familiar with the matter. In November, Paramount also announced plans to eliminate 1,600 positions as part of divestitures of Televisión Federal in Argentina and Chilevision in Chile. And the company said another 600 employees had chosen voluntary severance packages as part of a coming push to return to the office full-time. Amazon said in October that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. United Parcel Service has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs. UPS also closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year. Target in October said it would eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions, or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. The retailer said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts. In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence, digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. Oil giant ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. Between 2,600 and 3,250 workers were expected to be impacted, with most layoffs set to take place before the end of 2025. Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business. In July, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 “core” workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction. In May, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The company has cited “organizational changes,” but the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures.

I'd definitely recommend Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) or Oakley Meta Vanguard, but if you're new to smart glasses, start on the first-gen ground floor. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta wants to clear out stock of its first-generation Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. It's launched Black Friday deals for its old Wayfarer models, with its G15 Green and Clear Wayfarers at $238 ($60 off) and its more popular Matte Black Wayfarers with Polarized Graphite lenses at $263 ($66 off). Meta glasses have never gotten a major sale in the 2+ years since launch, making this a rare opportunity. In some ways, this deal is a trap. Meta just launched its Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses and Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses, both of which I gave glowing reviews. I particularly loved how Meta improved battery life this generation, while the first-gen models have shorter battery life by comparison. Here's the problem: the new Ray-Bans start at $379, or $409 with polarized lenses, while Vanguard launched at $499, and I don't expect either device to get a major discount until 2027, based on past history. If you're shopping for your first smart glasses, it makes much more sense to buy the first-gen glasses for less and see if you like them or not; they'll last you until Meta's third-generation glasses in a couple of years. or: Wayfarer (Gen 1) Polarized Graphite: $329 $263.20 at Best Buy Android Central verdict: ★★★★ The original Ray-Ban Meta glasses blew up in a way no one expected, selling millions of units on the strength of its high-res photography, open-ear audio, and Meta AI insights. You get a natural fit that blends in with other sunglasses, letting you capture shots organically by tapping a button or ask the AI for insights, all with your phone in your pocket. Also at: Amazon | Meta If you compare the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 vs. Gen 1, the difference isn't as stark as you'd assume. The photo resolution and FoV, storage space, IPX4 water resistance, mic and speaker quality, Wi-Fi/ Bluetooth connectivity, and apps are unchanged, while the weight is virtually the same. The new glasses do give you a video resolution boost from 1080p to 3K and a couple of extra hours of battery life. But is it worth spending an extra $150 or so for the 2nd-gen polarized glasses, just to get these two perks? Equally important, Meta has already brought its best second-generation features to its first-gen glasses, making them feel new. Vanguard glasses introduced Garmin integration in October, autocapturing videos at important race moments and reading out your health stats from your wrist; Meta brought this feature to Gen 1 glasses the next month. Likewise, Vanguard glasses added improved video stabilization algorithms to make in-motion sporty videos look smoother, and Meta brought the feature to first-gen glasses in November without telling anyone. Meta isn't interested in gatekeeping its features to make you upgrade, which means you can buy the last-gen Ray-Ban deal without any FOMO. The shorter battery life, you'll have to live with. But smart glasses fans lived with the 4-hour maximum for two years; you can too to get this Black Friday price! Or, if you can't, splurge on the full-price newer glasses without regrets!

Title: Coffee Break: Nvidia’s Narrative Breaking Down?

Nvidia’s narrative took a major hit this week due to multiple factors including the emergence of a credible rival, OpenAI’s struggles, and a trade war pincer that has them caught between Trump and China. Is a Government Backstop the Bull Case? Nvidia’s narrative, which it kicked off with the launch of Ampere architecture and A100 chip in 2020, subsumed any competing story-lines in the post-pandemic American stock markets in 2022, and engulfed the entire American economy under Trump. Nvidia’s narrative that Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini ARE the future of technology and the global economy has made them the world’s largest corporation by market cap. The Trump administration may be all-in with Nvidia’s narrative and may be signaling its willingness to backstop the industry to prevent the AI bubble popping. Paypal mafioso and Trump tech czar David Sacks had previously indicated the government would not be backstopping OpenAI earlier this month. I argued elsewhere that Sacks’ tweet contributed to the downturn in AI stocks we saw in the first weeks of this month. But on the 24th, Sacks seemed to signal a change in his (very influential) thinking, in response to a Wall Street Journal piece headlined, “How the U.S. Economy Became Hooked on AI Spending and subtitled, “Growth has been bolstered by data-center investment and stock-market wealth. A reversal could raise the risk of recession.” According to today’s WSJ, AI-related investment accounts for half of GDP growth. A reversal would risk recession. We can’t afford to go backwards. — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 24, 2025 Paired with the White House’s executive order titled “Launching the Genesis Mission” released the same day, many took this as bullish news for Nvidia’s narrative and the larger AI bubble. The closest thing I could find to an action word in the EO was this promise to: …build an integrated AI platform to harness Federal scientific datasets — the world’s largest collection of such datasets, developed over decades of Federal investments — to train scientific foundation models and create AI agents to test new hypotheses, automate research workflows, and accelerate scientific breakthroughs. Critics of the Nvidia narrative will of course point out that when a government backstop is the bull case, the bubble is in trouble. Maybe that’s why the a handful of naysayers who’ve been fighting the tide, are now being joined by some major investors who are putting their money where the critics’ keyboards have been. Team Bear Beefs Up Pioneering Nvidia bears like AI scientist Gary Marcus and journalist Ed Zitron have now been joined by notable investors including the “Big Short” contrarian Michael Burry and billionaire Stanley “I killed the Pound” Druckenmiller who sold all 214,060 of his funds’ Nvidia shares. Marcus and Zitron remain opinion leaders in the space, however. Marcus is currently dealing with the emergence of a class of rival AI experts who’ve been on the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) bandwagon and are now getting off. AGI is the patent nonsense that LLMs are just a few months away from creating super-intelligent, self-replicating machines. Naturally, belief in AGI has been the conventional wisdom in Silicon Vally for the last couple of years and continues to be a big part of the bulls’ case for the Nvidia narrative. Marcus has taken lots of heat for calling bullshit on LLMs as the road to AGI from the get go, and is now expressing mixed feelings about the big names who are joining him on the critical side. Those names include Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun and OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever. As for Ed Zitron, his latest “The Hater’s Guide To NVIDIA” is well worth the subscription price and the estimated 54 minute reading time. It includes an excellent, concise explanation of why Nvidia has become the hero of the Nvidia narrative which has reshaped the U.S. economy: Back in 2006, NVIDIA launched CUDA, a software layer that lets you run (some) software on (specifically) NVIDIA graphics cards, and over time this has grown into a massive advantage for the company. The thing is, GPUs are great for parallel processing – essentially spreading a task across multiple, by which I mean thousands, of processor cores at the same time – which means that certain tasks run faster than they would on, say, a CPU. While not every task benefits from parallel processing, or from having several thousand cores available at the same time, the kind of math that underpins LLMs is one such example. CUDA is proprietary to NVIDIA, and while there are alternatives (both closed- and open-source), none of them have the same maturity and breadth. Pair that with the fact that Nvidia’s been focused on the data center market for longer than, say, AMD, and it’s easy to understand why it makes so much money. There really isn’t anyone who can do the same thing as NVIDIA, both in terms of software and hardware, and certainly not at the scale necessary to feed the hungry tech firms that demand these GPUs. Anyway, back in 2019 NVIDIA acquired a company called Mellanox for $6.9 billion, beating off other would-be suitors, including Microsoft and Intel. Mellanox was a manufacturer of high-performance networking gear, and this acquisition would give NVIDIA a stronger value proposition for data center customers. It wanted to sell GPUs — lots of them — to data center customers, and now it could also sell the high-speed networking technology required to make them work in tandem. This is relevant because it created the terms under which NVIDIA could start selling billions (and eventually tens of billions) of specialized GPUs for AI workloads. … Because nobody else has really caught up with CUDA, NVIDIA has a functional monopoly… NVIDIA has been printing money, quarter after quarter, going from a meager $7.192 billion in total revenue in the third (calendar year) quarter of 2023 to an astonishing $50 billion in just data center revenue (that’s where the GPUs are) in its most recent quarter, for a total of $57 billion in revenue, and the company projects to make $63 billion to $67 billion in the next quarter. But never fear, Ziton also puts a stake through the heart of the Nvidia narrative over the course of several thousand words. Here’s a key point: NVIDIA makes so much money, and it makes it from a much smaller customer base than most companies, because there are only so many entities that can buy thousands of chips that cost $50,000 or more each. Zitron cites pseudonymous finance poster “Just Dario” as someone who’s provided key insights into the workings of Nvidia and Dario’s latest piece on the company is worth reading in full, but the TL;DR explanation of Dario’s role in the larger Nvidia narrative wars can be grasped from glancing at these tweets about whether or not Enron is a valid comparison point for Nvidia: Nvidia says it’s not Enron. I actually agree with them, they are Envidia https://t.co/8zN308lZKK pic.twitter.com/IeahPNSd4Q — JustDario 🏊‍♂️ (@DarioCpx) November 25, 2025 I should note that this pretty much unknown (and I suspect AI-using Substack) writer Shanaka Anslem Perera got the credit from Yahoo Finance with triggering Nvidia’s now infamous “we’re not Enron” memo. Yahoo also quoted “Jim Chanos, who is famous for predicting the fall of Enron, (who) thinks the comparison between Nvidia and Lucent bears weight.” “They’re [Nvidia is] putting money into money-losing companies in order for those companies to order their chips,” Chanos said. As for “Big Short” Burry, his new Substack is a bit rich for my blood, although serious investors will likely find it a bargain, but his latest contribution to Nvidia’s narrative involves comparing Nvidia to Cisco before the dot.com bust: Michael Burry's case against Nvidia: pic.twitter.com/XafV3SLYVT — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 26, 2025 This adds to Burry’s previous X.com post alleging that AI industry accounting practices of “understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings (are) one of the more common frauds of the modern era.” And of course, Burry’s close to a billion-dollar bet against Nvidia’s narrative has impacted our story as well. There’s also been a spate of bad news for Nvidia in the tech business press. Two More Problems for the Nvidia Narrative Two headlines from The Information neatly summarize the latest issues Nvidia is facing in the marketplace, unfortunately, it’s an expensive subscription only newsletter and we’ll have to look elsewhere for explanations: The talks also involve Meta renting chips from Google Cloud as early as next year and are part of Google’s broader push to get customers to adopt its tensor processing units (TPUs) – used for AI workloads – in their own data centers, the report said, citing people involved in the talks.” Nvidia responded with a statement that is getting mocked online. ByteDance bought more Nvidia chips than ‌any other Chinese firm in 2025 as it raced to secure computing power for its billion-plus ‌users amid concerns Washington could curb supply, according to the report. The reported ban underscores Beijing’s efforts to reduce reliance on U.S. technology, a campaign that has intensified as Washington tightens curbs on exports of advanced semiconductors to China. The Mid-Wits Weigh In No debate in 2025 would be complete without one of the Abundance bros weighing in. Naturally Ezra Klein’s “Abundance” co-author Derek Thomas (co-writing with Understanding AI founder Timothy B. Lee is coming down in the middle with “Six reasons to think there’s an AI bubble — and six reasons not to” and shrewdly saves the bull case for its paying customers. Talk about knowing your audience. The Real Bulls Include Jim Cramer and AGI Crazytown’s Finest But I’ll leave the real bull case to the legendary CNBC commentator Jim Cramer (I should note that the Inverse Jim Cramer ETF has been getting killed lately). His case boils down to growth: I am a huge believer in growth stocks, and …growth stocks are what draws me to the hyperscalers for my travel trust. Now we own many, many stocks from other universes drug stocks, aerospace materials, data center builders. They have long term growth stories, but they’re not turbocharged with the resources of these gigantic companies. That’s what always brings me back to the Mag-7. These stocks are prominent because of their success. The companies they represent have bountiful profits, which is why they could rise to their lofty trillionaire status in the first place. It’s why I don’t kick them out when they’re down in fact. Or in fact, it’s why I might buy them for the trust. But the far more entertaining bull case for the Nvidia narrative is made by Utopia believers like Tomas Pueyo who is helping his 119,000 Substack subscribers prepare for a post-scarcity Utopia brought about by “super-intelligence.” Admittedly, I have an immediate and utter disdain for anyone pitching imminent Utopia but a couple of gummies and Pueyo’s stuff becomes quite entertaining. Here’s a taste from his latest, “AI: How Do We Avoid Societal Collapse and Build a Utopia?“: In the previous article, we saw that we’ll eventually live in a utopia, a world of full abundance and without the conflicts over scarce resources that have plagued humanity throughout history. Well then. But lest readers think Mr. Pueyo isn’t concerned with the obstacles in our path, there’s more: intelligence will not be infinite until there’s infinite energy and infinite compute, which will also need plenty of raw materials and land. So the scarcity of intelligence might not even be completely eliminated until more of these inputs are sufficiently abundant. Assuming AIs still serve humans, how will they prioritize? They will need a signal of what matters most to humans. How will humans convey that? Through money. … So it’s very unlikely that we’re going to get rid of capitalism. We need the price signal to convey the optimal allocation of capital. But in that world, where humans are not working anymore because they’ve been fully automated by AIs more intelligent than themselves, how do you decide how much money each person should have? I’ll leave it up to readers who are really dying to know just how many angels are dancing on the top of his pinhead to read more of his work. Just be aware that the Nvidia narrative bears are up against a whole lot of people who really really really want to believe and are clapping as hard as they can to keep Tinkerbell alive the AI bubble inflated. Unfortunately for the bulls, and Nvidia’s narrative. AI slop is having very real world impacts. The kind people notice. pic.twitter.com/bnATXesA3D — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 26, 2025 Will Americans take comfort in their 401K wealth effect if they can’t even go into a happy turkey coma after Thanksgiving dinner because Nvidia’s narrative led to AI slop getting served to the table? Posts Related to Nvidia’s Narrative: Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. RE: …intelligence will not be infinite until there’s infinite energy and infinite compute… It sounds like Mr. Pueyo could use a refresher on the concept of infinity. These AI humpers really are whacked out of their gourds, aren’t they? Krell machine or bust (h/t Dr. Morbius). The Krell data center. Pretty prescient. Morbius to Ostrow and Adams underground, pointing off into the distance: “Twenty billions,” points in the opposite direction, “twenty billions.” Adams, “Listen. Trades opening and closing.” Morbius, in reply, “And they never rest. This is one of their funding vehicles. You can feel the extracted rents rising. Look down here. Look down gentlemen, are you afraid of the deplorables?” Morbius points upwards: “Seventy-eight hundred tranches. And four hundred other funding vehicles like this one.” Later Morbius is to sum it up as: “The harnessed power of an exploited planetary system.” Beware the Monsters From the App! Lol. Gotta say: that is one of my fave scenes in the whole film. I remember thinking when I really looked at those Krell doorways that the set designer for the film had read Lovecraft. Those doors are shaped like Lovecraft described the unnamed aliens from “At the Mountains of Madness.” They too suffered a terrible doom due to their hubris and overconfidence in creating the shoggoths. Monsters from the Id indeed. It’s superb. Every time I see it, and listen to it, I marvel. One thing about tensor processing units is they use way less energy on inference. At least that might help make money on AI. ..Unless we all end up paying for openAI oracle etc. electricity bills. Well, ok, it’ll bring down, but certainly not eliminate, the overhead going to the utility cos. Won’t do anything about paying for the silicon, the optical networking gear, the programming, the training, the $1M+ salaries, and most importantly, the profit margin needed to pay back the gigantic pile of capital they’re in the process of lighting on fire. And of course, one only trains the model once (in principle) and when it’s ready tens, hundreds or even thousands of copies are made to distribute the load of inference (for there may be tens of thousands of request per second). Maybe it’s just me, but even WITH infinite compute and infinite energy, I don’t think we’d be capable of hitting infinite intelligence. I don’t think we have it in us. We’ll probably hit infinite bullshit first, if we’re not almost there already. The universe may not contain infinite energy and we cannot have infinite compute unless compute is absolutley efficient. As to BS, well, that is open ended and without physical limits Based on Zitron and Darion’s summaries it appears Nvidia and AI are headed for the mother of all busts. NVIDIA’s scheme is: Nvidia invests in some company, say two billion dollars. That company then buys a couple billion dollars of Nvidia GPU’s. Now using the GPU’s as collateral, the company borrows 20 billion. It then buys 15 billion of Nvidia GPUS. Now it goes back and borrows another 20 billion using the last twenty billion worth of gpus. or it signs a contract with OpenAI for $50 billion in compute services, and then uses that contract to borrow 40 billion to buy another 30 billion in Nvidia gpus. So, number always goes up for everybody as long as somebody can still borrow money. Some VC said at the current rate, all the VC money will be gone in six quarters ($200 billion ? I forget exactly). So when that day comes and the whole thing collapses, the bankruptcies will be phenomenal. I bet Nvidia drops by half in value, and the NYSE goes down by 30%. OpenAI has announced 1.4 trillion in spending in the next 15 years, when it makes maybe 12 billion a year currently. I think in 2027, if it lives that long, it needs a 100 billion just for that year. One interesting link I’ve read that I don’t think was mentioned was this article: https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/822011/coreweave-debt-data-center-ai aka (“I looked into CoreWeave and the abyss gazed back: Meet the company Nvidia is propping up”) This is an excellent case study for one of the companies Nvidia is propping up. Possibly the best quote that guarantees a bust is as follows: “These [Nvidia] investments [in CoreWeave] are not circular; they are complementary,” CoreWeave’s Davis wrote. “This is about an entire ecosystem all rowing in the same direction to accelerate the AI economy. There’s nothing circular about it. Rather, these partnerships are about accelerating innovation and adoption. We are, collectively, defining the next-generation operating system for civilization.” Lemmings one and all… Another interesting point mentioned was that at the end of July, Nvidia owned $3.9B in non-marketable securities–probably investments in a number of companies like CoreWeave. So I thought, I wonder where Nvidia is now on these securitiesthat they just released a new quarter of data?… $8.2B or over 100% growth in 3 months. My son is in intro accounting and a major AI user. I asked him if they looked at many corporations’ balance sheets in his class. He said not many. I said, go look at NVDA and tell me if you think they’re a $5T company. Seems like a big bust in on the horizon although I easily could see another “socialism for the rich” scenario in the offing. The companies building these data centers for companies like OpenAI might be the first to fail. They are taking on huge debt levels to build these things, with often nothing more than the contracted promise to buy compute services as the collateral behind that debt. Like Oracle, who signed a $300 billion dollar contract with OpenAI to supply 4.5 GigaWatts of computing power, deliverable Jan 1, 2027. Oracle hired Crusoe to build the Stargate Abilene data center, which I believe last month the first of eight buildings was turned over to Oracle with 200 MW of power. Another seven have to be built, equipped and made operational in the next 12 months, lol. The 4GW power substation hasn’t even really started construction yet, Oracle needs to come up with $40 billion just for the GPUs, and has to start paying Crusoe $1 billion dollars a month for the next 15 years for the construction. Good question as to where Larry is going to find the money. The other thing is these contracts are worded such that if the data center is not completed to the specs, the counter-party can walk away. So if, as expected, Oracle fails to build out all the gpu power OpenAI contracted, and Altman walks, who is Oracle going to be able to find to buy the compute power ? Nobody. Then there’s the problem that OpenAI won’t have the money to pay Oracle anyway. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being incinerated, and when the flames go out, the cold will be unreal. Maybe the IDF is helping him out with some of the jewelry they stole from Palestinians. I know that gold has risen a lot but not enough to cover this hole completely. Maybe the precious gems? A good friend who has been working in the US power utility sector recently left that industry for headhunting. He is specialising in recruiting the people required to design and project manage the power connections for AI datacentres. He said over coffee, I might need another specialism. I told him he did…. There really isn’t anyone who can do the same thing as NVIDIA, both in terms of software and hardware, and certainly not at the scale necessary to feed the hungry tech firms that demand these GPUs. Expect that Nvidia doesn’t make the GPUs themselves. They are a (great) hardware and (very poor) software design company. Their “assets” are the engineers, tools, knowhow and of course IP surrounding these chips. So, if the topic of a massive bailout comes up, wouldn’t it just be cheaper to liquidate the company, and sell the tools and re-hire everyone into a new venture? Nvidia’s real lock is CUDA, the software that you use to drive the gpu’s. It is of course proprietary and nobody has anything remotely close. I’m sure anyone who even thinks of trying will run into a thicket of patents surrounded by a moat guarded by an army of 10,000 patent lawyers. https://www.eetimes.com/after-three-years-modulars-cuda-alternative-is-ready/ CUDA alternatives. One of the most successful has been the open-source project ApacheTVM. TVM’s main aim is to enable AI to run efficiently on diverse hardware by automating kernel fusion, but generative AI proved to be a technical challenge, since algorithms are larger and more complex than for older computer vision applications. Generative AI algorithms are also more hardware-specific (like FlashAttention). TVM’s core contributors formed a company called OctoAI, which developed a generative AI inference stack for enterprise clusters, but it was acquired recently by Nvidia, casting some doubt on the project’s future. Another widely known technology, OpenCL, is a standard designed to enable code portability between GPUs and other hardware types. It has been broadly adopted in mobile and embedded devices. However, critics of this standard (including Lattner) point to its lack of agility to keep up with fast-moving AI technology, in part because it is driven by a “co-opetition” of competing companies who generally decline to share anything about future hardware features. Other commercial projects of this nature are still in the early stages, Lattner said. Worth noting that CUDA is not for AI only. To give a real life usage egzample, my brother is a CAD specialist contractor, models architecture and interiors for developers and furniture producers etc. He bought his third Nvidia GPU now because there is a lot of software that requires it for speeding up or automating certain operations like cloth physics (very useful in interior modeling). The GPUs return their price manifold saving him a lot of time. This is true. I currently am involved in high performance computing (undergraduate research) and we often discuss gpu vs cpu for the calculations we are doing. Any time you have a parallelizable problem, ur gonna wanna consider gpu. They originally became big in gaming, because most image processing is inherently parallel. And now that we cant just design smaller faster chips, theres a motivation to find more ways to speedup like parallel processing. We also optimize for memory in my lab. One of the grad students was talking about how cuda doesnt have any way to parallelize sparse or banded matrices. They actually just pass everything to cpu. Which is something they could work on. NVDA chip buyers need more years (if not decades) to pay off their notes that capitalized their “hyper scaling” than NVDA PUs will be state of art. There are efficiencies…. The short term answer to AI is reduce the cost to train your llModles. Then reduce the run cost for compute /inference. Low case “l” not typo. LLM are often too expensive for the answer they provide. DeepSeek does this with SW. The other efficiency is in the PU’s. Which TPU may be just one. OpenAI won’t make any money ever, many NVDA customers go broke and will default a bunch of bonds. The Fed can keep solvent a lot of CDS resulting from a lot of analysts failing to question Huang and Altman. While they ignored macro economics and new disruptive product profit cycles. Bond underwriting. There are all kinds of disrupters chasing tech that will bring down the TBTF. No govt bail out, which tech firm will be first Bear Sterns, ENRON? To put a 2025 technology LLM AI into a humanoid android, approximately 4.3 m³ would be required for the hardware (Computing: 1.5 m³, Cooling: 2.0 m³, Power Supply: 0.5 m³, Connectivity: 0.3 m³). This AI must be pre-trained in data centers that require about 1600 m³ for the hardware, and between two and five of these data centers are needed for the training phase. Once trained, several of these data centers will perform the task of fine-tuning and improving the LLM model, and others will handle storage and backups. Additional data centers will surely be required for this latter task. This AI could perform local inference and fine-tuning, but it would still require connectivity to data centers for model updates (weekly/monthly), data synchronization (optional), specific tasks requiring the cloud, internet searches, complex non-time-sensitive analysis, data backups, among other things. In other words, self-replicating machines and Terminator-style robots are still a long way from becoming a reality. Great compendium as always, Nat. What a time to be alive. In a YouTube video I heard the argument that this certainly looks like a bubble, and there are lots of warning flags, but those firms mostly use their giant pile of cash to do the investing, rather than using (leveraged) debt. I can’t assess it that is totally true, but if it is, then it is a very risky bet, and given that the US economy is driven by those “Magnificent Seven”, it may not hurt the mainstream economy all that much? Of course, there are many investors who will get hurt, so that’s bad. Is this a reasonable point of contention with the bubble-story or not? It’s the pension funds and retail investors who will lose everything when the bubble pops. As a horrible old Man who was licensed to run a collection agency for more than a decade ( I actually specialized in second and third placement debts, including corporate debt) I look at the Money flows. And while NVIDIA is not as blatant a scam as WeWork was, the financial relationships between NVIDIA and its “Customers” are Peculiar, to say the least. I’m reminded of Keyne’s saying that the market can stay irrational longer than I can stay solvent, regarding the short sellers. Since Sam Altman’s ultimate contribution to society and business is going to be individualized sex porn, the only real question for the business world is, what is the monetary value as a percentage of GDP? I assume we can take OpenAI being worth $500B to some investors based on his penultimate contribution of individualized non-sex porn for all ChatGPT users’ needs for companionship and flattery as a starting point for computing the value of his ultimate contribution.

Maybe that’s why the a handful of naysayers who’ve been fighting the tide, are now being joined by some major investors who are putting their money where the critics’ keyboards have been. Team Bear Beefs Up Pioneering Nvidia bears like AI scientist Gary Marcus and journalist Ed Zitron have now been joined by notable investors including the “Big Short” contrarian Michael Burry and billionaire Stanley “I killed the Pound” Druckenmiller who sold all 214,060 of his funds’ Nvidia shares. Marcus and Zitron remain opinion leaders in the space, however. Marcus is currently dealing with the emergence of a class of rival AI experts who’ve been on the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) bandwagon and are now getting off. AGI is the patent nonsense that LLMs are just a few months away from creating super-intelligent, self-replicating machines. Naturally, belief in AGI has been the conventional wisdom in Silicon Vally for the last couple of years and continues to be a big part of the bulls’ case for the Nvidia narrative. Marcus has taken lots of heat for calling bullshit on LLMs as the road to AGI from the get go, and is now expressing mixed feelings about the big names who are joining him on the critical side. Those names include Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun and OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever. As for Ed Zitron, his latest “The Hater’s Guide To NVIDIA” is well worth the subscription price and the estimated 54 minute reading time. It includes an excellent, concise explanation of why Nvidia has become the hero of the Nvidia narrative which has reshaped the U.S. economy: Back in 2006, NVIDIA launched CUDA, a software layer that lets you run (some) software on (specifically) NVIDIA graphics cards, and over time this has grown into a massive advantage for the company. The thing is, GPUs are great for parallel processing – essentially spreading a task across multiple, by which I mean thousands, of processor cores at the same time – which means that certain tasks run faster than they would on, say, a CPU. While not every task benefits from parallel processing, or from having several thousand cores available at the same time, the kind of math that underpins LLMs is one such example. CUDA is proprietary to NVIDIA, and while there are alternatives (both closed- and open-source), none of them have the same maturity and breadth. Pair that with the fact that Nvidia’s been focused on the data center market for longer than, say, AMD, and it’s easy to understand why it makes so much money. There really isn’t anyone who can do the same thing as NVIDIA, both in terms of software and hardware, and certainly not at the scale necessary to feed the hungry tech firms that demand these GPUs. Anyway, back in 2019 NVIDIA acquired a company called Mellanox for $6.9 billion, beating off other would-be suitors, including Microsoft and Intel. Mellanox was a manufacturer of high-performance networking gear, and this acquisition would give NVIDIA a stronger value proposition for data center customers. It wanted to sell GPUs — lots of them — to data center customers, and now it could also sell the high-speed networking technology required to make them work in tandem. This is relevant because it created the terms under which NVIDIA could start selling billions (and eventually tens of billions) of specialized GPUs for AI workloads. … Because nobody else has really caught up with CUDA, NVIDIA has a functional monopoly… NVIDIA has been printing money, quarter after quarter, going from a meager $7.192 billion in total revenue in the third (calendar year) quarter of 2023 to an astonishing $50 billion in just data center revenue (that’s where the GPUs are) in its most recent quarter, for a total of $57 billion in revenue, and the company projects to make $63 billion to $67 billion in the next quarter. But never fear, Ziton also puts a stake through the heart of the Nvidia narrative over the course of several thousand words. Here’s a key point: NVIDIA makes so much money, and it makes it from a much smaller customer base than most companies, because there are only so many entities that can buy thousands of chips that cost $50,000 or more each. Zitron cites pseudonymous finance poster “Just Dario” as someone who’s provided key insights into the workings of Nvidia and Dario’s latest piece on the company is worth reading in full, but the TL;DR explanation of Dario’s role in the larger Nvidia narrative wars can be grasped from glancing at these tweets about whether or not Enron is a valid comparison point for Nvidia: Nvidia says it’s not Enron. I actually agree with them, they are Envidia https://t.co/8zN308lZKK pic.twitter.com/IeahPNSd4Q — JustDario 🏊‍♂️ (@DarioCpx) November 25, 2025 I should note that this pretty much unknown (and I suspect AI-using Substack) writer Shanaka Anslem Perera got the credit from Yahoo Finance with triggering Nvidia’s now infamous “we’re not Enron” memo. Yahoo also quoted “Jim Chanos, who is famous for predicting the fall of Enron, (who) thinks the comparison between Nvidia and Lucent bears weight.” “They’re [Nvidia is] putting money into money-losing companies in order for those companies to order their chips,” Chanos said. As for “Big Short” Burry, his new Substack is a bit rich for my blood, although serious investors will likely find it a bargain, but his latest contribution to Nvidia’s narrative involves comparing Nvidia to Cisco before the dot.com bust: Michael Burry's case against Nvidia: pic.twitter.com/XafV3SLYVT — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 26, 2025 This adds to Burry’s previous X.com post alleging that AI industry accounting practices of “understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings (are) one of the more common frauds of the modern era.” And of course, Burry’s close to a billion-dollar bet against Nvidia’s narrative has impacted our story as well. There’s also been a spate of bad news for Nvidia in the tech business press. Two More Problems for the Nvidia Narrative Two headlines from The Information neatly summarize the latest issues Nvidia is facing in the marketplace, unfortunately, it’s an expensive subscription only newsletter and we’ll have to look elsewhere for explanations: The talks also involve Meta renting chips from Google Cloud as early as next year and are part of Google’s broader push to get customers to adopt its tensor processing units (TPUs) – used for AI workloads – in their own data centers, the report said, citing people involved in the talks.” Nvidia responded with a statement that is getting mocked online. ByteDance bought more Nvidia chips than ‌any other Chinese firm in 2025 as it raced to secure computing power for its billion-plus ‌users amid concerns Washington could curb supply, according to the report. The reported ban underscores Beijing’s efforts to reduce reliance on U.S. technology, a campaign that has intensified as Washington tightens curbs on exports of advanced semiconductors to China. The Mid-Wits Weigh In No debate in 2025 would be complete without one of the Abundance bros weighing in. Naturally Ezra Klein’s “Abundance” co-author Derek Thomas (co-writing with Understanding AI founder Timothy B. Lee is coming down in the middle with “Six reasons to think there’s an AI bubble — and six reasons not to” and shrewdly saves the bull case for its paying customers. Talk about knowing your audience. The Real Bulls Include Jim Cramer and AGI Crazytown’s Finest But I’ll leave the real bull case to the legendary CNBC commentator Jim Cramer (I should note that the Inverse Jim Cramer ETF has been getting killed lately). His case boils down to growth: I am a huge believer in growth stocks, and …growth stocks are what draws me to the hyperscalers for my travel trust. Now we own many, many stocks from other universes drug stocks, aerospace materials, data center builders. They have long term growth stories, but they’re not turbocharged with the resources of these gigantic companies. That’s what always brings me back to the Mag-7. These stocks are prominent because of their success. The companies they represent have bountiful profits, which is why they could rise to their lofty trillionaire status in the first place. It’s why I don’t kick them out when they’re down in fact. Or in fact, it’s why I might buy them for the trust. But the far more entertaining bull case for the Nvidia narrative is made by Utopia believers like Tomas Pueyo who is helping his 119,000 Substack subscribers prepare for a post-scarcity Utopia brought about by “super-intelligence.” Admittedly, I have an immediate and utter disdain for anyone pitching imminent Utopia but a couple of gummies and Pueyo’s stuff becomes quite entertaining. Here’s a taste from his latest, “AI: How Do We Avoid Societal Collapse and Build a Utopia?“: In the previous article, we saw that we’ll eventually live in a utopia, a world of full abundance and without the conflicts over scarce resources that have plagued humanity throughout history. Well then. But lest readers think Mr. Pueyo isn’t concerned with the obstacles in our path, there’s more: intelligence will not be infinite until there’s infinite energy and infinite compute, which will also need plenty of raw materials and land. So the scarcity of intelligence might not even be completely eliminated until more of these inputs are sufficiently abundant. Assuming AIs still serve humans, how will they prioritize? They will need a signal of what matters most to humans. How will humans convey that? Through money. … So it’s very unlikely that we’re going to get rid of capitalism. We need the price signal to convey the optimal allocation of capital. But in that world, where humans are not working anymore because they’ve been fully automated by AIs more intelligent than themselves, how do you decide how much money each person should have? I’ll leave it up to readers who are really dying to know just how many angels are dancing on the top of his pinhead to read more of his work. Just be aware that the Nvidia narrative bears are up against a whole lot of people who really really really want to believe and are clapping as hard as they can to keep Tinkerbell alive the AI bubble inflated. Unfortunately for the bulls, and Nvidia’s narrative. AI slop is having very real world impacts. The kind people notice. pic.twitter.com/bnATXesA3D — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 26, 2025 Will Americans take comfort in their 401K wealth effect if they can’t even go into a happy turkey coma after Thanksgiving dinner because Nvidia’s narrative led to AI slop getting served to the table? Posts Related to Nvidia’s Narrative: Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. RE: …intelligence will not be infinite until there’s infinite energy and infinite compute… It sounds like Mr. Pueyo could use a refresher on the concept of infinity. These AI humpers really are whacked out of their gourds, aren’t they? Krell machine or bust (h/t Dr. Morbius). The Krell data center. Pretty prescient. Morbius to Ostrow and Adams underground, pointing off into the distance: “Twenty billions,” points in the opposite direction, “twenty billions.” Adams, “Listen. Trades opening and closing.” Morbius, in reply, “And they never rest. This is one of their funding vehicles. You can feel the extracted rents rising. Look down here. Look down gentlemen, are you afraid of the deplorables?” Morbius points upwards: “Seventy-eight hundred tranches. And four hundred other funding vehicles like this one.” Later Morbius is to sum it up as: “The harnessed power of an exploited planetary system.” Beware the Monsters From the App! Lol. Gotta say: that is one of my fave scenes in the whole film. I remember thinking when I really looked at those Krell doorways that the set designer for the film had read Lovecraft. Those doors are shaped like Lovecraft described the unnamed aliens from “At the Mountains of Madness.” They too suffered a terrible doom due to their hubris and overconfidence in creating the shoggoths. Monsters from the Id indeed. It’s superb. Every time I see it, and listen to it, I marvel. One thing about tensor processing units is they use way less energy on inference. At least that might help make money on AI. ..Unless we all end up paying for openAI oracle etc. electricity bills. Well, ok, it’ll bring down, but certainly not eliminate, the overhead going to the utility cos. Won’t do anything about paying for the silicon, the optical networking gear, the programming, the training, the $1M+ salaries, and most importantly, the profit margin needed to pay back the gigantic pile of capital they’re in the process of lighting on fire. And of course, one only trains the model once (in principle) and when it’s ready tens, hundreds or even thousands of copies are made to distribute the load of inference (for there may be tens of thousands of request per second). Maybe it’s just me, but even WITH infinite compute and infinite energy, I don’t think we’d be capable of hitting infinite intelligence. I don’t think we have it in us. We’ll probably hit infinite bullshit first, if we’re not almost there already. The universe may not contain infinite energy and we cannot have infinite compute unless compute is absolutley efficient. As to BS, well, that is open ended and without physical limits Based on Zitron and Darion’s summaries it appears Nvidia and AI are headed for the mother of all busts. NVIDIA’s scheme is: Nvidia invests in some company, say two billion dollars. That company then buys a couple billion dollars of Nvidia GPU’s. Now using the GPU’s as collateral, the company borrows 20 billion. It then buys 15 billion of Nvidia GPUS. Now it goes back and borrows another 20 billion using the last twenty billion worth of gpus. or it signs a contract with OpenAI for $50 billion in compute services, and then uses that contract to borrow 40 billion to buy another 30 billion in Nvidia gpus. So, number always goes up for everybody as long as somebody can still borrow money. Some VC said at the current rate, all the VC money will be gone in six quarters ($200 billion ? I forget exactly). So when that day comes and the whole thing collapses, the bankruptcies will be phenomenal. I bet Nvidia drops by half in value, and the NYSE goes down by 30%. OpenAI has announced 1.4 trillion in spending in the next 15 years, when it makes maybe 12 billion a year currently. I think in 2027, if it lives that long, it needs a 100 billion just for that year. One interesting link I’ve read that I don’t think was mentioned was this article: https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/822011/coreweave-debt-data-center-ai aka (“I looked into CoreWeave and the abyss gazed back: Meet the company Nvidia is propping up”) This is an excellent case study for one of the companies Nvidia is propping up. Possibly the best quote that guarantees a bust is as follows: “These [Nvidia] investments [in CoreWeave] are not circular; they are complementary,” CoreWeave’s Davis wrote. “This is about an entire ecosystem all rowing in the same direction to accelerate the AI economy. There’s nothing circular about it. Rather, these partnerships are about accelerating innovation and adoption. We are, collectively, defining the next-generation operating system for civilization.” Lemmings one and all… Another interesting point mentioned was that at the end of July, Nvidia owned $3.9B in non-marketable securities–probably investments in a number of companies like CoreWeave. So I thought, I wonder where Nvidia is now on these securitiesthat they just released a new quarter of data?… $8.2B or over 100% growth in 3 months. My son is in intro accounting and a major AI user. I asked him if they looked at many corporations’ balance sheets in his class. He said not many. I said, go look at NVDA and tell me if you think they’re a $5T company. Seems like a big bust in on the horizon although I easily could see another “socialism for the rich” scenario in the offing. The companies building these data centers for companies like OpenAI might be the first to fail. They are taking on huge debt levels to build these things, with often nothing more than the contracted promise to buy compute services as the collateral behind that debt. Like Oracle, who signed a $300 billion dollar contract with OpenAI to supply 4.5 GigaWatts of computing power, deliverable Jan 1, 2027. Oracle hired Crusoe to build the Stargate Abilene data center, which I believe last month the first of eight buildings was turned over to Oracle with 200 MW of power. Another seven have to be built, equipped and made operational in the next 12 months, lol. The 4GW power substation hasn’t even really started construction yet, Oracle needs to come up with $40 billion just for the GPUs, and has to start paying Crusoe $1 billion dollars a month for the next 15 years for the construction. Good question as to where Larry is going to find the money. The other thing is these contracts are worded such that if the data center is not completed to the specs, the counter-party can walk away. So if, as expected, Oracle fails to build out all the gpu power OpenAI contracted, and Altman walks, who is Oracle going to be able to find to buy the compute power ? Nobody. Then there’s the problem that OpenAI won’t have the money to pay Oracle anyway. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being incinerated, and when the flames go out, the cold will be unreal. Maybe the IDF is helping him out with some of the jewelry they stole from Palestinians. I know that gold has risen a lot but not enough to cover this hole completely. Maybe the precious gems? A good friend who has been working in the US power utility sector recently left that industry for headhunting. He is specialising in recruiting the people required to design and project manage the power connections for AI datacentres. He said over coffee, I might need another specialism. I told him he did…. There really isn’t anyone who can do the same thing as NVIDIA, both in terms of software and hardware, and certainly not at the scale necessary to feed the hungry tech firms that demand these GPUs. Expect that Nvidia doesn’t make the GPUs themselves. They are a (great) hardware and (very poor) software design company. Their “assets” are the engineers, tools, knowhow and of course IP surrounding these chips. So, if the topic of a massive bailout comes up, wouldn’t it just be cheaper to liquidate the company, and sell the tools and re-hire everyone into a new venture? Nvidia’s real lock is CUDA, the software that you use to drive the gpu’s. It is of course proprietary and nobody has anything remotely close. I’m sure anyone who even thinks of trying will run into a thicket of patents surrounded by a moat guarded by an army of 10,000 patent lawyers. https://www.eetimes.com/after-three-years-modulars-cuda-alternative-is-ready/ CUDA alternatives. One of the most successful has been the open-source project ApacheTVM. TVM’s main aim is to enable AI to run efficiently on diverse hardware by automating kernel fusion, but generative AI proved to be a technical challenge, since algorithms are larger and more complex than for older computer vision applications. Generative AI algorithms are also more hardware-specific (like FlashAttention). TVM’s core contributors formed a company called OctoAI, which developed a generative AI inference stack for enterprise clusters, but it was acquired recently by Nvidia, casting some doubt on the project’s future. Another widely known technology, OpenCL, is a standard designed to enable code portability between GPUs and other hardware types. It has been broadly adopted in mobile and embedded devices. However, critics of this standard (including Lattner) point to its lack of agility to keep up with fast-moving AI technology, in part because it is driven by a “co-opetition” of competing companies who generally decline to share anything about future hardware features. Other commercial projects of this nature are still in the early stages, Lattner said. Worth noting that CUDA is not for AI only. To give a real life usage egzample, my brother is a CAD specialist contractor, models architecture and interiors for developers and furniture producers etc. He bought his third Nvidia GPU now because there is a lot of software that requires it for speeding up or automating certain operations like cloth physics (very useful in interior modeling). The GPUs return their price manifold saving him a lot of time. This is true. I currently am involved in high performance computing (undergraduate research) and we often discuss gpu vs cpu for the calculations we are doing. Any time you have a parallelizable problem, ur gonna wanna consider gpu. They originally became big in gaming, because most image processing is inherently parallel. And now that we cant just design smaller faster chips, theres a motivation to find more ways to speedup like parallel processing. We also optimize for memory in my lab. One of the grad students was talking about how cuda doesnt have any way to parallelize sparse or banded matrices. They actually just pass everything to cpu. Which is something they could work on. NVDA chip buyers need more years (if not decades) to pay off their notes that capitalized their “hyper scaling” than NVDA PUs will be state of art. There are efficiencies…. The short term answer to AI is reduce the cost to train your llModles. Then reduce the run cost for compute /inference. Low case “l” not typo. LLM are often too expensive for the answer they provide. DeepSeek does this with SW. The other efficiency is in the PU’s. Which TPU may be just one. OpenAI won’t make any money ever, many NVDA customers go broke and will default a bunch of bonds. The Fed can keep solvent a lot of CDS resulting from a lot of analysts failing to question Huang and Altman. While they ignored macro economics and new disruptive product profit cycles. Bond underwriting. There are all kinds of disrupters chasing tech that will bring down the TBTF. No govt bail out, which tech firm will be first Bear Sterns, ENRON? To put a 2025 technology LLM AI into a humanoid android, approximately 4.3 m³ would be required for the hardware (Computing: 1.5 m³, Cooling: 2.0 m³, Power Supply: 0.5 m³, Connectivity: 0.3 m³). This AI must be pre-trained in data centers that require about 1600 m³ for the hardware, and between two and five of these data centers are needed for the training phase. Once trained, several of these data centers will perform the task of fine-tuning and improving the LLM model, and others will handle storage and backups. Additional data centers will surely be required for this latter task. This AI could perform local inference and fine-tuning, but it would still require connectivity to data centers for model updates (weekly/monthly), data synchronization (optional), specific tasks requiring the cloud, internet searches, complex non-time-sensitive analysis, data backups, among other things. In other words, self-replicating machines and Terminator-style robots are still a long way from becoming a reality. Great compendium as always, Nat. What a time to be alive. In a YouTube video I heard the argument that this certainly looks like a bubble, and there are lots of warning flags, but those firms mostly use their giant pile of cash to do the investing, rather than using (leveraged) debt. I can’t assess it that is totally true, but if it is, then it is a very risky bet, and given that the US economy is driven by those “Magnificent Seven”, it may not hurt the mainstream economy all that much? Of course, there are many investors who will get hurt, so that’s bad. Is this a reasonable point of contention with the bubble-story or not? It’s the pension funds and retail investors who will lose everything when the bubble pops. As a horrible old Man who was licensed to run a collection agency for more than a decade ( I actually specialized in second and third placement debts, including corporate debt) I look at the Money flows. And while NVIDIA is not as blatant a scam as WeWork was, the financial relationships between NVIDIA and its “Customers” are Peculiar, to say the least. I’m reminded of Keyne’s saying that the market can stay irrational longer than I can stay solvent, regarding the short sellers. Since Sam Altman’s ultimate contribution to society and business is going to be individualized sex porn, the only real question for the business world is, what is the monetary value as a percentage of GDP? I assume we can take OpenAI being worth $500B to some investors based on his penultimate contribution of individualized non-sex porn for all ChatGPT users’ needs for companionship and flattery as a starting point for computing the value of his ultimate contribution.

Title: XRP 100x Rally To $225: Why The Only Place To Go Is Up

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP may be positioned for a major rally that reshapes its broader market outlook. In a detailed analysis shared on X, crypto strategist Chad Steingraber outlines calculations showing how expanding ETF activity could set the stage for a 100-fold move, pushing XRP toward $225 per token. His commentary consolidates a series of demand-and-supply assessments that map the structural forces he believes define XRP’s potential rally, signaling a market phase increasingly driven by institutional participation. According to Steingraber, XRP’s path to $225 follows a series of milestones. He projects a fivefold rise to $11.25, tenfold to $22.50, twentyfold to $45, fortyfold to $90, sixtyfold to $135, and ultimately a 100-fold increase to $225. Each step reflects the interaction between supply absorption and price adjustment: as ETFs acquire more XRP, price rises, moderating the rate of accumulation and maintaining balance in the market. In Steingraber’s view, the only outcome is a sharp rise in XRP’s price. While XRP’s current market performance shows a 1.8% decline over 24 hours and an 8.4% decline over two weeks, Steingraber emphasizes that these short-term fluctuations are minor compared to structural forces. ETF-driven demand and institutional acquisition are poised to create a supply-demand imbalance that pushes XRP far beyond its current trading range. Overall, his analysis frames XRP’s potential 100x rally to $225 as a structural outcome of institutional participation, ETF inflows, and supply scarcity. Price increases are essential to slow the rate at which asset managers acquire the token, making the rally a logical response to market mechanics rather than a speculative prediction. Steingraber’s series of projections illustrates how XRP could be absorbed at a pace capable of significantly reducing its circulating supply within a short period. Under conservative estimates of $33.6 billion in annual inflows, he believes that most of the available XRP could be acquired within a year. More aggressive scenarios involving major asset managers such as BlackRock could see the entire circulating supply absorbed in less than six months. To illustrate the scale of demand, he breaks down current acquisition rates: seven major funds are taking in an average of $20 million per day each, totaling $140 million daily, $700 million weekly, and $2.8 billion monthly, amounting to $33.6 billion annually. At XRP’s current price of $2.20, these inflows would allow institutions to accumulate massive quantities of the token, creating rapid scarcity. This dynamic makes a substantial price increase unavoidable, as higher prices slow accumulation under fixed allocations and prevent ETFs from depleting the market too quickly. XRP’s rising price is therefore not just a market reaction but a structural requirement to maintain balance amid large-scale institutional buy-ins.

Title: 10 Datapoints for Thanksgiving
URL: https://ritholtz.com/2025/11/10-datapoints-for-thanksgiving/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:00:14Z
Full Content:
November 26, 2025 2:00pm by Barry Ritholtz It’s that time of year again when families gather to feast on bountiful harvests and to give thanks for all of our blessings. This year, skip the “Vibes” and instead focus on market data. Don’t lose sight of nuances and shades of grey; they don’t make for great memes, but they do lead to a better understanding of what’s going on. Here are ten nuanced, slightly contrarian ideas for you to chew over: 1. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: Perhaps we are in the late stages of an AI-driven bubble; we could just as easily be in a once-in-a-generation transformational technology boom that will drive both the economy and the stock market higher for years to come. Too many people fail to recognize how challenging it is to identify these generational market turning points in real time. My favorite takes on AI have come from Derek Thompson and Timothy Lee, who looked into the 12 main arguments Pro & Con, and Benjamin Riley, who aims to “help people understand human cognition and artificial intelligence.” 2. INFLATION: Everything costs more this year — except for the Turkey. The largest fiscal stimulus since World War 2 led to the largest inflation surge since the 1970s. The rate of price increases rose by 9% (peaking June 2022) before falling back to 3% nearly as quickly. There were numerous causes of inflation, but the top of the list was the pandemic supply issues and the huge fiscal stimulus. People confuse the rate of price change with prices. We had high inflation; today, we have low(ish) inflation, but we still retain higher prices. Everything is much more expensive today, even with inflation way down. Low Inflation and High Prices are not mutually exclusive. CPI Inflation is in the 2-3% range today, but it is ticking upwards, creating difficulties for those on the FOMC who want to cut rates. 3. SUPPLY & DEMAND: We may not have structural inflation as we did in the 1970s, but we do have a structural imbalance in supply and demand of many critical goods and services. A few significant examples: Until supply catches up with demand, those prices will remain high. And that is before we get to health care and education costs. 4. ENERGY: The inflation of the 1970s was structural, caused in large part by the Arab Oil Embargo. In contrast, the United States is a net energy exporter today. In the 1970s, energy accounted for about 10% of the average household budget; the Chicago Fed found it peaked at nearly 14% in the early 1980s. Household energy costs are about half of those levels today (5-6%), even as energy consumption has increased significantly. Every power-hungry device, from automobiles to HVAC systems to appliances, is now many times more efficient than in the past. The wildcard is increased demand from power-hungry data centers… 5. CRYPTO CRASH: Given the embrace of crypto by the President (and POTUS’s family), much of Bitcoin 2025 gains can be attributed to this administration’s policies. We should not be surprised by the correlation between the President’s political fortunes / approval ratings, and the price of Bitcoin. The President has had a terrible month; from the election thumping to the fallout with MTG to losing multiple legal cases (Tariffs at SCOTUS, Comey / James case dismissals), it’s no surprise that Bitcoin has suffered a 30% crash this month as well: 6. TARIFFS: Are fascinating: They cause temporary inflation spikes and permanent higher prices. There is no getting around it – any additional tax on imported goods is a source of increased prices. And as we have seen before, even domestic producers will raise prices (Greedflation) if they believe consumers won’t balk. The good news: If the Supreme Court arguments were anything to go on, many of the Tariffs are likely to get struck down. 7. RATE CUTS: You can make a solid case either way – inflation remains stubborn at (or over) 3%, but there are signs of labor market softness, slowing consumer sales, and mediocre sentiment. Expectations had fallen to a ~20% chance of a rate cut – until yesterday’s poor data. Now, we are back to an 80% chance of a December cut. Beyond that is anyone’s guess… 8. BUBBLES: By definition, it takes a crowd to create a bubble. Can you recall the public, the media, or even the Fed identifying a bubble on a timely basis? (Me neither). Asked differently, can investors rationally believe that prices are not entirely irrational? If your answer is yes, then it’s likely not a bubble. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the AI bubble debate is Alphabet (GOOGL) passing Nvidia (NVDA) YTD returns: : 9. RECESSION: People hate inflation, but the alternative was a deep and long-lasting pandemic recession. We avoided a 10-12% unemployment rate, but the cost was 9% inflation. Consider the alternative, had both the Trump and Biden admins not cranked up the fiscal spend, people would have been furious at the failure to do anything1. It’s a Lose/Lose; whatever choice got made, half the population would have been furious. As angry as people are over high prices, they would have been even angrier at a do-nothing government letting an ugly recession take hold. 10. VALUATIONS: The Mag 7 remains pricey, even as Nvidia slides 13% off its highs. Its expensive, but it also generates $57 billion in quarterly revenues! Some sectors are extremely overpriced, others are more reasonable. The S&P 493 — S&P 500 minus the Magnificent 7 — is at 20.7 P/E. Pricey, but not ridiculous. Nuance is your friend. Safe travels!

Across these sites, we found early discounts on some of our top-tested styles like the Gaviota 5, Bondi 9, and Clifton 10. We're noticing especially solid deals on trail shoes like the Speedgoat 6, which come in handy on winter runs when the sidewalks turn icy. Below, we've rounded up the best Hoka Black Friday deals — but be sure to grab them while they're still in stock.

Title: Why Texas is buying Bitcoin from BlackRock before building a real reserve
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/texas-takes-the-leap-toward-bitcoin-with-5-million-ibit-purchase/

Operational challenges prompt Texas's strategic use of an ETF as a temporary measure while building sovereign-grade custody. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Texas has taken the first formal step toward becoming the first US state to hold Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. On Nov. 25, Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, reported that the world’s eighth-largest economy, valued at $2.7 trillion, purchased $5 million worth of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT. He added that a second $5 million allocation is already lined up for direct Bitcoin acquisition once the state finalizes a custody and liquidity framework required under a new reserve law. The two tranches create a bridge between today’s institutional rails and a future in which governments do not just buy Bitcoin but hold it. The initial exposure did not go directly on-chain. Instead, Texas entered via IBIT, which has become the default wrapper for large allocators seeking Bitcoin access within familiar regulatory and operational infrastructure. This purchase was enabled by Senate Bill 21, a law signed by Governor Greg Abbott in June that established the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The framework allows the state Comptroller to accumulate Bitcoin so long as the asset maintains a 24-month average market capitalization above $500 billion. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that meets the threshold. The structure places the reserve outside the state treasury, sets governance channels for how the assets are held, and introduces an advisory committee to monitor risk and oversight. Meanwhile, the first $5 million is small relative to the scale of state finances, but the mechanics matter more than the number. Texas is testing whether Bitcoin can be formalized as a public reserve instrument within a state-level financial system that already manages hundreds of billions of dollars across different pools. Once the operational processes are in place, the second tranche will involve self-custodied Bitcoin, which introduces very different implications for liquidity, transparency, and audit practices. The state is designing procedures that resemble sovereign-grade custody rather than institutional brokerage. The reserve will require a qualified custodian, cold-storage capacity, key management protocols, independent audits, and reporting schedules. These are the building blocks of a repeatable template that other states could adopt without reinventing the governance architecture. The decision to enter through IBIT was not a signal of preference for ETFs over native Bitcoin. It was an operational workaround. IBIT is only in its second year, yet it has emerged as the most widely held Bitcoin ETF among major institutions. The fund is the largest Bitcoin ETF product, with cumulative net inflows of more than $62 billion. Moreover, the apparatus for public-sector self-custody does not exist in most jurisdictions, and creating that infrastructure requires procurement, security modeling, and political signoff. So, the state used IBIT as a placeholder, a temporary facility that allows it to express exposure while finalizing the permanent structure. This detour is instructive because it mirrors the trajectory of other large allocators. Harvard University disclosed that IBIT became one of its largest US equity holdings in the third quarter. Abu Dhabi Investment Council tripled its IBIT exposure over the same period, reaching roughly eight million shares. Wisconsin’s pension system disclosed more than $160 million across spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, also routed through IBIT. The pattern is clear. Large institutions with different mandates, geographies, and risk frameworks are gravitating toward the same instrument. IBIT offers custody through a known intermediary, simplified reporting lines, and a clean accounting presentation under the new fair-value rules that took effect in 2025. These conveniences have turned the ETF into a de facto entry point for public and quasi-public entities. Texas is unique only in the fact that its IBIT exposure is meant to be temporary. The broader question is whether Texas becomes an anomaly or a blueprint. Bitcoin analyst Shanaka Anslem Perera said: “The cascade is mathematical. Four to eight states are positioned to follow within eighteen months, collectively commanding over $1.2 trillion in reserves. Institutional inflows projected between $300 million to $1.5 billion in near-term mimicry. This is not speculation. This is game theory in motion.” Already, politically aligned states like New Hampshire and Arizona also have Bitcoin reserve laws because they view the top crypto as a strategic hedge to the global financial system. More states could follow, as they could use their structural surpluses to allocate to Bitcoin for diversification, especially under the new accounting standards that neutralize earlier mark-to-market penalties. Moreover, the implications of state-level involvement extend beyond symbolism. ETF purchases do not alter the circulating supply because the trust structure issues and redeems shares without removing coins from liquid markets. Self-custody does the opposite. Once coins are purchased for cold storage, they leave the tradable float, reducing the supply available to exchanges and market makers. This distinction matters if Texas scales the reserve beyond its initial $10 million. Even modest state-level demand introduces a new type of buy-side participant, one that behaves countercyclically to noise traders and does not churn positions. The effect resembles a stabilizing anchor rather than a source of volatility. If other states adopt similar policies, the Bitcoin supply curve becomes more inelastic, increasing price sensitivity.

Title: Crypto Investors Watch Closely as Kevin Hassett Becomes Frontrunner to Replace Jerome Powell

Time Published: 2025-11-26T18:00:36Z

Kevin Hassett has surged ahead in the race to become the next Federal Reserve Chair, as the crypto market watches closely. Hasset emerged as President Donald Trump’s preferred candidate while the administration accelerates its search ahead of a planned Christmas announcement. With Jerome Powell’s term ending in May 2026, the stakes for markets, especially crypto, are enormous. Multiple reports from Bloomberg, Reuters, and other outlets confirm that Hassett, the current director of the White House National Economic Council, has become the clear frontrunner among five finalists vetted by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Others still in contention include Kevin Warsh, Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. But it is Hassett’s alignment with Trump’s preference for faster and deeper interest-rate cuts that has put him in pole position. In recent interviews, Hassett said he would cut rates “right now” based on current economic data, a sharp contrast to Powell’s more cautious approach. Prediction platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket now show Hassett with roughly 55%–57% odds of being nominated, well ahead of his rivals. Hassett’s candidacy is drawing extraordinary attention from the digital asset world. Earlier this year, he disclosed holding more than $1 million in Coinbase stock, along with receiving over $50,000 for serving on Coinbase’s Academic and Regulatory Advisory Council. He also chaired the White House’s digital asset working group, crafting key crypto-policy recommendations, including stablecoin regulation, taxation guidelines and elements of the administration’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve proposal. These ties have sparked questions about potential conflicts of interest, given the Fed’s oversight of banking exposure to crypto and stablecoin frameworks. Yet many industry analysts view his ascent as a major bullish catalyst. Bitwise strategist Juan Leon said a Hassett-led Fed would be “strongly supportive of digital assets,” citing his dovish monetary stance and direct industry experience. Trump’s dissatisfaction with Powell, combined with internal divisions over inflation, labor data and the pace of easing, has only intensified speculation. The Fed has already delivered two cuts this fall, with markets widely expecting a third in December. If nominated and confirmed, Hassett would usher in one of the most crypto-friendly and pro-growth Federal Reserve leaderships in modern history. With the announcement expected before Christmas, both Wall Street and the crypto markets are watching closely for what could be a defining moment for monetary policy and digital asset regulation.

Title: Paying To Observe It All: Palo Alto Networks Acquisition Of Chronosphere

Time Published: 2025-11-26T17:59:56Z
Full Content:
Carlos Casanova, Principal Analyst Allie Mellen, Principal Analyst Carlos Rivera, Senior Analyst Joseph Blankenship, VP, Research Director Cybersecurity behemoth Palo Alto Networks (PANW) recently announced the acquisition of observability vendor Chronosphere for $3.35 billion. The acquisition is a departure from PANW’s security pure-play roots, as it will now also sell into technology buyers. This blog explores the reasons behind the acquisition and what it means for PANW and Chronosphere customers going forward. This acquisition has parallel purposes. First and most topically, it provides PANW with visibility as AI systems proliferate. Security vendors can’t secure AI agents if they can’t see what they are doing. Chronosphere provides PANW a data visibility pipeline to feed its XSIAM (extended security intelligence and automation management) solution and future AI detection engines. Chronosphere’s real-time telemetry and data visibility pipelines help PANW move its security platform, Cortex, one step closer toward additional visibility. If PANW successfully integrates CyberArk’s deep identity governance alongside Chronosphere’s observability data, it will have built up foundational capabilities for the discovery, governance, and security of AI agents and agentic AI workflows. As the risks escalate around an expanding attack surface driven by privileged AI workloads, this unification for visibility and control will be vital for closing a significant gap in the security stack for nonhuman entities. Second, as PANW moved into the security imformation and event management (SIEM) market, it recognized the overlapping use cases that many SIEM vendors address: security and observability. Think of vendors such as Splunk, Sumo Logic, Elastic, and CrowdStrike, which have solutions for both use cases. Many Forrester clients use their SIEM vendor for security and observability, thereby reducing vendor sprawl and centralizing data collection and storage. Security observability and operational observability have underpinning similarities in their data pipelines. Some enterprises, especially financial services, value the crossover. Prior to this acquisition, PANW had limited answers to the observability question, but now it has an opportunity to extend its capabilities into the adjacent observability market. This is more than just another headline. It’s a clear signal that traditional buying pattens and personas are under pressure. IT and security leaders are being challenged with platform strategies that dominate and as vendor trust becomes a critical differentiator. A buyer’s journey is often a process of confirmation, not selection. Consumers and stakeholders must: Forrester clients who want to continue this discussion or dive into Forrester’s wide range of AI, observability, and security research can set up a guidance session or inquiry with us.

Title: UK budget: financial services sector reaction

It is, says the government, a budget to support working households and UK businesses. Critics will argue that it represents a £26bn rise in taxes and more election promises broken. As much of the budget had been leaked, industry commentators did at least have time to prepare their ‘instant response’ comments well in advance. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more Comments, below, from 80 industry observers range from the improbably positive to what to some may appear to represent exaggerated outrage. In the first camp for example, James Neville, CEO of Yaspa, asserts: “Today’s Budget sends a clear and important message to the UK’s entrepreneurs like myself. The government is signalling loud and clear that if you build here, Britain will back you.” On the other hand, Nimesh Shah, CEO of Blick Rothenberg summarises the measures as “the most damaging Budget in living memory”. He has an ally in the always quotable Nigel Green, the CEO of deVere Group. Always good for a soundbite, Green dismisses the budget as “a masterclass in disincentivising saving and investing.” Special mention is owed to Hal Cook of Hargreaves Lansdown, for a succinct summary of why gilts really do matter. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. Comments published here are ordered by alphabetical order of the firm responding to the budget. We are happy to hear that there will be an expansion of entrepreneurial investment schemes and a consultation on how to attract more entrepreneurs. The UK still has everything it needs to lead the next wave of global innovation: world-class talent, deep capital markets, and a thriving engineering community. What we’ve lacked is momentum and belief. This Budget was an opportunity to change the narrative, to give founders a reason to build here, scale here, and stay here. If we create the right environment for ambitious entrepreneurs to experiment and grow, the UK can reclaim its position as the best place in the world to build transformative technology. It starts with backing the builders. We look forward to the future, with an optimistic belief in the potential of building in Britain. The government could go further here, tactically focusing on industries set to dominate growth in the 21st Century like AI, FinTech and Bitcoin. There is precedent for such tactical decision-making, evidenced in how UK government support for the video games and film industries has unlocked growth and employment in both sectors. Mansion tax The Mansion Tax announced in today’s Budget will likely soften demand for higher-end homes, especially those near the £2m threshold where the impact is greatest. While the super-prime market may absorb the charge, the wider upper tier can expect renewed price pressure and slower growth. We may see a brief pre-implementation rush, but just as many owners could delay selling to avoid the levy, reducing turnover and constraining supply. The burden will fall hardest on asset-rich, cash-poor households in high-value areas such as London. “It is disappointing that stamp duty reform was overlooked. As one of the biggest barriers to market mobility, leaving it untouched will continue to create friction in an already subdued market. The OBR’s downgraded growth forecasts, as a result of the budget, prove that supporting transactions should have been central to today’s package. Infrastructure and investor sentiment On a more positive note, renewed funding for the Lower Thames Crossing signals intent to push ahead with major infrastructure. Such projects typically bolster confidence among developers, investors and buyers. Over time, improved connectivity should lift demand, and eventually values, across parts of east and south-east London. Capital flows and residential investment Rather than driving capital out, the Budget is more likely to redirect it within UK housing. Foreign, institutional and private-credit investors are expected to continue favouring mid-market, income-led residential assets, build-to-rent, PBSA, single-family rental, affordable and suburban schemes, while relying more heavily on credit strategies as banks remain cautious. ISA allowance reduction The cut to ISA allowances is another unwelcome development. Cash ISAs are central to how aspiring buyers save, and a lower limit makes deposit-building even harder. It may also reduce low-cost funding for building societies and smaller lenders, tightening mortgage availability. At a time when the market needs more mobility and higher transaction volumes, this risks suppressing demand, delaying first-time buyer activity and adding friction to an already subdued market. What treasurers and their businesses say they need from government is clarity, certainty, and consistency – particularly in fiscal policy, regulation and access to capital. These preconditions are essential for long-term investment, effective risk management and confident participation in UK financial markets. In last year’s Budget, business confidence was shaken by the stark disconnect between the Government’s positive prior rhetoric and the actuality of the Chancellor’s decision to increase Employer National Insurance Contributions. So, a repeat shock to business this year would have been very damaging. The Chancellor has largely avoided springing major surprises on businesses this year. It will take time to see whether the impact of extending the freeze on personal income tax thresholds and introducing some new taxes on property and salary sacrifice pension contributions (from 2029) will ultimately dent consumer confidence, and by extension impact the business sector in the medium term. Budget lets down SMEs Today’s silence on specific SME support is hugely disappointing. With 44% of SMEs having delayed investment decisions until after the Budget, the absence of meaningful and targeted measures today will further hold back capital expenditure. This Budget offered little to ease the pressures SMEs are facing day in, day out. Inflation and rising operating costs remain the most pressing challenge for two-thirds of SMEs, and without intervention to ease this burden, the Government risks stalling their ability to invest in jobs, innovation, and growth. SMEs are the beating heart of the UK economy, and today they needed a signal of confidence. Instead, while this Budget stopped short of harming SMEs, it also stopped short of helping them. For a Government that promised to champion small business growth in its Plan for Change, this is a missed opportunity. This is the most damaging Budget in living memory Even before Rachel Reeves stood up to deliver her Budget 2025 speech, this is one of the most damaging Budget statements in living memory and will leave a lasting impact for a generation. The 2% increase to dividend tax rates, property and savings (raising over £2bn) presumably breaks Labour’s manifesto pledge not to increase Income Tax. The reduction in the cash ISA limit to £12,000 will cost a higher rate taxpayer over £140 in income tax (assuming interest rate of 4.5% and no personal savings allowance). The ISA regime has just been made (even more) unnecessarily complicated by having a different regime for over-65s. I understand the logic but this is making a mess of ISAs. The changes to salary sacrifice pensions from 2029 are another damaging blow to business after last year’s employer’s NIC increase. This will be inflationary and lead to further job losses. It was a certainty that personal tax allowances and thresholds would be frozen in today’s Budget. I wasn’t expecting it would be for another 3 years and would drag almost 1 million people into higher rate (40%) tax. Changes to dividends, property income and savings introduces new rates into the personal tax system which add further complexity into the already complicated regime. The real impact of frozen tax allowances and thresholds. Someone earning £20k is almost £600 worse-off today; they will be over £1,000 worse-off in 2031. The personal allowance will be frozen at £12,570 until 2031. Had it increased with inflation, it should today be worth nearly £16k; and it should be worth closer to £18k. This is a significant tax increase on ‘working people’ on lower incomes. A Budget for the Labour Party – not the economy, not business, not working people The effect of frozen personal tax allowances and thresholds is severe for middle earners and has been a feature since 2010 when the higher rate band was £43,875; today it is £50,270 when it should be almost £68,500 had it increased with inflation. Was that Rachel Reeve’s last Budget? If it was, she’s had her thunder truly stolen by the OBR with their inexcusable early release of the Budget. The chaos was summed up by the Office for Budget Responsibility publishing the forecasts before the speech and leaking the entirety of the Budget before Reeves said a word. This is the perfect ‘tax and spend’ Budget from the Labour government, and today’s tax policies will leave a devastating impact on the economy for years to come. It is a Budget for the Labour Party – not the economy, not business and definitely not working people. In the hospitality sector, many smaller companies are on the brink of collapse The Budget was, again, silent on major changes to the corporation tax regime. A relief for many but another opportunity missed by the Chancellor to reduce the tax burden for SMEs particular after the rise in employers NIC in April. In the hospitality sector, many smaller companies are on the brink of collapse, and while the reduction in business rates is welcome, if not a little late, business owners with significant sums of money at risk understandingly expect the Government to do more. The latest OBR data highlights a disappointing lack of targeted support for the UK financial services sector. Despite the sector’s critical role in driving growth and innovation, the Budget missed several key opportunities: These omissions raise questions about the UK’s long-term strategy for financial services and its ability to remain competitive in an increasingly digital and globalized market. The taxing of Electric Vehicles per mile is presumably on mileage driven in the UK. The difficulty will be working out how they are going to measure the mileage since not all mileage on the odometer is necessarily in the UK. However, there is some sense in such a tax – EVs are generally heavier than petrol/diesel cars and do more road damage. Increase of minimum wage can accelerate that businesses are more shifting to AI? Gilt market shows positive impact so far but its seems a bit swinging which reflect government inconsistent directions. Salary sacrifice being brought into NIC unlikely to change taxpayer behaviour much as they won’t really notice the difference (assuming the net amount put into the pension pot) but employers will feel the pinch. Another incentive to turn to AI as quickly as possible to reduce the workforce. A problem that the Government doesn’t seem to think is coming with their forecasts for unemployment reducing to 4.1% by 2030. However, a number of these measures are deferred therefore not immediate in one way is a bit of a relief but we will have a general depression around long term investment and gloom now with every year deferred pain appearing – it is like waiting for a painful operation on a long term NHS waiting list. I am not sure the Class 2 top up scheme for pensions was a “Tory policy” – too much blame when it is not due- this is just how pensions work and was simply clarified. Freezing thresholds will actually be an accounting entry and only affect the future, but pensioner relief is welcome. On Landlords it is completely false as they are limited on debt reduction to 50% – the cliff edge will mean many more landlords will reduce stock so rents will significantly increase. She also completely brushed over the increase on people who save – why save anymore? The principle is not the same. The widely-speculated cap on salary sacrifice contributions to workplace pension schemes at £2,000 has been confirmed – but with implementation delayed until April 2029. It is predicted to raise £4.7bn in the first year of implementation. This would protect value for lower earners but for someone earning say £60,000 a year and contributing 5% via salary sacrifice, it will cost them an additional £20 a year. This might not sound like much, but it will cost the employer an additional £150 a year. I expect to see employers reining in the generosity of their contributions – for example curbing additional matched contributions for those using salary sacrifice – and a wider effect on salary increases and bonus payments in general, which is not good news for workers and growth in the economy overall. It will have a material effect on UK retirement readiness Unlike previous budgets there is no targeted support for arts, media or culture – despite the promised “commitment” to the creative industry. The proposed increase in taxes to dividend, property income and savings, directly reduce the net earnings of freelancers, incorporated creatives and content creators who rely on such investment income between projects. Where freelancers use salary sacrifice pension schemes they too will lose National Insurance exemptions on contributions above £2,000 per annum, diminishing previously essential long tern savings advantages. The budget makes it a tough operating environment for independent artists and freelancers, it is disappointing that these individuals have not been considered. The creative industry needs more support, not tougher sanctions. US/UK Tax The increase in UK tax on property income creates another large gap between the US & UK taxation of property due to difference in US depreciation deduction and creating more excess foreign tax credits. Planning will be needed around how long to hold these properties in order to maximise the use of the Foreign Tax Credits. The UK is become a more expensive location for Americans to continue to live. The decision to have Alan Milburn review the causes for ‘rising youth economic inactivity’ seems to be unnecessary. The reality is that many commentators would just highlight that the consistently high increases in the national minimum wage – particularly the wage which applies for the under 21s – together with the increase in employer NICs mean that it is inevitable that employers are considering whether to employee someone – especially someone with no work experience – more and more closely. Rachel Reeves missed an opportunity to highlight the recently confirmed £55bn of long-term Research and Development (R&D) funding available to maintain the UK as the leading partner of choice to international investors. The economic benefits have been proven: innovation and job creation facilitated by UK’s vast diverse highly skilled talent-pool across universities and research facilities. IPT tax take downgraded but Chancellor misses opportunity to support workforce health and productivity While the OBR has nudged down its forecast for Insurance Premium Tax receipts, this doesn’t change the bigger picture. The Chancellor has overlooked a clear opportunity to support the recommendations of the Keep Britain Working review, by encouraging take up of private health insurance products through reducing or removing Insurance Premium Tax for employers and individuals. Private health services play an important role in prevention and early treatment of conditions which affect individuals’ ability to work. The refusal to lower or eliminate extra taxes on the products is at odds with the Chancellor’s mission to lower NHS waiting lists, encourage the productivity of the workforce and boost economic growth. Rachel Reeves’ 2025 Budget has so far centred on a strategy of plugging the fiscal gap through significant tax increases while simultaneously committing to long-term public investment. A key feature is the freezing of personal income-tax thresholds for another three years, a move that effectively raises taxes over time as wage growth pulls more people into higher bands. Additional revenue-raising measures target dividends, high-value property, gambling, and other sectors, while spending plans emphasise investment in health, education, infrastructure, defence and technology. This mix of higher taxes and expanded public investment has created a mixed response in financial markets: gilts have risen, pushing yields lower, and the pound has strengthened against its major peers in a sign that investor concerns about fiscal credibility may have been tempered slightly. The FTSE 100 remains stable within the wider uptrend that has taken over global equities in the last few days. That said, sentiment is fragile, with investors weighing the risk that back-loaded tax revenue, elevated borrowing costs, and uncertain growth prospects could make the fiscal plan difficult to sustain. While certain sectors poised to benefit from planned public investment have reacted more positively, overall market behaviour reflects caution and a focus on the government’s ability to deliver credible long-term fiscal discipline. The Autumn 2025 Budget tightens the tax landscape for investors and entrepreneurs. Cuts to capital gains relief on EOT transactions, higher dividend tax rates and a three-year extension of frozen income tax thresholds could raise the cost of exits and profit extraction, prompting many to revisit succession plans, remuneration strategies and deal timelines. Additionally, higher dividend rates and prolonged fiscal drag also mean more owner-managers and investors will be pulled into higher tax bands, making it vital to reassess the balance of salary, dividends, pensions and capital returns. Reduced CGT relief on EOT transactions is the most immediate shift, with sellers now facing a material CGT charge that may affect pricing and funding structures. We can expect EOT transaction activity to decrease, at least initially, whilst shareholders consider if the EOT structure is truly right for their business. The Chancellor also launched a call for evidence on improving the UK’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. Engagement will be key to ensuring new measures reflect practical realities for founders and growth companies. Uncertainty is never good for banking, and the endless speculation about today’s Budget has already tested confidence across the sector. Households and businesses alike have struggled to best prepare for these measures blindfolded, but now that we know, the task is to steady the ship, rebuild momentum, and focus on making the most of the months ahead.The decision not to increase levies or add new regulatory burdens on banks was welcome, given the strong contribution our sector already makes through the taxes we pay. We have a critical role to play in supporting growth for businesses and ensuring stability for households, and today’s budget will not hold us back from that goal.A healthy and competitive banking market delivers better outcomes for customers, so we must hope that the measures announced today allow newer players to grow and innovate to keep the banking space diverse and competitive. It will be the tenants as well as landlords who pay the price for the Chancellor’s move to increase Property Income Tax by 2% by April 2027. Landlords have become an easy political target and now they will be faced with an additional 2% on basic, higher and additional rates, taking these rates to 22%, 42% and 47% respectively. For nearly a decade, property investors have operated with little to no profit surplus. Raising taxes on rental income, especially when coupled with the upcoming Renters’ Rights Bill reforms, will inevitably result in higher rents. That’s just basic economics, and it will be the tenants who pay the price. An investment must make sense financially, and when costs rise, so do rents unless tenants simply cannot afford them. In those cases, landlords will be forced to sell. This won’t necessarily help renters onto the property ladder though, as demand for housing remains strong and prices are unlikely to fall meaningfully. Instead, we’ll see more properties acquired by large corporate landlords, who tend to prioritise shareholder value over tenant wellbeing. The Government is particularly targeting the ‘accidental’ landlords who aren’t operating like a large corporation but who are adding value to the economy by investing money into refreshing old properties or creating new homes by converting the lower-demand large properties into share living. The relationship between landlords and tenants is too often considered by the government as hostile, rather than as what it should be, a valued relationship between service-provider and customer. HMOs (House in Multiple Occupation) will be hit the hardest. These landlords tend to generate higher rental income per property of around 12%-18% ROI with typical six-bed homes, compared to standard 3%-6% ROI on a two-bed buy-to-let investors. HMOs will therefore shoulder a particularly large share of the 2% property tax hikes. These landlords house those on lower income, and those who most value connection with others. Whilst landlords can’t raise the rent much whilst occupied, as tenants leave, landlords will reset rents to market rates, and as unprofitable properties exit the market, demand for those that remain will intensify. This will disproportionately affect professional tenants, both in single lets and HMOs, with HMOs reacting faster due to shorter tenancy cycles. Longer-term, we may see more properties shift towards social housing, where government rents often exceed market rates, further squeezing those seeking affordable, high-quality homes. However, people often rent out of choice or because they can’t afford a deposit on a mortgage. Unlike home ownership, renting supports mobility, lets people move quickly for work, removes the burden of major upkeep, and, in shared living, gives people the connection and support that comes from living with others. But undermining landlords’ viability risks reducing choice and flexibility for renters. The sector needs predictability and incentives to invest in better homes, not policies that drive out those committed to quality and community. Instead of adding NI to rental income, the Government should focus on measures, such encouraging councils to approve more high-quality shared living and rental homes. There should be incentives to home creation, such as for converting a six- bed property, which is lower in demand, into six single bed properties, which are higher in demand. Easing the stamp duty surcharge on second homes, reviewing mortgage interest rules, and dropping NI proposals would reduce costs and encourage investment in upgrading ageing stock. Treating secure, affordable rental housing as essential economic infrastructure, rather than a secondary concern, is the only way to restore balance and stability for millions who rely on the private rented sector. Rachel Reeves’ 2025 Budget marks a turning point for the UK economy. By increasing taxes on wealth and assets under the banner of “taxing those with the broadest shoulders,” the Chancellor is signalling that Britain’s growth model – historically driven by domestic consumption, inward investment, and London’s role as a magnet for global wealth – is shifting and so too must the mindset of British merchants. As higher earners and investors look abroad for more favourable tax environments, the ripple effect will reach far beyond London’s elite. Local businesses that once thrived on domestic spending are already feeling the chill, from luxury retailers to service providers. For many, looking overseas is no longer just an opportunity, it’s a survival strategy. This exodus of wealth and spending power will reshape how British merchants think about growth. Expanding into international markets will become essential, not optional. That means getting serious about cross-border payments, ensuring they can move money efficiently, manage currency risk, and offer customers seamless payment experiences wherever they are in the world. In this new landscape, the ability to trade globally and get paid globally, will define the next generation of successful British businesses.” Rachel Reeves’ Budget may have been framed as a necessary step to restore fiscal stability, but the scale of the tax hikes risks alienating investment in one of Britain’s most dynamic sectors, technology. The UK’s tech ecosystem has long relied on a delicate balance of entrepreneurial confidence, international capital, and a supportive policy environment. This Budget shifts that balance. Raising taxes on capital, wealth, and assets sends a difficult signal to venture investors and founders alike, particularly those who have the option to relocate their capital, teams, or headquarters abroad. At a time when countries across Europe are actively competing to attract high-growth technology businesses, the UK cannot afford to make itself less appealing to the innovators driving economic productivity. The danger is that we create a two-speed economy: one where ideas are born in Britain but scaled elsewhere. For payments and fintech firms, this is particularly concerning, innovation thrives on cross-border collaboration, fluid capital movement, and investor confidence. If investment begins to flow out of the UK, the long-term cost won’t just be lost tax revenue, but diminished global influence in emerging fields such as AI, digital infrastructure, and financial technology. In an era defined by digital trade, Britain’s growth story depends not on taxing innovation, but on enabling it to move and scale globally. A commitment not to raise income tax, National Insurance or VAT offers households some reassurance at a time when many feel they have already reached the limits of what they can absorb. Even without tax rises, elevated prices for essentials continue to erode real disposable income. Our research makes clear that millions remain financially exposed, with a large proportion unable to handle even modest unexpected costs without borrowing. Tax stability helps, but many families will still feel day-to-day pressure from high rents, energy bills and food prices. However, the extension of the income tax threshold freeze will mean that, as wages rise, more people are dragged into higher tax brackets, effectively reducing their real income. While this measure boosts Government revenue, it comes at a cost to working households whose pay packets are already stretched thin. Combined with rising prices for essentials, this will leave millions feeling worse off, even if their nominal income increases. Any fiscal plan aimed at supporting working families needs to take into account the cumulative impact of tax freezes, rising living costs, and slow wage growth. Without that, disposable incomes will continue to shrink. For meaningful relief, the focus now needs to be on tackling structural cost pressures and improving access to affordable, responsible credit for those who need it. I really want to be able to offer a contrarian take on the budget, to be able to say that if you read between the lines then actually the consensus is wrong and that things are looking up. Unfortunately, what we got in Parliament, while not nearly as bad as it could have been, was more of the same. There were a lot of small tweaks that might help some people or some companies, but which collectively won’t turn Britain back into an economic powerhouse.At DECTA, we saw in our survey of British consumers that confidence is down across the board, especially when it comes to confidence in British small businesses. This is understandable: ordinary people feel overstretched, they know that they can’t spend as much at any company, big or small, and therefore they know that those companies must be doing worse than they had previously. Consumers won’t spend where they are not confident, which will only make things worse for small businesses that lack the resource to compete with larger, established brands. The budget, with its functional increase in income tax rates and other austerity-lite measures, does not seem like it will turn anything around, so confidence will remain low and businesses will take few risks – except perhaps to head outside of the country for growth.We can see this short-sightedness in the way that the budget treated the gaming industry. While it creates a much higher social cost than many sectors, gaming and gambling is a £16.1bn industry employing 75,000 to 90,800 people, and the UK Gambling Commission has spent years developing a regulatory framework that makes online gambling safer for consumers. The budget raises taxes on that industry from 21% to 40%, and that’s going to harm, not help: less revenue means less to invest in safety measures and anti-fraud technology and may push gambling operators away from the UK and into jurisdictions providing less regulation and support for consumers. That is to nobody’s benefit.I and many others have said this at every budget, but it bears repeating: Britain needs systemic change in order to become the economic power that it should be. The big surprise is that despite lower productivity growth, the Chancellor has been able to build in a bigger-than-expected margin of error into public finances. Faster wage growth has come to the Chancellor’s rescue, boosting tax receipts and enabling fiscal targets to be met. “Budget measures will help bolster growth and dampen inflation in the short term. However, today’s announcements will likely have a longer-term impact on growth, as the Chancellor is raising an extra £26bn a year in tax. The Chancellor confirmed today that the national insurance (NIC) relief for employees and employers on contributions paid by way of salary sacrifice will be limited to the first £2,000 from the 2029/30 tax year. Currently, salary sacrifice can save employees 8% or 2% in NIC on the amounts that they contribute, whilst employers save 15% on the same amount. If an employee earning £50,000 sacrifices 10% of their salary, their income tax and NIC is currently calculated based on the reduced salary of £45,000. The proposals will cause the employee’s NIC deductions in their payslips for 2029/30 to increase by £240 over the course of the tax year. The employer’s NIC will increase by £450. While not directly paid by the employee, some schemes currently pass on part of the employer’s NIC savings to employees through a top-up in employer contributions. The erosion of these savings could lead to employers reviewing their pension arrangements, possibly leading to lower overall contributions being made to the employee’s scheme. The changes do not affect the income tax relief on salary sacrifice contributions. Like other types of pension contributions, these will continue to provide income tax relief at the individual’s marginal tax rate. This can include reducing the amount of high-income child benefit charge or keeping taxable income below £100,000 to prevent the loss of the personal allowance or tax-free childcare. The new Stamp Duty relief is positive for IPOs in the UK. From tomorrow, it will reduce the cost of trading shares during the three years after an IPO is launched. Capital markets leaders in the UK have long called for the abolition of Stamp Duty on share trading, so this news will be received positively by the City. This was a big, broad budget raising £26bn in taxes, with the burden resting more on individuals than businesses. The freezing of income tax and NIC thresholds went beyond what was trailed, extending into the next Parliament and is expected to raise £7.8bn in 2029-30. The 88 measures announced today undoubtedly add to the complexity of the tax system; there was little simplification, except the abolishment of one duty. That said, many of the tax rises are being phased in gradually, which gives time to prepare and adapt. There is a positive message around growth if you consider the life cycle of business – there were improvements to the Enterprise Management Incentives at start up, through to the relief from Stamp Duty on newly listed shares. Of note was the pioneering approach to road pricing, building resilience into the tax system for the future. There is a continued focus on closing the tax gap, with further actions announced – including a whistleblower scheme to improve the way the tax system is administered – set to bring in a massive £10bn per year by the end of the parliament. A masterclass in disincentivising saving and investing When you raise the cost of holding income-producing investments, people will of course reconsider how and where they invest. You end up penalising patient capital and rewarding cash withdrawal. This is the opposite of building a thriving stock market. The government says it wants to rebuild the pension and savings culture, yet it imposes fresh barriers on anyone who actually saves or invests. That sends a simple message that locked-up capital is subject to stealth extraction. Why would someone tie money into UK equities under those rules when other markets reward income rather than punish it? Many savers already face low real interest rates. With interest income now facing heavier taxation, returns after tax may be negligible or negative. For retirees or those relying on interest to preserve capital, this compounds the squeeze. When saving becomes unprofitable, people look elsewhere — and often overseas. If you weaken incentives to save, invest and own property, you drain the lifeblood of wealth creation. You don’t just discourage new money. You encourage old money to move elsewhere When you make saving, investing and owning property more expensive, you don’t build prosperity. You drive it away. History will teach us that Reeves’ second – and critical – Budget was a masterclass in disincentivising saving and investing. The Chancellor has added 2% tax to dividend and savings income, making it 2% higher than equivalent income tax on employment income. However, it must be borne in mind that you don’t pay national insurance on dividend or savings income, whereas you do on employment income. There are already a number of tax reliefs available on dividend and savings income, some which only benefit lower earners. Interest and dividend income within a tax wrapper such as an ISA is tax free. This benefits high and low earners alike. If your total income not including dividend and interest income is less than £17,570 pa (excluding ISAs), you are allowed to receive the first £5,000 of interest income tax free. This benefits lower earners. Today was a missed opportunity for the Chancellor to introduce a first-of-its-kind ‘AI income tax’ that would shift the burden from hard working people onto the bots taking their jobs. Instead, the Budget relied on old fashioned levies, leaving everyday taxpayers to shoulder the cost while AI firms continue to benefit from lighter tax treatment. With the National Living Wage rising, this was also the ideal moment to introduce a minimum wage for robot labour. The UK introduced the minimum wage in the late 1990s to ensure a fair labour market at a time when free movement across the EU was reshaping the workforce. It prevented ‘cheap’ human labour from the continent from undercutting British workers. Today, we face a similar challenge – but this time from software. If we don’t extend minimum wage principles and tax rules to automated labour, we risk creating distortions far more serious than anything the single market produced. The bottom line is that a 21st century economy needs 21st century labour and tax rules, not regulations built for a world that no longer exists. It’s disappointing to see the government not taking a harder line on tackling cyberattacks, fraud and mobile phone theft, which should be top of the agenda. With more investment and resource allocation to tackling these issues, the government could have improved insurers loss-rations and kept premiums and costs stable for both businesses and consumers. The Chancellor’s decision to reduce the annual allowance in Cash ISAs from £20,000 to £12,000 for under 65s has been prompted, at least in part, by a desire to encourage greater flows of investment from cash into higher-growth investments like stocks and shares to ultimately boost the UK stock market and economy and drive greater returns for savers. This will likely bring a mixed reaction from individuals and businesses. While promoting informed investment decisions and supporting UK businesses is a plus, a consumer shift into stock market investment is certainly not automatic. Demand for cash ISAs has been rising, as more risk-averse savers and those with short-term plans for their savings, for example for property, often see them as a safe home for their money. These individuals may not want to switch a sizeable portion of their funds into stock market shares. Ultimately, this move could result in people saving less. Equally, for banks who leverage cash ISAs as funds for household and business loans, this decision could create challenges, potentially leading to higher interest rates, stricter lending criteria and reduced access to capital for firms. One of the Budget’s largest revenue-raising business measures is the reduction in the capital allowances rate on plant and machinery, forecast to generate £7bn in cash flow over the next five years. Whilst most new assets benefit from generous 100% full expensing allowances, this new measure erodes the tax relief available for older assets and second-hand purchases, which are specifically excluded. Limiting incentives to new assets restricts the relevance for second hand transactional markets such as infrastructure and real estate and doesn’t reflect the desire to reuse and recycle. The new 14% rate means it will now take over 16 years before the asset is fully written off. The announcement on e-invoicing in today’s Budget, requiring all VAT invoices to be issued in a specified electronic format from April 2029, is a significant step forward and provides certainty for businesses in terms of timeframe. It also aligns the UK with a number of other markets across Europe who are going live with e-invoicing legislation in 2026. The Government has explicitly recognised the important role e-invoicing will play in supporting HMRC’s digitalisation goals over the coming years, as well as its ability to reduce the VAT gap. The announcement follows an initial consultation earlier this year and shows that HMRC is continuing to see the progress and benefits of e-invoicing in other major economic markets. Whilst not meeting Malaysia’s implementation record of two years, HMRC’s timelines align to those of other major markets who typically move from initial consultation to formal legislation in between three and five years. An implementation roadmap is expected to be published at Budget 2026 and businesses will need to be ready to engage to ensure that there is as little disruption as possible. The Chancellor delivered on the speculation of a “smorgasbord” of measures, with 44 tax measures raising a net £26.6bn per annum by 2030-31. The benefit of a smorgasbord is that the diner can choose their dishes, but the Budget was more of a stew, serving up all the measures together in one meal. The ‘meat’ of the Budget was the threshold freezes, the increase in employment and savings taxes, the new council tax surcharge and the mileage charge on EVs. In terms of sweeteners, there was the usual freeze in fuel duty and an extension of the Enterprise Management Incentives. More neutral were the changes to allowances for capital investment by businesses, with a new first year allowance but reductions in allowances for the subsequent years. Overall, the Chancellor delivered a Budget that raised less in taxes than last year and maintained the Government’s manifesto commitments, making it as palatable as could be expected for a revenue raising Budget. The Treasury Red Book ran to 146 pages but, with the Finance Bill due out next week, there is plenty of detail still to come. The budget offers a split-screen view of the UK economy: commitments to AI on one side, and tax rises that could tighten the margins for innovation on the other. Paying down national debt is a sound long-term policy, but the added tax burden will squeeze finance teams already under pressure. That makes operational integrity more critical than ever. Organisations will need clarity, accuracy, and smarter workflows to navigate the constraints. Investments in AI can also help to optimise financial discipline. It shifts the account role from “preparers” to “reviewers” and allows routine, rule-based work to be automated with high accuracy, freeing accountants to focus on strategic analysis, resource allocation, and growth initiatives. The proposed support for expanding EMI and ensuring that the tax system champions the successes of UK business, founders, and employees is hugely promising. Preserving the UK’s status as a global hub for fintech will depend on the government protecting and retaining the deep pools of talent that this industry relies on. It’s disappointing that there was no mention of any plans to back the progress made by the National Payments Vision. The UK is currently a global payments leader, and building out resilience in banking and payments will set the stage for the next decade of growth. The government needs to build on its Mansion House pledges and ensure a steady stream of capital continues to flow into high-potential companies where it can directly translate into jobs and economic growth. The Chancellor’s decision not to increase the banking surcharge has ensured the UK’s appeal to international financial institutions remains. Global banks require predictability and consistency in both regulation and taxation to plan long-term investments, which is why we welcome the Chancellor’s move. Financial services contribute around 8% of the UK’s GDP – supporting growth in this sector should remain a policy priority, not a revenue-raising exercise. While the lead-up to this Budget has hardly been uplifting – marked by fiscal pressures, sluggish growth, and rising taxes – recent tech-focused measures at least indicate that the Chancellor is beginning to make the right sounds about supporting the UK’s tech industry. The plans for an AI Growth Lab, the creation of a Sovereign AI Unit to scale national capabilities, guaranteed payments for UK startups developing AI hardware, and the decision to maintain R&D tax credits all offer a glimmer of optimism. Taken together, they underscore an intent to back a sector that government forecasts suggest could add up to £400bn to the UK economy by 2030. But sounding supportive and being supportive are not the same. The UK tech ecosystem will only reach its full potential if business leaders can rely on broader economic stability. According to the Stanford AI Index, private investment in UK AI still significantly lags behind the US ($4.5bn vs $109.1bn), highlighting ongoing challenges in attracting investment, talent, and capital. The next step for policymakers should be clear: move beyond signalling and create conditions that not only support innovation today but also build sustained investor confidence, strengthen talent pipelines, and unlock the full potential of the UK’s pioneering tech sector. Reducing the ISA allowance to £12,000 and introducing pension changes from April 2027 both risk discouraging long-term saving. Lower ISA limits reduce flexibility for tax-efficient investing, while bringing pensions into the inheritance tax net makes retirement planning more complex. Together, these measures send a signal that saving for the future is becoming less attractive. With the Chancellor’s limited scope to raise prevailing tax rates, we may see increased levels of scrutiny and enforcement being employed by HMRC as a revenue tool. It would be prudent to expect more enquiries into reorganisations, share buy-backs, goodwill valuation and business-property relief optimisation, meaning a greater focus on robust valuation methodology and tax clearances for transactional areas historically treated pragmatically. Headline corporation tax may have stayed put, but frozen income tax thresholds, tighter deductions and the effects of inflation will lift effective rates for owner-managed businesses. Increases in dividend taxation will further affect how owners extract value. Combined with sharper HMRC scrutiny, the environment is set to become more demanding for smaller corporate groups. UK budget: Frontloaded spending, backdated taxes Today’s budget was sold as a reset: headroom restored, the rules respected, and the UK put on a more sustainable fiscal path. The OBR numbers give the Chancellor some cover as the headroom has doubled since March to £21.7bn in 2029-2030 and debt is edging down at the very end of the forecast. But once you look past the scorecard, the story is much less reassuring, from a bond market perspective, though the adverse move in yields had already played out in response to Reeves’ trial balloon. Most of the consolidation is pushed into the final year of the forecast period. In the first half of the forecast, the package is dominated by spending increases and welfare loosening. The scrapping of the two-child cap from 2026, extra asylum and social spending, and some near-term capital commitments all lift borrowing in the next couple of years. By contrast, the heavy fiscal consolidation via tax is phased in late. The incremental effect of extending the threshold freezes out to 2030-31 only really bites from 2028-29 onwards: Pre-measures revisions push borrowing up and the policy package either adds to that or barely offsets it; only in 2029-30 do the accumulated tax measures and SEND judgments drive borrowing below the Spring forecast (by ~£6bn). The forecast now embeds a structurally larger state, funded in a growth-unfriendly way. On the revenue side, the tax/GDP ratio rises to a record 38.3% by 2030-31, more than 5 percentage points above its pre-COVID level. Roughly two-thirds of the post-2019 increase in the tax take comes from personal taxes, dominated by the extended threshold freezes, taxes on capital and savings income, and other various taxes (gambling, tobacco, EV’s). Conversely, public spending is projected to remain close to 44-45% of GDP, around 5 percentage points above its pre-COVID share. The slight decline late in the forecast is driven less by big reforms than by assumptions: day to day departmental budgets outside the protected areas grow more slowly in cash terms, and that a series of one-off commitments – compensation schemes, legacy COVID and energy-support costs – quietly fall away. At the same time, pressure points that are hard to turn off – welfare, local government services and high-needs SEND provision – are still moving the other way, pushed up by demographics and rising disability needs. In practice, the adjustment comes more from higher and more broadly applied taxes than from a smaller or fiscally prudent government. Debt: 97% of GDP in 28/29 Borrowing still hovers at 5.1% of GDP – dropping to 1.9% in 2029-30 – and debt now peaks at around 97% of GDP in 2028-29 before edging down owing to a one-off repayment from the Bank of England. At the same time, the OBR has cut its estimate of trend productivity growth from 1.3% to 1.0%. The downgrade lowers the path for potential output and makes the arithmetic of stabilising debt more sensitive to shocks. The OBR underlines this with its alternative scenarios: in a low-productivity case, where productivity runs at 0.5%, the current budget in 2029-30 moves from surplus back into deficit. In a high-productivity scenario, with productivity at 1.5%, the surplus roughly triples. In other words, the fiscal path now hinges heavily on an inherently uncertain view about how far the UK can lift productivity, including from AI and other technologies. Local-authority/SEND and welfare-cap risks have been acknowledged, but they are largely pushed into the next Parliament rather than resolved; the welfare cap in 2029-30 is now met with just £1.9bn of margin. In that context, the “extra” headroom – now £22bn versus £10bn in March – looks thin relative to normal forecast errors and rests heavily on late tightening and optimistic actions. For households, the Budget keeps the looming tightening front and centre. People can see that the tax state is rising – via thresholds, savings and pensions – but the real squeeze on services and departmental spending is parked in the late 2020s and not clearly explained. That is exactly the sort of backdrop that keeps the precautionary savings rate elevated, even as real incomes finally improve. Disinflation plus decent nominal wage growth should deliver positive real income growth in 2026; but higher expected future taxes and uncertainty over the quality of public services will encourage households to bank, not spend, much of that gain. Expectations of the budget were low For markets, today’s moves in gilts and sterling – volatile but a mild positive sentiment – show that the expectations of the Budget were low. On paper, the rules are met and headroom is larger. But further down the line, investors will see higher debt and a back-loaded consolidation that is hard to believe ahead of an election, especially with Reform and anti-austerity narratives gaining traction. The mix is not pro-growth as the tax rises hit savings and investment returns, and the spending path implies future squeezes on areas that support productivity (local services, non-protected departments that are not the NHS, perhaps some public capital). For equities, the conclusion is broadly similar. Fiscal policy looks more like a mild headwind than a clear catalyst. If UK-facing equities perform reasonably well over the next 12-18 months, that is more likely to reflect the underlying macro backdrop than anything in this Budget: In that environment, domestic cyclicals and UK-exposed names can still do acceptably well despite a high-tax, high-spend, back-loaded consolidation plan. The Budget itself does little to change the medium-term growth story one way or the other: it reduces the risk of a near-term fiscal accident, but continues to stymie the narrative for stronger trend growth. Banks dodge a bullet as Reeves keeps tax changes off the table UK lenders emerged largely unscathed from today’s Autumn Budget. Shares had been edging higher into the announcement on whispers that the sector would be spared – and a collective sigh of relief once Rachel Reeves took her seat confirmed those rumours, propelling Lloyds, Barclays and peers into the day’s top risers. Reeves resisted calls for sweeping tax changes, leaving the industry outside the political crosshairs – for now. It’s a delicate balancing act: banks are posting bumper profits, and few voters would have mourned tougher levies. Yet policymakers know the stakes. Push too hard, and the UK risks hobbling a critical engine of credit, investment and growth. The sector already shoulders one of the world’s heaviest tax loads. Further hikes could have dented London’s competitiveness – a point CEOs have hammered home, particularly global players who might rethink their UK footprint if the screws tighten. Valuations aren’t as compelling as they were earlier in the cycle, but upside remains. UK banks are well-capitalised, highly profitable, and positioned to deliver stronger shareholder returns through 2026. For investors, the story has moved on from scraping a living to one about steady, disciplined growth. Balanced Budget keeps gilt yields stable post leak wobble All bond investor eyes in the UK are on gilt yields for Budget day. Yields spiked a little initially, but the market has been sanguine since in the build up to Reeves’ speech. The leak of the OBR forecasts caused some volatility, falling then rising before falling again as the speech began. The 10-year is under 4.45% at the time of writing (they closed at 4.5% yesterday), putting it near the bottom of its range so far in 2025. Moves of 0.05% are relatively common. Over 2025, there have been two trends in gilt yields. Short-dated yields of up to 5 years have generally fallen while medium and long-dated yields (10-year and longer) have been broadly range bound (while very long-dated yields had been on an increasing trend until September, moves since then have brought them back down below where they started the year). During October, in the build up to the Budget, yields fell across the board. This reflected expectations that the Budget was going to contain notable tax increases and bring greater confidence in the government’s ability to balance the books in future. These falls were scuppered earlier in November when it was leaked that expected income tax rises had been scrapped, leaving investors scratching their heads as to how the government was going to increase revenues. Coming into today, gilt investors were hoping for measures that allowed them to have greater confidence in fiscal responsibility going forward, which would have allowed yields to fall (and prices rise). So far, the government hasn’t provided much by way of surprises for bond investors, evidenced by the relatively small moves in yields so far. As ever though, the devil will be in the detail so things could over the coming hours and days. Why do gilt yields matter? When the government wants to borrow money, it issues Gilts (UK government bonds) to the bond market. Bond investors demand interest in return for lending the government money. Gilt yields are the interest rate that the UK government has to pay in order to borrow money. The UK has had a budget deficit for many years – meaning they’ve spent more than they have received in revenues. In fact, there’s only been 5 years since 1970/71 where there has been a budget surplus in the UK, and the last time this happened was 2000/01. When the government spends more than it receives in revenues, it has to borrow to make up the difference. The gilt yield matters because it impacts the cost of borrowing – the higher the yield, the higher the cost of borrowing. Importantly, changing gilt yields don’t impact the cost of debt already issued. But they do impact the cost to borrow in future. And it’s common for the government to have to refinance previous borrowing as gilts mature and large maturity payments become due. If they’ve borrowed cheaply in the past and it costs them more to borrow today, as they refinance historic debt, their interest costs will increase. The opposite is also true. Higher costs of borrowing could reduce future government spending This is why governments worry so much about their bond yields. We’ve seen a couple of events in recent years where changes in bond yields have forced a change in government policy. The most obvious was the Truss / Kwarteng mini-Budget in 2022. But the US had a similar issue in April, following Liberation Day, with rises to US Treasury yields cited as one potential reason Trump backed down from his initial tariff implementation date of 9 April. Following the Spring Statement in March, it was estimated that the UK Government would need to issue £300bn of gilts in the 2025/26 tax year. The figure for 2026/27 was slightly lower in the region of £275bn. If the average cost of debt reduces by around 1%, this would save the government roughly £6bn in interest costs per year for gilts issued in the two financial years from 2025-2027. The opposite is also true. In a world where big numbers get thrown about without much consideration for their size, it’s worth just reiterating that £6bn is £6,000,000,000. That’s the equivalent of 120,000 government employees (teachers, nurses, police officers etc) at an average salary of £50,000. Gilt yields matter and not just for investment returns. The Lifetime ISA has provided an essential boost for hard-pressed young buyers, desperate to get into the property ladder. It has also proved a valuable way for people to save for retirement, especially self-employed people, who fall seriously short when it comes to pension contributions. The right consultation on its replacement is vital, and needs to ensure that dedicated savers and investors, who have been putting money away for their first property or for retirement aren’t disadvantaged by any change. Today’s announcement on the Lifetime ISA will be worrying for those who rely on it for their retirement savings. The LISA has the ability to have a huge impact on the retirement prospects for groups such as the self-employed. This is a group that is not included in auto-enrolment and so miss out on an employer contributions. They may also find pensions lack the flexibility that they need given as money cannot be accessed until at least the age of 55. The bonus on the Lifetime ISA has the same effect as basic rate tax relief on a pension and any income can be taken tax free after the age 60. Added to this, money can be accessed early in case of emergency, albeit subject to an exit charge. It’s a product has the potential on the long-term resilience of this group. The consultation into a replacement must consider the needs of self-employed people saving for retirement. They are already under-saving, so it’s important not to put any more barriers in the way. VCT tax blow hidden in small print The Chancellor has delivered a blow to investor and early-stage businesses alike by slashing the tax relief available on venture capital trusts. The Budget speech led with the positive news that both annual and lifetime limits would be reviewed to support scale up and not just start-up companies. This will be warmly welcomed by the industry which has called for limits to be re-examined to support broader growth opportunities. But hidden in the small print of the Budget document was the detail that in order to ‘balance’ this change, the tax relief on VCTs would be cut from 30% to 20% following the 2025/26 financial bill – so investors have until the end of the tax year before the changes come into force. We are encouraged by the measures announced in the Budget to support a retail investment culture, including the stamp duty tax break for IPOs, and the British investment hub. However, the tax relief on VCTs has provided many investors with the incentive to support early-stage UK businesses, which in turn support the domestic economy – just the sort of growth this Government is championing. This tax change seems counter to that agenda. Government should be applauded for EIS limit increase and VentureLink initiative Increasing EIS caps is noteworthy and should be praised. For over 30 years now, this scheme has been vital in channelling investment into early-stage companies, and by lifting the amount a company can raise through EIS the Chancellor will help ensure that the most promising scaleups – those already approaching their EIS cap – can access more capital to support their long-term growth. The new VentureLink initiative is equally positive. Unlocking more private investment into British businesses by utilising capital in pension funds was first outlined under the Tories, but proper mechanisms are required for this to take effect – charging the British Business Bank to consult on the development of VentureLink to enable pension funds to invest in private companies is a wise move by Labour, and one that we should applaud. Lifting EMI cap is positive Widening the scope of Enterprise Management Incentives is a positive move. These allow small businesses to incentivise employees by offering them share options without NI or income tax liabilities, and it’s a powerful weapon in a startup’s arsenal as they battle to attract and retain the best possible talent. In the mission to ensure the UK remains as attractive as possible to entrepreneurs and, more importantly, a great country in which to scale a company, these little fixes can make a big difference, so the Chancellor has done the right thing today by ensuring more small businesses can leverage EMIs. Good news – R&D left alone and no wealth tax For the tech sector, leaving R&D tax credits alone was a good outcome. SMEs need certainty and stability if they are to plan for the future effectively – and this isn’t possible when policy and taxation are constantly changing, so the Chancellor was right to avoid the temptation to tinker with this. Similarly, the fact that some form of ‘wealth tax’ wasn’t introduced is good news, even if the broader tax landscape has become less favourable across the past two Budgets. A targeted wealth tax would likely have a negative impact on private investments – such as the availability of private equity and VC funding for high-growth startups – making it counterproductive for productivity and economic growth. HSBC UK is proud to support over 15 million customers and welcomes the Government’s efforts to drive growth across the country. We are therefore pleased to make available over £11bn of measures to back businesses and households.We are supporting UK SMEs by making an additional £5bn of lending available over the next five years. This will underpin the growth ambitions of thousands of small businesses across the country, helping deliver on the objectives in the Government’s Small Business Plan.We will increase cashback to first-time buyers from £700 to £2000 to help with the cost of buying a home. This is expected to mean an additional £1bn of lending and builds on our programme to increase borrowing limits for first-time buyers, allowing 24,000 more customers to get onto the housing ladder. We will invest over £100m in our network – including ATMs – over the next three years and maintain our existing bank branch network in 2026. We will also create 1,000 highly skilled jobs over the next five years, offering mortgage and investment support to first-time buyers, homeowners and retail investors. We will make available an additional £1bn of financing to the social housing sector in 2026 and a further £4bn by 2030. This will support the construction, renovation and management of tens of thousands of new social homes across the country. By making available over £11bn of financing support, we can go further in driving SME expansion, helping first-time buyers onto the property ladder and supporting the customers and communities we are proud to serve. The 2025 Budget locks in a structurally higher tax environment, with frozen thresholds, increased dividend and savings taxes, and tighter pension rules reshaping how UK clients save, invest and manage risk. These aren’t cyclical adjustments, they will alter domestic capital flows and retail trading patterns for the long term. For INFINOX and similar multi-market brokers, the near-term impact will be tighter domestic liquidity as households absorb the fiscal shift. But over time, we expect greater appetite for global diversification, FX hedging and non-UK exposures as clients rebalance portfolios away from a compressed domestic market. The £22bn fiscal headroom may stabilise gilt markets and dampen volatility at the policy level, but the broader environment remains one of consolidation rather than stimulus. In practice, this means clients will look for clearer risk frameworks, more transparent execution, and broader cross-border market access. For a globally positioned firm, the Budget underscores the importance of scalable infrastructure, disciplined risk management and multi-jurisdictional market access, all essential for helping clients navigate a landscape where structural tax pressures and shifting capital allocations become defining features of the trading environment. I do not believe that today’s budget will do much, if anything, to reverse the dour mood in the British business community, and especially the FinTech industry, which has incredible potential if only it could be unlocked. Looking at what the Budget offered from a business perspective, it failed to address the long-term systemic issues that have led investment to fall alongside profits. In the first half of the year the UK’s FinTech industry bought in $7.2 billion USD in investment in H1 of 2025, down only 5% from the previous year. That seems like a staggering amount of money, but it is only a fraction of what the country’s innovative financial companies could expect pre-2021. The heady pre-pandemic days paved the way for major international success stories like Monzo and Revolut, but it seems unlikely that we’ll have other companies who can be just as successful until things change. Before the budget, I suggested that what UK FinTechs need is targeted interventions to bring down barriers between ideas and investment, making sure that the next person who comes up with an idea that has the potential to be the next Revolut has the finances, infrastructure and staff that they need to scale. We didn’t see anything approaching that in this budget, so it will be down to the industry itself to work in collaboration to build these institutions. We still have incredible opportunities to grow in the UK. London remains the finance capital of the world and our population is educated and entrepreneurial. We just need the pressure off so we can get back to work. If a buy-to-let investor wasn’t already reviewing their portfolio, they certainly will be now. The 2% increase on income tax from properties adds yet another straw to the back of an already weakened camel. A long running theme of hammering property owners with stealth taxes, higher administrative burdens, capital gains taxes and a lack of long-overdue Stamp Duty reform leaves the market very weak. Property as an asset class is a shadow of its former self, and we expect many investors to look elsewhere for easier, more stable and fulsome returns. We are very disappointed to see the Government’s announcement on another Lifetime ISA consultation. The Lifetime ISA has been a lifeline for first time buyers and has positively changed the savings habits of a generation. Today’s announcement will cause huge concern and uncertainty for existing users, many of whom lay at the heart of the home affordability challenge. We urge the Government to reassure the 1.5 million Lifetime ISA savers that they will not be disadvantaged by this consultation and that the positive steps they have taken to secure their financial future won’t go to waste. As the UK’s leading provider of the Lifetime ISA, we have long campaigned for targeted reforms to future-proof this fantastic product. In September, following the Treasury Select Committee consultation, the Government formally recognised the importance of the Lifetime ISA in supporting first time buyers. Today it should have built on these findings and committed to future-proofing measures such as an annual review of the property price cap and a reduction in the withdrawal penalty from 25% to 20%.With no broader first-time buyer support in this Budget, all the government has done is create instability and uncertainty for the only product it currently offers to support young savers. Cash ISA The Cash ISA is the UK’s most popular savings vehicle, so today’s cut to the annual tax-free limit will understandably cause concern for many. In fact, in the 24/25 tax year, two-fifths of Moneybox Cash ISA customers deposited more than £12,000, indicating that this reduction in the allowance will impact a substantial proportion of savers.It is vital that the government recognises that cash savings remain the bedrock of financial confidence and a cornerstone of financial resilience. A strong cash buffer is what ultimately gives people the confidence to invest over time. At Moneybox, we see more than a million people — many on modest incomes — relying on tax-wrapped accounts to build security and plan for the future. Sudden changes to allowances risk undermining that confidence.We support the government’s ambition to encourage more people to invest for stronger long-term returns but it is widely accepted that cutting the Cash ISA allowance alone will not create an investing culture. Real change requires policy stability, a clear long-term savings and investment strategy, and meaningful support for those who are less confident about investing. Salary Sacrifice The Chancellor’s decision to cut pension salary sacrifice will directly hit the wallets of working people and undermine the incentive to save more for retirement at a time when we already face a crisis in pension adequacy.Today’s announcement is a clear example of short-termism. By making pension saving less attractive, future generations will not only bear the cost of supporting the over 14 million people already undersaving, but also the many others negatively affected by this cut to salary sacrifice. It is crucial that the Government reconsiders this policy and delivers a pension system that truly meets the needs of the nation. Pensions From April 2029, capping salary sacrifice pension contributions at £2,000 a year is forecast to raise £4.7bn – making it the second-biggest revenue source after the three-year tax threshold freeze. Taken with the freeze on income tax thresholds, these changes will impact more people than expected. At auto-enrolment contribution rates, a pre-tax employee contribution of 4% reaches £2,000 per year at a £50,000 salary. This is very close to the higher rate income tax band, and by 2029 one in seven UK taxpayers are expected to pay higher rate tax and so might be affected by the salary sacrifice changes. From April 2029, pension contributions above the £2000 limit will attract 2% NICs for employees and 15% for employers. The amounts could be significant: the expected £4.7bn raised averages to around £1,000 per higher rate taxpayer, mostly in employer’s NICs. Faced with what is effectively another increase in national insurance, albeit only on higher earners, employers may reconsider whether to scale back the generosity of their pensions offer. Over the past 20 years, many employers that adopted salary sacrifice have passed on the benefit of reduced NICs by offering more generous pension contributions. It’s unclear whether employers will absorb the additional cost or seek to recoup it with less generous employer contributions. Meanwhile, the cost of state benefits to the retired generation continues to escalate.Today’s workers are effectively funding their parents’ retirement – without any certainty that they will receive equally generous benefits. Successive Chancellors have shied away from reforming the state pension Triple Lock, which demands an increasing share of tax each year, while implementing changes (such as the salary sacrifice cap) that discourage today’s workers from saving for their own future.” Retail savings and investments Lifetime ISAs are expected to be scrapped in 2026 and replaced with a simpler ISA product, geared towards supporting first time buyers.Lifetime ISAs have been popular with savers, but there has always been a concern that people could miss out on tax benefits and employer contributions if they opted for a Lifetime ISA over a pension. If they are abolished, the industry is unlikely to feel their loss. This is a Budget designed to encourage investment. Taxes on income from property, dividends and savings rise by 2 percentage points, narrowing the gap to earned income. The Cash ISA limit is reduced for the under 65s. The combined effect is to steer savers towards long term investment rather than property or cash. The market has responded positively: shares in wealth platforms jumped following the announcement. The UK tech sector, including fintech, contributes over £280bn to the UK economy and employs nearly three million people. After so much pre-Budget speculation, providing certainty around taxation and regulation for such a critical part of the economy was vital. The Budget takes meaningful steps toward providing that stability, which will be welcomed across a sector where confidence and predictability are crucial to long-term investment. The announcements on investment for growth-stage and scale-up businesses, alongside tax breaks for companies listing in the UK, will help attract global talent and further reinforce the UK’s position as a leading fintech hub. We also welcome the strong emphasis on AI, with the Chancellor building on previously announced measures with confirmation of further AI Growth Zones across the UK. This represents exactly the kind of ambition needed to keep the country at the forefront of emerging technologies and will be vital to ensuring AI can be deployed across sectors like financial services, from streamlining payments to combating illicit activity such as fraud. However, there are areas where further progress is still needed. The Chancellor’s Leeds Reforms, designed to cut red tape and strengthen the UK’s role as a global financial centre, received only a brief mention in today’s Budget and no new detail. Greater clarity and ambition will be crucial if the UK is to truly cement its leadership in financial services on the global stage. Today’s Autumn budget will have been watched closely by money-conscious consumers, and for many the outcome of the Chancellor’s announcement will be unsettling. Amid larger questions consumers will inevitably have around income tax, savings and pensions, we believe this is a good moment to take stock. Importantly, the banking market will adjust to today’s announcement, and major fiscal events such as this often lead to a more competitive landscape. Switching bank accounts is a great example how a healthy banking system retains that competition and value for customers. Switching levels in the UK remain continuously high, and consumers are increasingly willing to bank with a provider that better meets their needs. With today’s changes in mind, banks and building societies across the UK will review what they’re offering customers, and as a result there could be a bank account out there that is better suited to your own needs and goals. While we understand that there is no silver bullet to remedy financial worry, reflecting on whether you have the right bank account for your needs and goals is a simple first step to take, and one entirely within your control. The Government’s decision to cap salary sacrifice NI relief from 2029, as announced in the Autumn Budget, is a backward step for boosting pension saving. While the cap will mainly affect higher earners, salary sacrifice has been one of the most effective tools to encourage people to save more than the auto-enrolment minimums – and limiting it risks slowing progress at a time when the UK is already facing a serious retirement savings gap. The more significant change is the government’s decision to revisit the State Pension through a new Commission and age review. That tells us the current system is under pressure and will need to evolve to stay sustainable. For today’s savers, it reinforces a simple truth: relying on the State Pension alone won’t deliver the retirement most people hope for. People can be reassured by the fact that core pension rules remain unchanged formnow – and by the fact that consistent contributions still go the furthest in shaping a comfortable retirement. But long-term policy clarity is essential. Sudden changes and uncertainty make it harder for people to plan, and harder for the public to trust the system. At Penfold, we’ll continue building the tools, education and support that help people take control of their financial futures. Pension saving should feel stable, predictable and empowering – not at the mercy of short-term fiscal decisions. This tax rise could put more pressure on an already strained rental market as landlords might now look to sell their properties to avoid paying higher tax bills. I recommend that property owners review their investments and recalculate their returns to ensure that they are clear on what this tax rise will mean for them. While the Chancellor is expecting to raise £2.1bn overall through personal tax rises, this property tax increase could put rent affordability under further pressure as well. Landlords may attempt to offset the increased tax burden by charging higher rents. Furthermore, if some landlords decide to sell up, the rental market becomes strained, which again may lead to higher prices for renters, as well as more competition in securing tenancies. A balanced approach that recognises the importance of private landlords in providing housing and protects renters from high rent costs is needed, as both are essential to the stability of the property market. However, now that the various personal tax rises have been confirmed, this certainty allows landlords to reassess their margins and plan for the future after much speculation and uncertainty. Renters should also keep an eye on any potential increase in rent costs in line with this tax increase. Today’s announcement of a three-year exemption from UK stamp duty for newly listed shares will come as welcome news to participants in the UK capital markets. While tax is only one factor in a company’s decision to list in the UK, this change will hopefully provide a shot in the arm to UK markets at a time of increasing global competition for company listings, removing one area of friction in support of the Government’s aim of boosting demand for UK equities. The reversal of last year’s ‘giveaway’ that there would be no extension to frozen income tax thresholds beyond 2028 means a further five years of fiscal drag which will continue to hit the public in the pocket. This, compounded by the increase in Employers’ National Insurance Contributions last year, means that nearly a quarter of taxpayers will be paying the higher rate by 2030. This Budget has not been short of surprises. The biggest was that the downgrade to the economic forecasts was far smaller than anticipated. The Chancellor could have chosen to sit tight, but instead has delivered a substantial package of tax rises to fund some extra spending and to bolster the fiscal headroom. Crucially, a larger cushion against her fiscal rules will reduce the likelihood of further fiscal tinkering in the next Budget. Think tax and save, rather than tax and spend. The Chancellor claims she is ‘championing innovation’ and ‘backing working people’, yet today’s measures tell a different story. While she faces a difficult balancing act, the government is once again making choices that will weigh heavily on British businesses, especially those trying to grow, hire, and innovate. For a government that says, ‘private investment is the lifeblood of economic growth’, taxing that investment more heavily is a contradictory signal. Hiking dividend tax, freezing income tax thresholds, and tightening rules on salary sacrifice add up to a stealth tax on growth, squeezing cash flow and increasing the cost of doing business. These policies penalise millions of ordinary savers and early-stage investors, and disincentivise the very risk-takers we need to create jobs and attract investment. For companies in Fintech – sectors that thrive on investment and reinvestment – these moves risk undermining the very entrepreneurial energy that has made the UK a hub for innovation. Discouraging long-term saving and shrinking the upside for investors will make it much harder to attract risk capital, scale operations, or plan with confidence. That said, challenging times have a way of sharpening resolve. For firms with vision and discipline, this could still be a moment to double down on lean, high-impact strategies. We welcome the expansion of the Enterprise Management Incentive scheme and the UK listing relief. Those incentives matter, and the recognition that scale-ups need long-term support is the right message. To truly compete on a global stage, UK fintech and innovation need a world-beating, simple, and ambitious incentive regime. We hope today is the first step in that conversation, not the end of it. Budget reforms should incentivise saving without adding additional burdens While the Chancellor’s push to incentivise young, working Britons to invest their money is laudable, a reduction to cash ISA limits is only effective if it comes with a far-reaching educational campaign to demystify investing. The forthcoming changes to financial advice and the launch of online hubs may well help encourage broader participation in non-cash assets, but we should not penalise diligent savers by pushing their cash into taxable environments, as this will serve to increase the tax burden on working Britons, decreasing national consumption. As the Chancellor said in her speech, the UK has the lowest retail investment rates in the G7, with under a quarter of British adults holding stocks. The increase in the dividend tax rate announced today is a further disincentive to investment, particularly for small businesses owners who take their income via dividends. To counterbalance this and show entrepreneurs that Britain is a good home for business, the Government should also consider increasing CGT allowances. The Chancellor’s decision to introduce a yearly cap on National Insurance-free salary sacrifice will similarly impact our savings rates, a move which will be detrimental to UK stock markets and everyday people alike. With Britons presently struggling to save for retirement, adding an extra burden will undermine long-term financial security and create additional barriers to saving. Failing to introduce dedicated RegTech R&D tax credits is not just a significant missed opportunity, but also a strategic oversight. Innovate Finance and voices across the industry have been clear about what founders need. According to KPMG, RegTech is gaining significant investor interest, especially across EMEA, as regulatory compliance grows more complex. The UK has everything required to lead, but without targeted support, we hand a competitive advantage to jurisdictions moving faster to back next-generation compliance technology. Greater clarity on capital gains treatment, entrepreneur relief, and modernised EIS/EMI rules is exactly what founders have been calling for. This is a strong signal that the Government recognises how vital fiscal stability is for scaling high-growth sectors like RegTech. This makes the UK an even more attractive place to build and scale financial innovation and reinforces London’s position as the natural home for RegTech globally. Any steps to tackle financial hardship via reversals to previous cuts to winter fuel payments and the scrapping of the two-child benefit cap are positive, but the OBR predicts that the latter will only impact 560,000 families. Balancing the books is no easy task, however the Chancellor’s previous warning that ‘everyone will have to contribute’ overlooks what it takes to boost confidence. Over 20 million UK consumers are currently classed as financially vulnerable but tend to fall between the cracks of the system. They are not on the breadline, they have steady jobs, they are financially responsible. Yet they are locked out of mainstream credit because of fundamental flaws in how the industry operates and therefore prevented from ‘contributing’ via spending. If there is to be true commitment to boosting productivity, it should start by a broader look at addressing financial exclusion – £6.4bn could be added to UK GDP by doing so. Pulling tax levers just won’t cut it, so it’s imperative that the Government collaborates with lenders and credit rating agencies to facilitate better lending practices. Gilts calm for now, sterling posts month-high post-Budget, Wall St rallies Post-Budget, gilt markets seem reasonably quiet though we have seen a slight tick-up in yields this morning after declining yesterday. Sterling trades at its best in a month against the dollar, though has come back off the overnight highs this morning to $1.3223. EURGBP has seen less of a move as it ran up against the 50-day SMA support, a three-week high for the pound. The FTSE 250 has risen but the FTSE 100 dipped early on Thursday following two days of solid progress.The Budget was frontloaded with spending and backloaded with paying for it Borrowing will rise, according to the OBR and issuance next year is sharply higher, according to the DMO. So why are gilt yields down and the pound at a month high? It’s probably down to a reduction in the political risk associated with the Starmer/Reeves leadership, which has been key to holding the bond market on a relatively tight leash.That doesn’t mean political risk has gone away with this patchwork of tax hikes and giveaways – start pulling at the threads and the whole thing might unravel. There are assumptions about growth that are too optimistic and about welfare policy that probably won’t stand up to reality or scrutiny, moreover there is myriad of complications with implementation of say, the ISA changes, or salary sacrifice reform. Take the Send budget – the OBR warns of a “significant fiscal risk” as the government has not set out how it plans to pay for extra spending. There is a black hole looming at the Department for Education. The govt seems content to worry about that in 2028.I still believe the entire assumption around spend now and pay for it later won’t survive deeper scrutiny from the markets. The Budget does nothing to fundamentally improve the UK’s fiscal position, boost growth, or improve the twin deficits – but it seems it has bought the Chancellor some grace and lower bond yields will buy her some extra headroom. That is maybe the best she could have hoped for aftera Budget that does a) nothing to boost growth, b) nothing to cut spending, and actually raises, c) raises taxation on the most productive parts of the economy, d) implies reform of welfare that the government has signally failed to deliver so far, and e) offers broad assumptions that do not seem credible at all given the election cycle.The market for now is rewarding more fiscal headroom with lower yields, but I would note that the move in the US 10yr yesterday, which spiked and then settled below 4%, was pretty close to that of the 10yr gilt. Today is Thanksgiving so there should be little from the US until Monday. Gilts will have to manage on their own for a day or two. Bookmaker stocks are down The sector has issued warnings about the impact of tax hikes. The Chancellor announced yesterday that Remote Gaming Duty is set to increase from 21% to 40% from April 2026, and a new online sports betting duty of 25% will be applicable to sports excluding horse racing from April 2027, replacing the existing 15% General Betting Duty. Flutter reports impact before mitigation to be approximately $320m in fiscal 2026 and $540m in fiscal 2027. Evoke, which tumbled yesterday on the news, estimates a hit of approximately £125-135m on an annualised basis once fully implemented from April 2027 and pulled its medium-term guidance. Entain put the damage at £200m next year and £100m this year. Rank, which owns Gala bingo, fell 10% after saying the measures will hurt operating profit by £40m.The FTSE 100 was flat just shy of 9,700 in early trade on Thursday before turning lower after two solid days of gains. Bank shares continued to gain after popping yesterday as they were spared from a tax raid. JPMorgan, with impeccable timing, says it will open a giant new skyscraper in Canary Wharf. Clearly the banks bought the three-line whip on supporting the Budget. Maybe they’re also buying gilts? US markets are back on track The S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq each posting a fourth straight day of gains on Wednesday. Nvidia picked up some bid to rise 1.4%, while Oracle arrested its decline to rally 4% as Deutsche Bank said the pullback in shares “presents an attractive entry point for investors when looking at Oracle’s business in totality. Today’s Budget measures are a starting point at attempting to reinvigorate the business, and subsequently, fintech, ecosystem. The three-year stamp duty holiday for new share listings, for example, is a positive move, but it only helps IPO-ready businesses on the path to listing. To fuel the next generation of fast-growth fintechs, more needs to be done to help earlier stage businesses. We sincerely hope that the consultation to increase support for scale ups and attract more entrepreneurs happens swiftly so that the UK stands a chance at being a destination for innovation and growth. As many speculated, the Autumn Budget has highlighted tough economic conditions and delivered fresh challenges for UK businesses to face. Many businesses, particularly SMBs, will be impacted by the rise in national minimum wage, cap on NI exemption for the pension salary sacrifice and the slash on WDAs (writing down allowances). In response, some companies may panic pivot to blunt cost-cutting measures like hiring freezes or redundancies, but that approach risks damaging long-term growth. Our recent research found that 88% of UK finance leaders believe restricting employees’ access to budgets actually stifles business growth. Because when smart spending is hindered or put on hold, opportunities get delayed and productivity suffers. The focus therefore shouldn’t be on hastily cutting costs, but being smarter about where spend goes. By investing in transparent spend management tools and empowering teams with real-time visibility and control, businesses can protect efficiency and make every pound work harder. Financial control is about making informed, proactive decisions that safeguard efficiency and growth, even in uncertain times. This is a moment for sensible reform of the Lifetime ISA, not a rush to scrap it. LISAs have helped a generation of first-time buyers save for a deposit and, crucially, given many – particularly the self-employed – a simple, engaging way to build retirement savings. As the government consults on a new ISA for homebuyers, it must protect the strengths of the LISA and give clarity and fair treatment to existing savers – not dismantle a product that is already delivering for those trying to save for both a first home and later life. As a lender to mid-sized businesses, the key question from today’s Budget for us is whether it will support growth and encourage borrowing. Judging by the policies announcement, it will be a challenge for many, more so for smaller businesses, who are less resilient and are already addressing higher taxes and employee costs. This is alongside the proposals to strengthen employee rights. Salary sacrifice changes will add further costs to business, while undermining pension savings – at a time when we want pension schemes to be investing in UK assets and growth businesses. Changes to CGT rules on Employee Ownership Trusts (EOTs) will undoubtedly dampen what has become a popular route for owner and family managed businesses exploring a sale, albeit we may see an acceleration in deals before the new rules take effect in April. There are some positives – notably the freezing of fuel duty, rate relief for small businesses and strengthening the Enterprise Management Incentive, but these pale in comparison. This is not going to stop businesses from growing, acquiring and investing, especially mid-sized businesses who will be planning years in advance, but for certain sectors and for companies at different points of the cycle, it will delay plans and reduce borrower appetite. As many expected, today’s Budget has delivered tax increases totalling £26bn in an effort to tackle debt and protect public services, leaving businesses understandably on alert. Many will now have little choice but to reassess their plans for the 2026 financial year and look closely at where they can drive efficiencies. Our recent research shows that 70% of UK finance professionals believe outdated finance processes are limiting growth, yet nearly half (47%) still rely on manual or mostly manual systems. In a volatile economic environment, that’s a real concern, especially as 51% say global trade pressures like tariffs are already hindering expansion plans. Combined with fiscal uncertainty at home, the need for agility has never been greater. This is exactly the kind of fiscal uncertainty that exposes the weaknesses of manual finance operations. Automation gives leaders the visibility and foresight they need to make better decisions, faster. By modernising their operations now, UK businesses can build resilience and stay one step ahead, whatever direction future Budgets take. We recognise the Chancellor faced tough choices in this Budget and welcome the ongoing support she has shown for the financial services sector. This sends an important signal to international markets that the UK is focused on growth and attracting investment. The changes to Stamp Duty for newly-listed companies will help encourage more trading in UK companies. A strong economy needs a strong financial sector, which in turn backs jobs, businesses and the whole economy. We look forward to continuing to work in partnership with the government to support its growth mission and the wider economy. If we want AI to genuinely raise productivity, the government must go beyond investment and needs to become an enthusiastic customer for startups. As an AI founder, I see daily how much potential there is to make public services and regulated industries more efficient. If the UK wants to build and keep world-leading AI companies, procurement frameworks must reward technologies that deliver trustworthy, consistent automation. As well as capital, founders need customers willing to adopt, test and scale innovative products. By using its own buying power, alongside targeted R&D programmes, the government can set the pace for the wider economy. That’s the clearest way to ensure the UK remains a global home for ambitious, high-growth companies. The Autumn Budget delivered by the UK Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has introduced a series of tax changes that could significantly impact savers, investors, landlords, and business owners. While Reeves technically upheld her election promise not to raise income tax for working people, the extension of the income tax threshold freeze until 2031 has allowed fiscal drag to quietly increase tax burdens.From April 2026, income tax on dividends will rise by two percentage points for basic and higher rate taxpayers (note: the additional rate applicable to dividends will remain at 39.35%), while income tax on savings and rental income (land & buildings) will rise by two percentage points for basic, high rate and additional rate taxpayers from April 2027. This move is set to affect savers, investors, business owners, and landlords, prompting many to reassess their financial strategies. With capital gains tax rates left unchanged, investors may now be encouraged to scrutinise how gains are generated within their portfolios. Savers, too, might consider shifting cash holdings into more tax-efficient structures, such as ISAs or offshore bonds, to mitigate the impact of these changes. Landlords: The outlook remains challenging The additional 2% income tax on rental income compounds the existing tax burdens, including higher stamp duty rates, capital gains tax on property sales, and inheritance tax (IHT) on death. Non-professional landlords holding properties in their own names may find this an opportune moment to evaluate the profitability of their rental portfolios and explore alternative, more tax-efficient structuring options. On a more positive note, the government has refined its approach to business and agricultural property reliefs. Following extensive consultation, the rules now allow for the full spousal / civil partner transfer of the £1m IHT allowance. This change aligns these reliefs more closely with the broader IHT framework and provides a valuable tool for effective estate planning. Savers under the age of 65 will face new restrictions on cash ISA allowances, which will be capped at £12,000 annually from April 2027, with an additional £8,000 allowance for investment ISAs. Coupled with the cap on national insurance contribution (NIC) relief on salary sacrifice into pension schemes to the first £2,000 of pension contributions (from 2029), these changes may encourage a shift in mindset, positioning ISAs as complementary retirement savings vehicles alongside pensions. Despite the pre-Budget speculation, the announcements were less dramatic than anticipated. Key elements of the tax landscape, such as tax-free cash, potentially exempt transfers & the seven-year rule, and capital gains tax rates, remain unchanged. For those affected by the new measures, this Budget presents an opportunity to revisit financial plans, optimise tax efficiency, and ensure wealth is structured effectively for the future. As the dust settles, the focus will now shift to how individuals and businesses can adapt to these changes and make the most of the planning opportunities they present. Taken together, these two measures appear to be an acknowledgement that the changes announced in last year’s Budget to the non-dom regime went too far, that the UK has lost too many of these individuals, and that policymakers have to do more to stem this outflow and get the country back to becoming an attractive destination for wealth. This is particularly important given the country’s top 1% of taxpayers contribute to a third of all tax revenue. However, questions marks remain as to whether these measures will be effective in restoring trust among non-doms and the wider HNW community and prevent further departures. The £5m cap, while limiting the amount non-doms may ultimately have to settle, still represents a significant new charge for individuals who previously paid nothing before April 2025. Additionally, with the Government announcing £26 billion of tax-raising measures in this Budget alone, it is difficult to see how this will encourage new wealthy individuals to move to the UK. With the Chancellor on the hunt at this Budget for tax rises to help plug the fiscal hole – largely borne by the shoulders of the wealthiest – it is no surprise that the Capital Gains Tax regime has been revisited, including the reduction of capital gains relief on disposals to employee ownership trusts from 100% to 50%. These further changes could materially impact behaviours around investment. Those affected will need to act swiftly, reassessing and adapting their financial plans to navigate the UK’s evolving tax environment. On Inheritance Tax statistics IHT receipts are forecast to raise £9bn in 2025/26, a 4.5% increase from last year with receipts expected to continue to increase over the forecast period, driven by rising house and equity prices and the impact of the polices announced at the Autumn Budget 2024 reaching £14.5bn in 2030/31. Relative to the OBR’s March forecast, receipts are expected to be £0.8bn lower by 2029/30 due to lower in-year outturn which is only partially offset by higher forecast equity prices. Inheritance Tax receipts are set to increase from last year and over the forecast period as frozen thresholds, rising asset prices, a tightening of the regime at the Autumn 2024 Budget and extending the freeze on IHT free allowances combine to drive increasing collections for the Treasury. It sets the scene for continued demand for professional advice as high-net-worth clients look to understand how they may be impacted. The £8,000 element reserved for investment is a helpful measure that adds to the growing momentum in the London IPO market with companies and investors once again eyeing the longer-term attractiveness of the UK as a listing venue. It builds on the recent regulatory changes enacted by the FCA and LSE that have levelled the playing field with other leading listing venues and strengthened London’s competitiveness. In particular, this measure should support greater retail investor participation in the stock market, boost liquidity, access to capital for companies and bring the UK more in line with other successful jurisdictions with strong cultures of retail investing. Today’s Budget sends a clear and important message to the UK’s entrepreneurs like myself. The government is signalling loud and clear that if you build here, Britain will back you. As a British‑founded business, Yaspa welcomes this commitment and is proud to be part of a community that drives innovation, creates jobs, and grows the economy. We are excited to continue to grow and expand, and we look forward to engaging actively in the discussions the government has launched. Support like this will help unlock long‑term investment, give UK start‑ups the chance to scale, and ensure businesses like ours can hire, innovate, and invest in the future of Britain.

Title: Bitcoin Hyper Boosts as Texas Is First US State to Buy Bitcoin

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: Texas just became the first US state to buy bitcoin, doing it not through a cold wallet but via BlackRock’s spot $BTC ETF. For institutions and treasuries, that’s a historic green light: clean regulatory rails, audited custody, and Bitcoin exposure that fits neatly into a traditional portfolio. For you as a retail investor, though, ETFs cap the upside. You get price tracking, not yield, leverage, or early-stage asymmetry. That’s why early-stage Bitcoin infrastructure plays are suddenly back in focus. Instead of just holding ‘paper BTC’ via an ETF, some are rotating into projects trying to fix Bitcoin’s biggest pain points: slow confirmation times, rising on-chain fees, and a scripting model that makes complex DeFi almost impossible. That’s the gap Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is aiming to fill. As more headlines frame Texas’s move as the start of state-level Bitcoin adoption and another win for institutional adoption, a parallel conversation is happening in crypto-native circles. If institutions are content with ETF exposure, can agile investors position one layer closer to the innovation stack, into Bitcoin Layer 2s like Bitcoin Hyper, where the risk is higher but so is the potential upside? Texas opting for a BlackRock ETF underscores a simple reality: institutions want Bitcoin exposure without on-chain friction. However, the Bitcoin base layer still processes around 7 transactions per second, with confirmation times measured in minutes and fees often spiking to several dollars when mempools become congested. That performance gap is exactly where Bitcoin Layer 2 projects are racing to compete. You’re already seeing multiple design paths emerge: pure payments, sidechains targeting EVM developers, and newer rollup-style architectures trying to anchor security on Bitcoin while offloading execution. In that mix, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)-powered option, aimed at high-frequency, Solana-style workloads, but has settled back on Bitcoin. Where many Bitcoin L2 designs bolt on EVM, Bitcoin Hyper takes a different route: integrating the Solana Virtual Machine so developers can deploy high-throughput Rust smart contracts on a Bitcoin-secured stack. Under the hood, Bitcoin Hyper uses a modular approach: Bitcoin L1 acts as the settlement and security anchor, while a single trusted sequencer orders and executes transactions off-chain before periodically anchoring state to Bitcoin. That design enables sub-second finality, low-cost swaps, lending, gaming, and NFT trades in wrapped $BTC, while still inheriting Bitcoin’s base-layer trust assumptions. This is where investors start running the ETF-versus-early-stage math. The Bitcoin Hyper presale has already raised $28.5M with tokens at $0.013335, suggesting some market conviction that a Bitcoin-native SVM chain could capture meaningful DeFi and dApp flows. If Bitcoin continues to institutionalize via ETFs, the next leverage point for growth may be infrastructure that turns idle BTC into productive capital. That’s the bet behind $HYPER: that users will want fast swaps, lending, staking, and gaming in BTC terms, not just passive price exposure. Learn more about Bitcoin Hyper or join the $HYPER presale.

Title: HP Joins Big Tech Companies Laying Off Workers Amid AI Push

Computer and printer maker HP's (HPQ) stock slid Wednesday, a day after the company announced a major cost-cutting plan that includes layoffs. The company said it aims to eliminate between 4,000 and 6,000 roles as part of its efforts to save $1 billion over the next three fiscal years. For HP, which said it had about 58,000 employees in its latest annual filing, the cuts could represent up to 10% of its workforce. Meanwhile, CEO Enrique Lores told investors during Tuesday's earnings call that the company plans to continue investing in AI-related initiatives as it sees "a significant opportunity to embed AI into HP to accelerate product innovation, improve customer satisfaction, and boost productivity," according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. The move makes HP the latest tech company to announce layoffs despite business looking solid in its latest quarter, highlighting what could be growing trend. A number of tech giants, including Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), have also undertaken layoffs in recent months, while ramping up their AI efforts. The flurry of recent layoffs could point to growing pressure on tech companies to make cuts where they can to help support their spending on AI, while some may be expecting the technology could reduce the need for some roles over time. HP reported better revenue than expected at $14.6 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter. Its adjusted earnings per share of $0.93 was also slightly above analysts' expectations compiled by Visible Alpha. The company's profit outlook of $2.90 to $3.20 in EPS for fiscal 2026, however, came in below the analyst consensus. HP shares were down about 2% in recent trading, bring their year-to-date losses close to 27%.

Title: Lefty NYC Comptroller Brad Lander tells top pension funds to cut ties with BlackRock over climate stance

New York City’s far-left outgoing Comptroller Brad Lander wants three of the city’s top pension funds to cut ties with BlackRock over allegations that the world’s largest money manager is not doing enough to fight climate change. The pol, who unsuccessfully ran for mayor this year, blasted the Larry Fink-led firm on Wednesday for allegedly buckling to pressure from the White House and Republicans and U-turning on green investments. “Climate risk is financial risk. You can see it all around you in an increased number of flash floods and wildfires,” Lander, whose term ends Dec. 31, told Bloomberg. The left-winger — who recently admitted he’s mulling a congressional run — accused BlackRock of scaling back “climate engagement in ways that put our investments at risk needlessly.” Lander urged the New York City Employees’ Retirement System, Teachers’ Retirement System and Board of Education Retirement System to shift their investments to rivals with a “more robust approach” to combating global warming. BlackRock Managing Director Armando Senra slammed the comptroller’s remarks as “another instance of the politicization of public pension funds, which undermines the retirement security of hardworking New Yorkers,” according to a letter posted on the firm’s website. The Post has sought comment from BlackRock. Lander also wants some of the funds to cut ties with Fidelity Investments and PanAgora Asset Management, claiming that they, too, are not doing enough to help the environment. Neither has publicly commented. Lander cannot actually force the pension funds to take his suggestions — trustees of each one make the final decision. Socialist Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and his appointees will get some say over the Big Apple’s $300 billion pension system, Bloomberg noted. After losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani, Lander became a strong backer of the capitalism-hating mayor-elect, who takes office Jan. 1. BlackRock oversees some $42.3 billion in city worker retirement funds. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email.

Its assets under management worldwide hit a company record $13.46 trillion on Sept. 30, boosted by a rally in global markets and dealmaking income. The money manager, like many other Wall Street firms during the Biden administration, was a lightning rod for GOP lawmakers over its stance on DEI programs and Environmental Social Governance investing, known by its acronym ESG. The Securities and Exchange Commission, under President Trump-picked chair Paul Atkins, backed off on enforcing Biden-era ESG disclosure rules as part of a White House-led crackdown on ‘woke’ capitalism At the start of the year, just before Trump took office for a second time, BlackRock withdrew from a United Nations-backed Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative that aimed to pressure major corporations to reduce their carbon footprint. Then in June, the company was removed from Texas’ investment “blacklist” after it scaled back its climate commitments. Lander will be succeeded by current Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, who also endorsed Mamdani. Levine’s role will be to act as an independent spending watchdog and ensure New Yorkers get the most bang for their buck while Mamdani pursues his aggressive socialist agenda, which includes rent freezes, free public buses, expanded free childcare and more. Levine did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Landers’ BlackRock stance. Advertisement

Title: A.I. Leaders Warn Entry-Level White-Collar Jobs Are Being Automated Away

The technology industry, once a landing pad for fresh computer science graduates, is rapidly automating away its early-career talent pipeline. A.I. coding tools like GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer now handle much of the entry-level work junior engineers once did, making it increasingly difficult for young professionals to break in.

By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The impact isn’t limited to computer engineers. Earlier this month, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei offered a stark prediction on 60 Minutes, reiterating his belief that A.I. could replace half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years and push unemployment as high as 10 to 20 percent. “If we look at entry-level consultants, lawyers, financial professionals—a lot of what they do, A.I. models are already quite good at,” he said. “It’s hard to imagine that there won’t be some significant job impact there.” Other A.I. and business leaders have echoed his concerns. Geoffrey Hinton, the “godfather of A.I.,” has argued that “for mundane intellectual labour, A.I. is just going to replace everybody.” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said A.I. already performs “close to half” of the company’s workload. Ford CEO Jim Farley has warned that “A.I. will leave a lot of white-collar people behind,” though he is more optimistic about blue-collar roles. He expects skilled workers in factories to become even more essential, as they provide “critically human support” in the context of automation. Several major studies support this trajectory. An August Goldman Sachs report warned that 6 to 7 percent of U.S. workers could lose jobs to A.I., particularly operational and support staff at large companies. Entry-level workers in tech remain the most affected, but hiring has also slowed in marketing, consulting, graphic design, office administration and call centers as businesses integrate new automation tools. A World Economic Forum study in January found that 41 percent of 1,000 surveyed global employers anticipate significant layoffs due to A.I. adoption. A recent Stanford study found that workers ages 22 to 25 in A.I.-exposed roles, especially in customer service and clerical work, have experienced a 13 percent decline in employment since 2022. In contrast, older workers in the same fields have had an easier time finding jobs. Other research suggests the downturn isn’t driven by A.I. alone. Negative perceptions of Gen Z employees and broader economic uncertainty are also factors. A study from Hult International Business School found that 89 percent of employers avoid hiring new college graduates, and 39 percent would prefer to use A.I. over hiring a Gen Z worker. Even so, companies are not uniformly shrinking their workforces. Some are restructuring instead—cutting traditional roles while adding new A.I.-specific ones. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has said the bank’s overall headcount will continue to grow as it hires workers to support A.I. development, despite reductions in operational positions. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon voiced a similar view at an event in September, saying, “It’s very clear that A.I. is going to change literally every job.” Walmart, he said, will both eliminate and create roles, with the aim of helping employees “make it to the other side.” Ironically, while A.I. tools have increased the speed at which code can be generated, the durability of that code still depends on human expertise. A.I.-written code can be clumsy or brittle, and when complex systems break, engineers must know how to repair and refine them. Experienced engineers will still be needed to oversee A.I. systems, but even those roles could diminish, Amodei warned. “Eventually, all those little islands will get picked off by A.I. systems,” he said on 60 Minutes. “And then, we will eventually reach the point where the A.I.s can do everything that humans can. And I think that will happen in every industry.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience. But advertising revenue helps support our journalism.

Title: HP Joins List of Tech Companies Cutting Jobs and Pointing to AI

Reading time 3 minutes Computer maker HP is joining the growing list of companies that are conveniently announcing company-wide AI initiatives and plans to cut thousands of jobs at the same time. HP shared on Tuesday that it expects to scale artificial intelligence within the company and lay off about 4,000-6,000 employees by the end of 2028. With roughly 56,000 employees, that comes up to a 10% workforce reduction. âLooking forward, we are taking decisive actions to mitigate recent cost headwinds and are investing in AI-enabled initiatives to accelerate product innovation, improve customer satisfaction, and boost productivity,” HP CFO Karen Parkhill said in the press release. Per the Guardian, the cuts will be centered around the product development, internal operations, and customer support teams. It’s safe to say that 2025 has so far been dominated by the question of whether or not AI is leading to mass unemployment. The job market is grim. Companies are cutting back on hiring new employees, while some are laying off hundreds to make investors happy in the next earnings report. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in September that although there is still great uncertainty, he believes that AI is “probably a factor” in the dramatic slowdown in hiring, particularly when it comes to young graduates who are facing a particularly concerning unemployment situation. There have been studies to back this phenomenon up as well. A Stanford study from August found that workers aged 22 to 25 in the most AI-exposed jobs were hit hardest by a decline in employment. Many deem the jobs that are easiest to automate are those that would be done by young graduates. Experts have voiced concerns over the impact this will have on society as a whole, as less early career work would mean that the next generation of the workforce won’t receive crucial training. Even without the studies, companies have been openly and even proudly pointing the finger at AI as the reason why they are laying people off or just not hiring as much. Online learning platform Chegg laid off 45% of its workforce recently, citing “new realities of AI” as a factor. Amazon slashed 14,000 white-collar jobs, first seemingly pointing the finger at the “transformative technology” of AI before claiming days later that the cuts were not financially nor AI-driven. Many executives, like Shopify CEO Tobias LÃ¼tke and Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn, have also been clear about their wish to reduce hiring in favor of automation. PwC global chairman told BBC last week that the company had scrapped plans it made in 2021 to hire 100,000 people by 2026, because “now we have artificial intelligence.” Still, though, some experts dispute that premise. âItâs much harder to implement AI in a firm than people realize,â Robert Seamans, New York University professor of management and organizations, told Gizmodo in August. âFirms donât typically have the in-house talent thatâs needed to train, operate, and oversee whatever AI they implement, and so until you have the personnel in place that have that expertise, itâs going to be really hard to rely heavily on AI.â An MIT report from August can back this up: corporate AI pilots are not as good as they seem at generating actual revenue gains. Seamans believes that at least some of these companies are actually using AI as a scapegoat for layoffs that stem from things like economic uncertainty or tariffs, which are “much harder to blame.” Meanwhile, Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar called the “all-powerful-AI-taking-over-jobs” narrative a Silicon Valley “fundraising shtick,” in a recent conversation with the New York Times. Author Cory Doctorow, on the other hand, thinks that AI is unable to successfully replace many workers but bosses, and specifically tech bosses, “love the story” as a means to terrify workers into working more and complaining less (since, hypothetically, an AI chatbot could do all that work and not have to take breaks). “It gives them a chance to put them in their place,” Doctorow said in a talk last month.

Title: Nvidia says it’s ‘delighted’ with Google’s success, but backhanded compliment says it is ‘the only platform that runs every AI model’ — statement comes soon after Meta announces proposed deal to acquire Google Cloud TPUs

Is Google's TPU a threat to Nvidia's dominance? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia released a statement saying that it’s “delighted by Google’s success,” but said that it continues to supply AI chips to the company. The AI giant made the X post in an apparent response to the news that Meta is in talks with Google to rent its Cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in 2026 and then to purchase them the following year. This news resulted in an increase in stock prices for Alphabet, Google’s parent company, and Meta, but also saw Nvidia take a 3% hit, especially as the market probably saw this as a break on the AI giant’s monopoly on the AI chip market. We’re delighted by Google’s success — they’ve made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google.NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it’s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.NVIDIA offers greater…November 25, 2025 "Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done," the company said on X via its Nvidia Newsroom account. "Nvidia offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions." Google's Cloud TPUs are ASICs — application-specific integrated circuits — designed for AI workloads like training and inference. On the other hand, Nvidia's AI GPUs are general-purpose machines designed for parallel processing that have been repurposed for AI workloads. Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs are indeed superior to almost anything else on the market, especially in terms of versatility. Although they're primarily advertised for AI applications, they can also be used for high-performance computing, data analytics, graphics rendering and visualization, and many more. On the other hand, Google's TPUs are designed for matrix multiplication — the arithmetic operation that primarily runs most modern AI. This means that you cannot easily repurpose these chips for other purposes. However, it also gives them an advantage in AI processing, even sometimes giving them an advantage in AI workloads, especially in terms of efficiency. Meta isn't the first company to consider using Google TPUs for its AI operations. In fact, Anthropic has been using it since 2023, and the company has signed a deal to expand its contracted capacity to 1GW in 2026. But the biggest challenge for Google is the widespread adoption of its TPU chips, especially given Nvidia's huge market share. More than that, its CUDA platform is widely used in the industry, making it harder for developers to switch to Google's alternatives. However, the size of the proposed deal between Meta and Google appears large enough to threaten Nvidia's dominance in the market. While it would still be a drop in the bucket compared to Nvidia's skyrocketing revenues, it would at least show potential clients that there's a viable alternative to Team Green's GPUs. Just this thought is enough to send Nvidia's stock price sliding, and it comes so soon after the company's record highs, leading CEO Jensen Huang to say the market does not appreciate the AI GPU manufacturer.

Title: How Much Nostalgia Can an MMORPG Franchise Sustain?

Nostalgia can be a powerful influence on people. We all seem to have within us to desire to go back to some illusory “simpler time” when everything was better, more fun, less stressful, and didn’t cost so damn much. The problem is that only one of those items is consistently correct. That doesn’t stop businesses from preying on that desire to turn back the clock, though sometimes it is we, the customers, who end up banging on the door begging to be preyed upon. I think my earliest direct experience with this was Coca-Cola Classic. A registered trade mark of the Coca-Cola Corporation of Atlanta, Georgia Coke, having secured domination of the cola market, was now involved in the “cola wars” where Pepsi, pretender to the cola throne, was doing all it could to chip away and Coke’s market share. For some reason, Coke lost their minds and reformulated Coke to be more like Pepsi, thinking this would put Pepsi in it place. And so we got New Coke, which will live forever in business texts as an example of bad ideas. Coke, seeing their market share drop on the move, introduced Coca-Cola Classic. This set off a mild wave of nostalgia, as the company framed it that way, and we all ran to this new version of Coke and, for a brief time, Coke had even more market share with New Coke and Classic running in parallel. Then most people just picked Classic, sales of New Coke tanked, it was removed from the market, and we were back to just on core version of Coke. After that the company mostly ignore Pepsi and Pepsi scaled back their own costly assault on Coke somewhere around Crystal Pepsi and now we just have flavored versions of either as our variation. Not the last time I would see a nostalgia play, nor a nostalgia play that wore itself out as it simply became the new normal. In particular, for this discussion, there are MMORPGs that seem to rely pretty heavily on nostalgia after a certain point in their life cycle. EverQuest springs pretty readily to mind on that front. The game, coming up on its 27th year in a few months, took its first dip into the nostalgia pool 20 years ago, rolling out the first of what would become a long line of servers promising something akin to the first day experience. But it isn’t just the special servers that try to create a vision of the original. The expansions on the main servers… the “live” servers in EQ parlance, which translated to “retail” over in Azeroth… start to go back to old favorite locations in an attempt to capture a bit of that nostalgia magic. This same thing has been going on with World of Warcraft as well. In fact, Blizz was a little late to the party, taking 15 years to get there when titles that launched after WoW had been there already. But when Blizz finally got there, WoW Classic was a rousing success. It might even be considered a critical moment for the franchise as WoW Classic arrived just in time to save the game… financially at least… from the huge fumble that was the Shadowlands expansion on the retail side of the house. I am probably projecting my personal experience when I say Shadowlands broke the connection with retail for some… but the success of WoW Classic in that moment sealed it as a permanent fixture on the WoW agenda. The problem is that nostalgia is somewhat predicated on that past happy/better/ideal time being unavailable or unreachable. The whole point is that it is something in your personal story that you can no longer do. But what happens when that old experience is suddenly readily available again? What if you know that every spring the EQ team is going to roll out some minor variation on a fresh start, special rules, classic server. What happens when every expansion is going back to some old location? Or, on the WoW side of the street, what happens when you don’t understand that progress in old content is extremely accelerated so you let old expansions sit on the classic server long past their freshness date? What happens when your classic team’s monetization goals mean selling conveniences that were never in the original? What happens when you try to solve the “freshness” problem of old content by just cranking the difficulty dial one way or another while dumping modern features on top of the old content? And WHAT THE HELL happens when your retail team just gives up once and for all on being able to create two years of new content and decides that THEY TOO are going to spend the back stretch of every expansion cycle ALSO running old content, undermining the classic team’s efforts? You want Turtle WoW becoming a thing? This is how you get Turtle WoW becoming a thing! You make everything a blend of classic and suddenly it feels like a beige sameness. The spell is broken and people then want something new to try and reach that classic high. “New Classic” is an oxymoron, yes, but people are complicated and can hold conflicting beliefs. Sure, for a while there, I thought maybe Holly Longdale had unlocked the fountain of eternal youth with classic. But when classic content becomes pervasive, it is no longer classic. There can be no nostalgia when the old version is served up to you constantly… or, rather, nostalgia is defeated when things have changed so much… Dan Olson has a whole side riff on how much different it is to play WoW Classic on modern computers in his Why it’s Rude to Suck at WoW video… that you go there thinking you’ll feel the way you did, and it doesn’t happen. Or it no longer happens. For the first year or so of WoW Classic, it felt enough like the old days and Blizz hadn’t gotten concerned and started modernizing the old experience that I could squint my eyes and get a modest hit of “the good old days” from the game. But like all nostalgia, it is a very perishable product. I didn’t go play Anniversary Classic because it was too soon. The first time only worked because it had been so long since that original content had been playable outside of an emulator that is was great and there were crowds of people and we were all just so happy to be there. Until we weren’t. Now our group is off playing something else. We did WoW Classic and it was good, but even the most powerful nostalgia cannot fix what was broken in the first place. So it was an incredible high in vanilla, followed by a low in Outland… which I didn’t really like back in the day and was also the point when Blizz decided they really needed to monetize this classic stuff more… had a rebound in Northrend, and then died in the cataclysm, just like it did the first time around. I guess full points for recreating the original experience, but also I am no longer a subscriber. And EQ has it even worse. They’ve been putting out the special server thing for so long now that it is no longer special. There seems to be no setting of the dials that they have easy access to that will excite their installed base, and keeping them engaged is a critical part of their own business plan, a plan that wasn’t going so well at the last report, to the extent that EG7’s largest shareholder, Eros Capital Partners, has a list of demands including a new board of directors, more stock buybacks to bolster the share price, and maybe even bringing the whole place private again so they can loot the company without the watchful eye of regulators getting involved. What do you do when the nostalgia well runs dry? Yes, this is where we get to Classic Plus and like dreams. The problem is that the EverQuest team simply doesn’t have the bandwidth to work on a new content creation path for the company’s foundational title. And if things continue to decline for EQ, they are likely going to have to make do with an even smaller team. Meanwhile, the World of Warcraft team could almost certainly find the staff to do something along those lines. Season of Discovery proved they could change up at least some of the vanilla experience. But my outsider opinion, having watched them for so many years, is that there is no internal champion capable of driving such a project. They always had the public company problem when Bobby Kotick was running the show, but they now have that in spades with Phil and Satya so obviously willing to slash and burn the second their bonuses might be in jeopardy. This is where Old School RuneScape is the outlier. Jagex has had a horrible time trying to develop another title. It feels like RuneScape is all the magic they had in them. But when they too went to the nostalgia well, they somehow found it within themselves to create a new path forward, different from RuneScape’s, to follow. This again, however, points out the hollow nature of nostalgia as a business plan. People want to “feel” like they did back in the day, but in the attempt they often find that simply going back to a game in their current state of mind will not fulfill that need. In the end, even Old School RuneScape failed the nostalgia test in the end. In going back to that, the players who embraced the old style of play quickly settled in and it became normal. It was Coca-Cola Classic just becoming Coke for that group. To keep them engaged, there had to be more, a hook, something fresh to keep those players happy. Nostalgia is a gimmick. A tease. A hook to grab attention. But Nostalgia alone is not sustainable, in part because we have all moved on from those times. We are different people in a changed world and the context that made something great at one moment leaves it feeling hollow now. For my final example, just to seal the deal on that idea, I am going to fall back to the Atari 2600. As I wrote years back, I wanted that more than anything in the world back in 1977. And I played the hell out of that console once I had it. But it doesn’t interest me today despite whatever investment group that holds the Atari name tries to tempt me with. That is a console that has been beaten to death when it comes to nostalgia. The history of the 2600 these days is 6 years of success, and 22 years of trying to remind me how cool it was back in 1977. There has been no point in time since the mid-90s when I could not have bought a software version or a reworked, cost reduced, hardware copy of the original, to the point that I wonder who is left to even purchase such a thing. Then again, I suppose they wouldn’t keep remaking if nobody was buying them. But they always seem to show up around the holidays, when nostalgia is often at its peak and many adults are internally struggling with the fact that none of it is as much fun as when they were a kid. And then they see a stack of the latest round of 2600 remakes sitting on a pallet at Costco, and they cave to the temptation in their state of weakness. I mean, I know better and it almost works on me every year… almost. Yeah, I love that Dan Olsen video. His comment about going back and betting on the Cubs in 2016 and smashing in high school when you had the chance as a way to relive your past really hits home, because it also highlights just how far away that I am from my own high school experience for 2016 to be about my kids’ high school experience. (If my kids did smash when they got the chance back in high school, I think I’m happy with not knowing.) Still, Dan was right in that you really can’t go home again, and my form of rebellion in Wrath Classic was to simply refuse to get on the treadmill and do all the things I never got to do back in 2009-2010. I suppose in my own way I was deliberately choosing to suck at Warcraft as a big middle finger to the Classic Community. As far as the Atari (and other classic 8-bit systems) goes, I still have a working console in the basement, along with an Intellivision. (I have NO idea if the TI-99 4/A still works, as I haven’t powered it on in 30 years, but it probably does.) The one thing that keeps me from playing them is adapting them to fit a modern television. I’ve done some investigations from time to time, but the solutions commonly found on Amazon don’t exactly thrill me (I don’t trust the companies behind them when I can’t find any information about them online.) I may have to build something myself, or at the very least degauss the RCA CRT television we still have loitering around to get it up and running. LikeLike My strange variant on this is that the older I get, the less interested in revisiting my past I become but the more interested I am in anything that feels genuinely new. It gets harder and harder to find anything in just about any medium to which my immediate, unfiltered reaction isn’t “Oh, that reminds me of…” or even worse “Oh, that’s exactly like…”. I do still get a buzz out of revisiting old things but nowadays even that usually means old things I missed when they were new. New-to-me is the baseline of what makes me excited now. That’s why I’m a lot more interested in the upcoming EQII expansion, even though it will really just be more of the same, than I will be in whatever retro-server they try to drum up fading interest for next summer. At least the expansion will look new, even if it plays exactly the same. I do think Darkpaw is about done with the TLE server trick, though. They’ve made it last way longer than it had any right to so they can hardly complain but it can’t go on forever. EG7/DBG really need to come up with a new idea for the EQ IP soon, even if a whole new game is beyond them at this point. Maybe AI will save them… LikeLike (Re-posting this comment because the first just vanished. Please delete as necessary!)

By the time they began messing with it, the game had shifted, and you were no longer in control of where you could go; the fights were easier, or non existent, and your trips ‘back home’ were stunningly sad. There was no back home. The story line changed, and the challenges that went with discovery the first time were now yawn inducing ‘oh yeah, I remember this” events. This, to me, is where WoW failed. It told the truth. You can’t go home again, because someone else lives there, the neighbors are gone, and that neat tree in the backyard has been replaced with a horse stall. Even when you know (or think you do) what’s around the bend, you’re braced for one event, only to face a different one. No more challenges. LikeLike I would really like a can of Crystal Pepsi for nostalgia’s sake, now that you’ve reminded me. The sensation I had when I tried it for the first (and, I believe only) time was very fascinating. My brain was like “Aaaaaahhhh, it looks like soda, but smells and tastes like Pepsi, what the hell is going on???” Of course, as with almost all kinds of nostalgia, that, too, would probably get old pretty fast. LikeLike I am far from immune to nostalgia, but the surprising thing to me about WoW Classic was how actually good a game it was back then. Rough edges, sure, but mostly quibbles. Nostalgia brought me to the party, the quality kept me there. But one can only play a given game so much before anything gets old. I hope for their sake they aren’t shifting the same diminishing player base around but actually bringing some new blood still. No amount of remixing will help if that isn’t the case. LikeLike I used to get frustrated with revisiting things because nothing ever seemed right or fun until I realized that it was me. I came to the conclusion that nostalgia is just me wanting to be a tourist among my past memories. That trying to live in the past is just going to be a disappointment/disaster. Once I understood that about myself I found I could have fun with nostalgic things. As far as gaming nostalgia goes, while I never played EQ (or EQ 2) in any serious fashion it has been fun to talk to and read people’s reactions about the progression servers. I get a sense that having a steady stream of them works well because there is enough people that like to drop in and experience the way things were for a time. After they get their fill they generally move on and and a new casual group starts up with the next server. With Wow I’m waiting until they feel the need to have a Chromie time version of Classic available for leveling in Retail. They’ve made a few steps towards making things from Classic available again in Retail, but that deep, rich vein of making all of Classic doable with Retail systems is waiting for them to break the glass. LikeLike Nostalgia is brain poison for old people. I have very fond memories of the blizzard of (Jan) 1996, of doing snow angels in the snow in front of the apartment bldg with my new wife. Great memory, full of joy. Good times, right? But I also remember that back then we were pretty poor, recently out of college, with debt and living in the cheapest neighborhood we could find. I have a very unpleasant memory of sitting down one time with $4.75, all we had, and budgeting it out to last three days til payday. Right down to how many subway tokens we needed and what ramen and cans of food we could get at the bodega. The walk to the train was so dicey at night I’d walk my wife there (night shift) and then go home and collapse into bed (day shift for me). In other words, it actually kind of sucked back then. I watched Halloween a few years ago and couldn’t believe how bad it was. It was one of my favorite movies when I was young. The acting, especially the dialogue, is so bad it sounds like a fourth grade play. If it wasn’t for the fame and “nostalgia” it would be unwatchable. I went to one of those arcade-bars a few years ago. So cool, you can play all these games while having access to the bar! And now I’m older, so I can afford to play any game(s) I want! You can guess what happened. You play Space Invaders, Asteroids, etc., a few times, and realize they’re kind of primitive and boring and only good for a day full of fun if current technology presents nothing better and you’re a kid with less options than an adult. The entire array of games held my attention for about 30 minutes and then it was just another bar. Brain poison. LikeLike “The history of the 2600 these days is 6 years of success, and 22 years of trying to remind me how cool it was back in 1977.” Oh, yes. As far as MMO nostalgia goes, you can go back to the old content, but you can’t go back to the you that had no idea what was going on. LikeLike In a real sense it’s like rereading a book, or rewatching an old film or TV show. I can never be the young me discovering Tolkien for the first time. I can still read LotR as the much older me because I find ways of still enjoying it. Like I can play *insert old game* quite merrily, but I approach it very differently now to then. To get value now I have to remember I’m in the back half of my forties. As Tips says, you can’t go back to the old you; but as Pallais says you can (or I can) sometimes frame things that accounts for that and allows one to enjoy the nostalgia. LikeLike That is a distinction I could have made more clear, because the other direction, the “everything old is bad, newer is always better” idea is flawed in its own way. A lifetime in Silicon Valley has proven that. I still play a lot of older games because they were good. WoW Classic was a lot of fun as a game, even absent the nostalgia aspect.

Title: Want $4,000 per Year in Passive Income? Invest Just $2,500 in These Big-Yield Dividend Stocks

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © jittawit21 / Shutterstock.com How can you leverage your savings into a more secure financial future? Dividends can be a key component of your wealth-building plan, and you can start today by investing just $2,500 per asset into five stocks or exchange traded funds (ETFs). When all is said and done, it might even be possible to take a $12,500 total investment ($2,500 times five different stocks/ETFs) and parlay it into $4,000 in annual passive income. The formula for success is to buy a couple of high-yield dividend stocks and then add several ETFs to raise your overall yield even further. In order to get $4,000 in annual dividends/distributions from a $12,500 total investment, you’ll need to achieve an average yield of at least $4,000 divided by $12,500, or 32%. That’s a high yield target, so let’s start off with a pair of ambitious income-generating stock picks. To begin, you could allocate $2,500 into shares of Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corp. (NYSE:CHMI). This firm is a real estate finance company that specializes in U.S.-based residential mortgage assets. Before we look at the dividend yield, we should make sure that Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corp. is income-positive so that the company can afford to pay its dividends. Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corp. appears to check that box, as it reported GAAP net income applicable to common stockholders of around $2 million in 2025’s third quarter. Will CHMI stock help you reach your goal of a 32% average annual yield, though? Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corp. offers a 23.91% forward annual dividend yield, which falls short of 32% but is still quite high. So now, let’s reveal our second individual stock pick for a $2,500 investment. This firm happens to be a leader in an important market sector. Founded in Israel but global in operations, ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (NYSE:ZIM) is a well-established container liner shipping company. Turning to the topic of financials, ZIM Integrated Shipping Services recorded $123 million worth of third-quarter 2025 net income. In other words, ZIM Integrated Shipping Services is income-positive and ought to be able to pay its dividends for a while, at least. Furthermore, ZIM Integrated Shipping Services pays a forward annual divided yield of 21.94%, which is nothing to sneeze at. We’re still below our target average yield of 32%, but now we can catch up with some giant-yield ETFs. When I’m falling behind and want to rapidly ramp up my total returns, I can turn to YieldMax’s high-paying ETFs. The following YieldMax funds utilize options-trading strategies, possibly including writing covered call options and creating synthetic option positions, to generate weekly cash distributions for investors. Kicking off our three-pack of YieldMax funds is the YieldMax AAPL Option Income ETF (NYSEARCA:APLY). This ETF creates weekly income opportunities by deploying options-trading strategies based on the price movements of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. There’s no doubt that Apple is income-positive, so we don’t need to debate that issue. And while the APLY ETF’s share price may be volatile sometimes, the YieldMax AAPL Option Income ETF offers an outstanding 41.76% expected annual distribution rate. Pressing forward, our second ETF selection is the YieldMax BABA Option Income ETF (NYSEARCA:BABO). Although BABO uses similar options-trading strategies to APLY, the YieldMax BABA Option Income ETF focuses on Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock instead of Apple stock. Because Alibaba is a multinational e-commerce leader, the risk level may be mitigated somewhat with the YieldMax BABA Option Income ETF. In any case, the BABO ETF advertises a 51.55% annual distribution rate, so we’re definitely getting closer to achieving our objective of $4,000 in yearly passive income. The last piece of the puzzle will be another weekly-paying fund, the YieldMax JPM Option Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JPMO). This one, as you surely surmised, utilizes options-trading strategies to extract income from the price action of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock. It cannot be denied that JPMorgan Chase is a financially sound business, and this should provide some confidence if you’re investing $2,500 in the JPMO ETF. Plus, impressively, the YieldMax JPM Option Income ETF carries a 47.65% anticipated annual distribution rate. So, what might you get if you invest $2,500 each into CHMI, ZIM, APLY, BABO, and JPMO? We can find the answer simply by adding the yields up and then dividing the sum by five. I won’t keep you in suspense any longer. If the yields of these assets aren’t reduced, then you ought to achieve an average annual dividend/distribution yield of 37.36%. Thus, we have exceeded our 32% yield target and should be able to generate $4,000 per year from a $12,500 total investment. Your role, then, is to conduct your due diligence and consider starting on your journey to massive passive income today.

Investing JPMorgan just reiterated an outperform rating on Amazon, noting that the dip is an opportunity. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. It’s always a good idea to keep track of analysts’ stock upgrades. Often, they’re influenced by (1) company fundamentals, such as financial health, future growth, and even meetings with management; (2) industry and market trends, including specific market conditions and economics; (3) earnings and financial data, including earnings reports that came in better than expected, or competitive analysis of a competitor, and (4) guidance. However, before jumping into a stock just because your favorite analyst upgraded it, do your own due diligence, fundamentally and technically. That being said, here are a few heavy-hitters seeing upgrades. JPMorgan just reiterated an outperform rating on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The firm says the dip is an opportunity, noting that shares re-traced to pre-earnings levels and are now about 10% off November highs. Just yesterday, Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on Amazon, noting that it’s well-positioned for the holidays. Not long ago, analysts at KeyBanc Capital said Amazon should benefit from the AI boom. The analysts say Amazon’s AWS is still growing strong. It also believes that the ramp of gigawatt data center clusters and customers like Anthropic are potential drivers of revenue acceleration into 2026. The analysts have an overweight rating on AMZN with a $300 price target. Heading into earnings next week, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) just saw a price target hike from Goldman Sachs. With a new target of $435, up from $380, the firm expects to see further sustained strength in artificial intelligence. It also expects to see updated 2026 AI revenue guidance above 100% year-over-year. “The analyst sees AI revenue for fiscal year 2026 to come in at $45.4 billion, marking an approximate year-over-year rise of 128%. This could reach $77.3 billion in 2027, rising 70% year over year,” added CNBC. Analysts at Raymond James also resumed their outperform rating on Broadcom. With a price target of $420 a share, the firm “cited Broadcom’s position as a share gainer in the AI sector, providing operators with customized alternatives to general-purpose processors. Raymond James expects continued upward estimate revisions to support its positive rating on the stock,” as noted by Investing.com. Analysts at Piper Sandler upgraded Oscar Health (NYSE: OSCR) to an overweight rating with a price target of $25 from $13. The firm noted that with enhanced premium tax credits (E-APTCs) expiring at the end of the year, OSCR’s market share and margins should expand. “If the E-APTCs are allowed to expire at the end of CY25, OSCR believes Individual ACA Marketplace enrollment could decline (20.0%) to (30.0%) in CY26. This projection implies that the Individual ACA Market sheds ~6.1M lives y/y; with enrollment collapsing from ~24.3M in CY25 to ~18.2M in CY26,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC. “It reflects the confluence of expiring E-APTCs and federal efforts to strengthen program integrity.” Latest Podcast Episode Amazon Strikes Back, And A Surprise $10,000 Portfolio Buy 38 min See us invest in our favorite AI stock ideas for free Nov 9, 2025 Live Nov 4, 2025 Analysts are doubling down on market leaders, with fresh upgrades for Nvidia, AMD, Walmart, Amazon, and Broadcom.

New jobless claims fell to a seven-month low, indicating minimal layoffs despite a struggling labor market. This data suggests the Federal Reserve may hold off on further interest rate cuts next month, as inflation remains elevated. Meanwhile, core capital goods orders and shipments saw a significant jump in September, signaling robust business spending on equipment.

Title: Who’s Kevin Hassett, Trump’s reported crypto-friendly pick for the Fed?
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/kevin-hassett-trump-crypto-pick-fed
Time Published: 2025-11-26T15:37:30Z
Full Content:
Kevin Hassett, a White House economic adviser, has reportedly emerged as a leader among the Trump administration’s short list to replace Jerome Powell. US President Donald Trump is slated to choose a new Federal Reserve chair by Christmas, and the frontrunner, Kevin Hassett, could be a boon for the crypto industry. Hassett is a White House economic adviser who has reportedly emerged as a strong candidate for the Fed chair position. He is the director of the National Economic Council and oversaw the digital asset working group directed by the White House earlier this year. Trump has been trying to increase his administration’s control over the Federal Reserve, the country’s central bank, thereby expanding the White House’s influence over monetary policy. The nomination process has not yet begun, but observers are already speculating about what a Hassett chairmanship could mean for US monetary policy and crypto. Hassett was an assistant professor of economics at the Columbia Business School in the 1990s. While there, he also served as an economist in the Division of Research and Statistics at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. He was also a policy consultant with the Department of the Treasury under the administrations of former presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Hassett briefly sat on the White House Council of Economic Advisors during the first Trump administration. During the president’s second term, Hassett served as director of the National Economic Council (NEC), a part of the executive branch that the president uses for setting domestic and international economic policy. Despite a lack of clear public statements, Hassett is widely regarded as pro-crypto. In June, he revealed a stake of at least $1 million in Coinbase and that he was compensated at least $50,001 for his role on the exchange’s Academic and Regulatory Advisory Council. The NEC, where he serves as director, oversaw the development of the White House’s digital asset working group, which published a paper earlier this year outlining the administration’s policy on crypto. The Fed doesn’t oversee securities or commodities, so its policy changes can’t affect crypto regulation. But a crypto-friendly Fed could still have a positive impact on the industry in several ways. Related: Bitcoiners perk up as odds of a December Fed rate cut almost double Firstly, lower interest rates generally mean better crypto prices. Juan Leon, a senior investment strategist at Bitwise, said that the implications for markets are “strongly bullish.” He called Hassett an “aggressive ‘dove’ who has publicly criticized current rates for being too high and advocated for deeper, faster cuts.” Zach Pandl, head of research at digital asset investment platform Grayscale, said, “On the margin Hassett should be considered positive for crypto => supports rate cuts, past Coinbase advisor, NEC director during White House crypto policy push.” The Fed also regulates banks, namely bank holding companies, payment system access, reserve requirements and liquidity and risk rules. Tightening or loosening these rules could affect crypto companies’ access to a number of services, including: Crypto custody Lending against crypto collateral Access to payment rails Stablecoin issuer requirements vis-à-vis banking regulations Settlement rules. Still, the White House has yet to make a clear nomination. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced in late October that Hassett was on a short list of five nominees to replace Jerome Powell. These included former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. A nomination is expected by Christmas. Trump has been attempting to assert more control over the Federal Reserve as a means to exert greater influence over his preferred monetary policies. Earlier this year, he attempted to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Her refusal to step down sent the case to the Supreme Court, which, for the time being, has allowed her to stay on. In a court filing, Cook’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, called the attempt a “broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System.” The Council of Foreign Relations has lauded the independence of this system, stating that it “shields the Federal Reserve from undue political influence, such as pressure from the White House to lower interest rates ahead of an election, which could offer short-term political gains but cause long-term economic harm.” An independent Fed also “enhances the Fed’s credibility” and makes the market more confident in its decisions. “Crucially, it also empowers the Federal Reserve to take difficult but necessary actions, even when they are unpopular.” John Authers, a senior editor for markets and Bloomberg Opinion columnist, wrote that choosing Hassett “appears to be about loyalty.” George Pollack, a senior US policy analyst at Signum Global Advisors, reportedly said that Trump will nominate Hassett “because of his confidence that Hassett will be the candidate most likely to support the administration’s priorities.” Were the Fed to become another arm of the administration, the results could be good for crypto markets in the short term but disastrous elsewhere. Lower-than-needed interest rates could score cheap political points but lead to increased inflation. The Center for American Progress explained, “Knowing that the rates will be based on well-researched data, and not political whims, assures the world that the U.S. economy will remain relatively stable and its markets will remain rational.” Magazine: Getting scammed for 100 Bitcoin led Sunny Lu to create VeChain Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, and fintech industries.

Title: Oracle stock plunges 30% as heavy debt and AI uncertainty rattle markets — is ORCL’s deep slide a genuine buy-the-dip opportunity or another warning sign?

Oracle stock has fallen nearly 30% in a month as debt worries and AI-related uncertainty hit sentiment. The company has added tens of billions in new borrowing to fund rapid data-center expansion, lifting credit-default swap costs and widening spreads. Investors are also uneasy about Oracle’s $300 billion OpenAI cloud commitment, as questions grow about revenue timing and concentration risk. Analysts say ORCL looks oversold after breaking below the $200 level. Some see a buy-the-dip setup, but others warn debt, cash-flow pressure, and AI dependency may delay any recovery.

Title: Texas Drops $10 Million On Bitcoin, Officially Buying The Dip First

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Texas has moved public money into Bitcoin exposure, buying $5 million worth of shares in a regulated Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. According to reports, the state’s purchase was made on November 20, 2025, and it used the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to gain price exposure without immediately holding the cryptocurrency itself. The state set aside a total allocation of $10 million for its new Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Lee Bratcher, who leads the Texas Blockchain Council, confirmed the state’s crypto purchase on X. Reports have disclosed that officials chose the ETF route as a temporary measure while the state puts custody plans in place. The IBIT shares give Texas a stake that tracks Bitcoin’s market moves. Based on reports, the entry price equated to roughly $87,000 per BTC at the time of the buy. The buy represents half of the total allocation, leaving $5 million still available for future moves. TEXAS BOUGHT THE DIP! Texas becomes the FIRST state to purchase Bitcoin with a $10M investment on Nov. 20th at an approximately $87k basis! Congratulations to Comptroller @KHancock4TX and the dedicated investments team at Texas Treasury who have been watching this market… pic.twitter.com/wsMqI9HrPD — Lee ₿ratcher (@lee_bratcher) November 25, 2025 The move follows legislation passed earlier in the year. According to public records, the reserve program was created by Senate Bill 21, signed in June 2025. The law authorizes a capped budget for the reserve and sets conditions for what assets qualify. Reports have disclosed that Bitcoin met the criteria laid out in the measure, prompting the initial allocation. According to state officials, the purchase is meant as a hedge and a way to diversify long-term holdings. An RFP process is expected to pick a custodian, with officials planning to transfer from ETF positions to direct custody once systems are ready. The request for proposals is slated for early 2026, based on public statements. Analysts noted the distinction between ETF shares and direct ownership. ETF holdings provide price exposure; they do not give the state direct control over on-chain Bitcoin wallets. That control would come only after the state completes its custody procurement and shifts assets into cold storage or similar solutions. Market observers say the purchase is notable because it marks one of the first instances of a US state formally placing public funds into Bitcoin exposure. The amount is small relative to broader markets, yet symbolic. It may prompt other states to consider similar reserve strategies, especially where lawmakers favor diversification. According to public filings, the state will publish details of the holdings and any custody plan updates. Oversight mechanisms built into the law require regular reporting, and the remaining $5 million allocation must follow the same rules before it is used. That reporting will be watched closely by lawmakers, taxpayers, and market watchers. The buying decision was made amid wide debate over how government bodies should handle crypto assets. Texas plans to move carefully, using regulated products first and then moving toward self-custody when the proper safeguards and vendors are chosen.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Layoffs are piling up, raising worker anxiety. Here are some companies that have cut jobs recently

By WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS, Associated Press Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — It’s a tough time to be looking for a job. Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, sizable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from U.S. President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands. And the record 43-day government shutdown also left many without paychecks. The impasse put key economic data on hold, too. In a delayed report released last week, the Labor Department said U.S. employers added a surprising 119,000 jobs in September. But unemployment rose to 4.4% — and other troubling details emerged, including revisions showing the economy actually lost 4,000 jobs in August. The shutdown also resulted in holes for more recent hiring numbers. The government says it won’t release a full jobs report for October. Here are some of the largest job cuts announced recently: In November, HP said this week it expected to lay off between 4,000 and 6,000 employees. The cuts are part of a wider initiative from the computer maker to streamline operations, which includes adopting AI to increase productivity. The company aims to complete these actions by the end of the 2028 fiscal year. Also in November, Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees. In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and “reorient” the entire company. General Motors will lay off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio in late October, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles. Hundreds of additional employees are reportedly slated for “temporary layoffs” at the start of next year. In long-awaited cuts just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount plans to lay off about 2,000 employees — about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs in late October, according to a source familiar with the matter. In November, Paramount also announced plans to eliminate 1,600 positions as part of divestitures of Televisión Federal in Argentina and Chilevision in Chile. And the company said another 600 employees had chosen voluntary severance packages as part of a coming push to return to the office full-time. Amazon said in October that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. United Parcel Service has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs. UPS also closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year. Target in October said it would eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions, or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. The retailer said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts. In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence, digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. Oil giant ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. Between 2,600 and 3,250 workers were expected to be impacted, with most layoffs set to take place before the end of 2025. Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business. In July, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 “core” workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction. In May, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The company has cited “organizational changes,” but the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Black Friday is here, and there are lots of deals to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated November 28: We have reviewed the best prices and found some of the best price drops we’ve seen, all of which are included below. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout the day. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicks off today, with deals lasting until Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’ll also be checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found over the four days, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Black Friday Tip: While shopping this Black Friday we’ve noticed that on Amazon if you delay your delivery date there are additional 3% savings to be had in the U.S. (2% in the U.K.)! This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart then it can add up to a decent saving. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $200 off it’s a superb saving. We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 have dipped as low as $139 at Walmart. That’s a hard deal to pass up. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 and $100 AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation are simply mind-blowing. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that those deals can sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers should keep an eye on Amazon for price drops on the AirPods Pro 2, which were out of stock (and only showing used models) when we checked, but we’ve seen stock come and go and expect to see again the £169 price for new models we have seen twice in November already. Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’re looking for at least $50 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. Finally, the standard entry-level iPad is the bare-bones option in Apple’s lineup, but it still has a great screen, a capable processor, and great battery life. It’s great for kids and an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $279. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Black Friday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or $74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 / $20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

This undated combination of photos shows clockwise from top left the company logos for Amazon, Target, Lufthansa Group, UPS, ConocoPhillips, Intel, Microsoft, Procter & Gamble and Nestle. (AP Photo, file) NEW YORK (AP) — It’s a tough time to be looking for a job. Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, sizable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from U.S. President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands. And the record 43-day government shutdown also left many without paychecks. The impasse put key economic data on hold, too. In a delayed report released last week, the Labor Department said U.S. employers added a surprising 119,000 jobs in September. But unemployment rose to 4.4% — and other troubling details emerged, including revisions showing the economy actually lost 4,000 jobs in August. The shutdown also resulted in holes for more recent hiring numbers. The government says it won’t release a full jobs report for October. Here are some of the largest job cuts announced recently: In November, HP said this week it expected to lay off between 4,000 and 6,000 employees. The cuts are part of a wider initiative from the computer maker to streamline operations, which includes adopting AI to increase productivity. The company aims to complete these actions by the end of the 2028 fiscal year. Also in November, Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees. In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and “reorient” the entire company. General Motors will lay off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio in late October, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles. Hundreds of additional employees are reportedly slated for “temporary layoffs” at the start of next year. In long-awaited cuts just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount plans to lay off about 2,000 employees — about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs in late October, according to a source familiar with the matter. In November, Paramount also announced plans to eliminate 1,600 positions as part of divestitures of Televisión Federal in Argentina and Chilevision in Chile. And the company said another 600 employees had chosen voluntary severance packages as part of a coming push to return to the office full-time. Amazon said in October that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. United Parcel Service has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs. UPS also closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year. Target in October said it would eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions, or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. The retailer said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts. In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence, digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. Oil giant ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. Between 2,600 and 3,250 workers were expected to be impacted, with most layoffs set to take place before the end of 2025. Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business. In July, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 “core” workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction. In May, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The company has cited “organizational changes,” but the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Nvidia CEO Says You’re “Insane” If You Don’t Use AI to Do Literally Everything

By Frank Landymore Published Nov 26, 2025 9:16 AM EST Don’t use AI to do literally everything? You might want to get your head checked, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. At least, that’s reportedly how Huang feels about any Luddite employees who are still writing code the old-fashioned way. Fortune reports that at an all-hands meeting last week, which took place right after the company reported its “blowout” third quarter results, Huang torched his managers who are still telling their teams to hold back on AI usage — an idea that, to him, should call your psychological wellbeing into question. “My understanding is Nvidia has some managers who are telling their people to use less AI,” Huang said. “Are you insane?” “I want every task that is possible to be automated with artificial intelligence to be automated with artificial intelligence,” he demanded. “I promise you, you will have work to do.” It’s a hard line for Huang to be taking, considering that there’s still no consensus on whether AI tools, especially in coding tasks, actually make workers more productive. In fact, a certain body of evidence points to the contrary: one study found that programmers who used coding assistants like Anthropic’s Claude used less than half of the AI’s suggestions, rendering them 19 percent slower compared to their colleagues who didn’t harness AI’s awesome powers of automation. Nonetheless, tech companies are speedrunning the process of getting high on their own supplies. Google CEO Sundar Pichai claimed that as much as 25 percent of the company’s code is now AI-generated, and in June the company reportedly told staff that they were expected to use its Gemini model to write code going forward. The same story is playing out at Microsoft. CEO Satya Nadella similarly claims that over a quarter of the company’s code is written with AI, and as Fortune notes, echoed Google’s marching orders by telling its programmers this summer that using AI is “no longer optional.” Regardless of the quality of automation, the other big question is what does AI mean for programmers’ jobs? Tech layoffs have been brutal this year, with around 140,000 employees expected to be fired by year’s end. Amazon is in the middle of axing thousands of engineers as one of its top executives, in response to the harrowing reduction in personnel, gloats about how “transformative” AI is and the need to innovate. Huang, however, is telling employee with a straight face that embracing AI will be good for them — even as the leaders of companies that Nvidia is providing its Nvidia chips to, if not propping them up with billions of dollars of its own money, all warn that AI is, in fact, going to wipe out jobs. And so nevermind the widespread reports of AI chatbots literally causing people to be institutionalized — you’re the one who’s out of touch for refusing to fall in love with it.

Despite plenty of headlines about layoffs, American companies are not letting go of many workers. Americans filed 216,000 new applications for unemployment benefits last week, down 6,000 from the prior week and marking the lowest level since mid-April, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. The decline defied economists’ expectations for claims to rise to 225,000 and suggests companies remain reluctant to cut workers despite mounting economic headwinds and a string of high-profile layoff announcements. The number of Americans continuing to collect unemployment benefits edged up to 1.96 million for the week ended Nov. 15, hovering near levels last seen during the pandemic recovery. While initial filings remain relatively low by historical standards, the uptick in continuing claims points to a more challenging environment for job seekers trying to land new positions. The data paint a picture of a labor market in transition: Employers are pulling back sharply on hiring but haven’t yet resorted to widespread workforce reductions. Companies including HP, ConocoPhillips, General Motors, Paramount, Target, UPS, Verizon, and Amazon have announced plans to eliminate positions in recent weeks, though those cuts haven’t shown up meaningfully in unemployment statistics. The weekly claims figures can be volatile around holidays, and on an unadjusted basis, new applications jumped last week ahead of Thanksgiving. The four-week moving average, which smooths out such fluctuations, declined to 223,750. The labor market’s cooling has caught the attention of Federal Reserve officials, who cited employment concerns when cutting interest rates at their past two meetings. But policymakers are split on whether to deliver another rate reduction at their December gathering as they weigh persistent inflation against signs of labor-market softening. That uncertainty is filtering through to American workers. Consumer confidence dropped in November by the most in seven months, driven partly by dimmer views on employment prospects. A separate October survey found that 55 percent of employed Americans worry about losing their jobs, while nearly half believe it would take four months or longer to find comparable work if they were laid off. Continuing claims have trended higher since September, suggesting that while companies aren’t shedding workers en masse, those who do lose jobs are taking longer to find new ones, a shift from the rapid job-switching that characterized the pandemic-era labor market.

Title: Next week could decide whether SEC lets your Apple shares live on-chain — with the same protections

Time Published: 2025-11-26T14:09:40Z

The Investor Advisory Committee will probe how issuance, trading, and settlement could work under existing rules. Here’s the practical path and the roadblocks. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The Dec. 4 meeting of the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee opens with a question the agency has spent years avoiding: “What does it actually look like when publicly traded equities live on a blockchain?” Not as wrapped derivatives on offshore exchanges, not as speculative tokens detached from shareholder rights, but as registered securities trading inside the same regulatory framework that governs Apple shares today. The two-hour panel, titled “Tokenization of Equities: How Issuance, Trading, and Settlement Would Work with Existing Regulation,” assembles market-structure architects from Nasdaq, BlackRock, Coinbase, Citadel Securities, Robinhood, and Galaxy Digital to sketch that path in public for the first time. The timing reflects pressure the SEC can no longer deflect. Nasdaq recently filed a formal proposal to trade tokenized versions of listed stocks alongside traditional shares on the same order book, arguing that blockchain settlement requires no carve-outs from the national market system. Commissioner Hester Peirce made clear in July that tokenization “does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset.” Additionally, tokenized securities remain securities and are subject to the full federal regime. What Dec. 4 tests is whether that framing can survive contact with implementation details: Who holds the keys? How does the NBBO work when trades settle in seconds instead of two days? Can you short a token the same way you short a share? Nasdaq’s blueprint offers the clearest view of what “inside the system” tokenization looks like. The exchange proposes allowing listed equities to trade in either traditional digital form or as tokens, with both versions sharing the same CUSIP, execution priority, and economic rights. The token lives at the settlement layer. Issuers still register under the Securities Act, exchanges still operate under the Exchange Act, broker-dealers still route orders through consolidated feeds, and the Depository Trust Company (DTC) still guarantees delivery. Blockchain replaces the back-end ledger, not the front-end rulebook. That structure keeps tokenized equities inside Regulation NMS, which means trades still contribute to the national best bid and offer, market makers still face quote obligations, and surveillance still flags wash trades and spoofing. Nasdaq warns that parallel venues outside NMS would fragment liquidity, undermine price discovery, and leave issuers blind to where their stock actually trades. The filing explicitly rejects exemptions: tokenization is a settlement technology, not a new asset class that warrants lighter-touch oversight. On settlement, Nasdaq points to DTC building blockchain infrastructure so token trades can clear on-chain while the exchange’s matching engine and data feeds remain unchanged. If that plumbing arrives on schedule, live trading could start as early as the third quarter of next year. The model assumes that transfer agents maintain tokenized registers the same way they maintain book-entry registers today, with the same custody standards and financial responsibility rules, just with a different database underlying them. The Dec. 4 agenda flags a distinction the crypto press often collapses: natively issued tokenized shares versus wrapper structures. Native tokens mean the issuer itself places equity on-chain or directs its transfer agent to maintain a blockchain register, conveying full voting rights, dividend claims, and liquidation preferences. Wrapper tokens, common on offshore platforms, offer only economic exposure: price goes up, investors profit, but they can’t vote the shares or sue in a derivative action. Nasdaq’s filing uses European venues as a cautionary tale. Tokens tracking Apple and Amazon traded there at prices wildly divergent from the underlying stock, required no issuer consent, and granted holders neither voting rights nor liquidation rights. When those tokens crashed, buyers discovered they owned synthetic derivatives, not shares. The exchange argues that letting such products proliferate without registration would gut investor protections and create a shadow equity market that regulators can’t see. The panel will probe how ownership rights flow through tokenized structures, not because the SEC is confused about what a share is, but because wrapping introduces intermediaries who may or may not pass through governance and economic rights. If a token only tracks price, it can start to resemble a security-based swap, triggering different disclosure and margining rules. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) commentary explicitly stated that investors must retain the same legal and beneficial ownership in tokenized form, or the product morphs into something entirely different. The Dec. 4 agenda spans a spectrum of regulatory friction. At the low-friction end are issuers registering tokenized shares, listing them on national securities exchanges, and trading them interchangeably with traditional digital shares, as Nasdaq proposes. Existing statutes already permit that if tokenization is treated as a settlement method rather than a product innovation. Blockchain as record-keeping technology also fits, provided registered clearing agencies and transfer agents meet current custody and books-and-records standards. Earlier SEC staff statements on digital asset custody frame this as compliance engineering, not boundary-pushing. At the high-friction end, there is actual 24/7 trading of listed equities, which collides with Reg NMS assumptions about market hours and consolidated data. Regulators float 24/7 markets in the crypto context, but applying that to tokenized Apple shares means rewriting how best execution works when New York sleeps and Tokyo trades. Models where tokenized equities trade only on non-NMS blockchain venues, unregistered as exchanges or alternative trading systems, also clash with existing rules. Nasdaq and SIFMA both argue that allowing equity volume to migrate to unconnected platforms would shred the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) and leave retail investors with stale quotes. Senate work on the Responsible Financial Innovation Act points in the opposite direction, explicitly classifying tokenized stocks and bonds as securities and cementing SEC oversight. That suggests any attempt to treat tokenized shares as outside the agency’s remit will hit legislative headwinds, not tailwinds. The Investor Advisory Committee can submit findings and recommendations, but it does not write rules. The panel is a stress test to see if Coinbase, Citadel Securities, and Nasdaq can agree on what compliant tokenization looks like when they’re forced to reconcile custody models, interoperability standards, and short-selling mechanics in the same room. If they can, the SEC gains a reference architecture for evaluating filings like Nasdaq’s. If they can’t, the agency learns where the technical or incentive mismatches sit before approving anything. What the panel won’t do is approve Nasdaq’s proposal, rewrite the definition of a security, or bless offshore stock tokens that skip issuer consent. It also won’t resolve whether 24/7 trading or cross-chain interoperability requires new exemptive relief, as those questions depend on engineering details the advisory body isn’t equipped to answer. At most, Dec. 4 yields a menu of options the Commission can reference when deciding whether tokenized equities belong in the national market system or require a parallel structure that current law doesn’t yet contemplate. The meeting matters because it forces the question into the open. The answer still depends on whether the market wants to retrofit blockchain into existing rails or build new ones, and the SEC has to authorize it from scratch.

Title: Weekly unemployment filings drop in a sign that layoffs continue to stay low

We need 1,500 new monthly donors this Giving Tuesday. Every new monthly gift will be matched 3X until midnight, December 2. Christopher Rugaber, Associated Press Christopher Rugaber, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits declined last week in a sign that overall layoffs remain low, even as several high-profile companies have announced job cuts. U.S. applications for unemployment benefits in the week ending Nov. 22 dropped 6,000 from the previous week to 216,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. The figure is below the 230,000 forecast by economists, according to a survey by data provider FactSet.

Stock futures are ticking higher as the market looks to extend its winning streak to three straight days; markets will be closed tomorrow for the Thanksgiving holiday and will have an abbreviated trading session on Friday; Nvidia has responded to reports that Google's AI chips are being considered by other tech giants; HP plans to reduce the size of its workforce; and Urban Outfitters shares are soaring after the retailer reported solid earnings and made encouraging comments about its outlook for the holiday season. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a slightly higher open for major indexes this morning after two consecutive days of solid gains. Stocks have rallied this week—after falling sharply last week amid concerns about the AI trade—as investors have grown more optimistic that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates at its next policy meeting in two weeks. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.1% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq added 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. Gold futures were up 0.7% at $4,170 an ounce, gaining ground for the fourth straight day, while crude oil futures fell slightly to around $58 per barrel. Bitcoin was trading at $86,500 recently, down from an overnight high of just above $88,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, was at 4.02%, up from 4.00% at yesterday's close. Traders will be able to take a breather this week after the recent stretch of volatile trading. U.S. stock and bond markets will be closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday, and will have shortened trading schedules on Friday, closing at 1 p.m. and 2 p.m., respectively. After that, the next market holidays come towards the end of the year with the same shortened trading hours as Black Friday on Dec. 24, and no activity on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Nvidia (NVDA) stock sank Tuesday and is down slightly in premarket trading Wednesday after a report suggested that its chipmaking dominance in the AI sector could be in question. A report from tech news outlet The Information said that Meta Platforms (META) is considering using AI chips made by Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, which is a market that Nvidia has dominated for the last several years. Nvidia responded to the report Tuesday, saying on social media that the company is "delighted by Google’s success — they’ve made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google." However, Nvidia said its products are still "a generation ahead of the industry" and are more flexible and powerful than Google's chips. Shares of HP (HPQ) are down this morning after the computer and printer maker released its quarterly results and unveiled a major cost-cutting initiative. After Tuesday's closing bell, HP reported revenue and profit that topped Wall Street expectations, but issued disappointing guiance, while announcing a restructuring plan aimed at saving $1 billion over the next three years. HP said it will cut between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs, up to nearly 10% of its workforce. The company said the cost-cutting effort is aimed at driving "customer satisfaction, product innovation, and productivity through artificial intelligence adoption and enablement." HP shares were down more than 2% in recent premarket trading. Urban Outfitters (URBN) shares are soaring Wednesday after the clothing retailer topped estimates in its latest earnings report. Sales came in at $1.53 billion while earnings per share were $1.28, each above the analyst consensus. In its earnings call after the bell Tuesday, CEO Richard Hayne said that November sales have been "robust," noting that the company has noticed a "slight shift in consumers' behavior," according to a transcript from AlphaSense. "We believe customers were waiting a bit longer this year to make their purchases until seasonal promotions began," Hayne said, "And we successfully met this shift with strong results in our early holiday events." Urban Outfitters shares were up 15% in premarket trading after jumping 10% Tuesday.

Title: NYC comptroller urges city pensions to drop BlackRock, other managers over climate concerns

Time Published: 2025-11-26T13:08:00Z
Full Content:
Let ESG Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. New York City outgoing Comptroller Brad Lander recommended the city’s pension plans drop BlackRock, Fidelity and PanAgora as asset managers. Lander, whose term as comptroller ends at the end of the calendar year, said all 49 of the asset managers for the city’s pension plans submitted their decarbonization plans to measure their alignment with the city’s Net Zero Implementation Plan. However, following an evaluation of those plans, BlackRock, Fidelity and PanAgora’s plans did not meet climate expectations, Lander said. BlackRock is the pension system’s largest asset manager and currently manages $42.3 billion for all three pension plans, according to Lander’s letter to trustees. Fidelity manages $384 million for the TRS plan, and PanAgora manages $358 million for the TRS and NYCERS plans, according to the letter to the plans’ trustees. Lander said in the Nov. 26 release that the three asset managers “fail to address climate risk with the seriousness [the pension plans] expect.” “The systemic risk of the climate crisis threatens the long-term value of New York City’s pension funds,” Lander said. “Our Net Zero plan is a core part of our fiduciary duty to protect these assets. I am pleased to report that 46 of our 49 public markets managers are aligned with our expectations for decarbonization; unfortunately, three are not.” The NYC comptroller said he has “significant concerns regarding BlackRock’s restrictive approach” to engaging with public companies it owns more than 5% of the equities. The asset manager said it will not proactively reach out to on proxy voting issues to align with a “conservative interpretation” of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s updated engagement guidelines. BlackRock also recently began allowing clients it doesn’t vote proxies for to opt into its Climate and Decarbonization Stewardship strategy, which Lander recommended the trustees’ formally vote to approve for the system’s non-U.S. equity index funds that BlackRock manages. For the public equity index funds BlackRock manages for the system, Lander recommended issuing a search notice to find “appropriate managers for BlackRock’s U.S. public equity index mandates to address the Systems’ climate expectations consistent with fiduciary duties.” “While BlackRock has a global [Climate and Decarbonization Stewardship] focus list of 900 companies, it says it will not proactively reach out to U.S. companies nor set agendas for engagement; consequently, it cannot meet the Systems’ expectations set forth in the Plans,” Lander told the system’s trustees. “BlackRock also says it cannot seek to influence these companies’ actions, which means it cannot meet the Systems’ expectations set forth in the Plans with respect to their U.S. portfolios.” In a follow-up statement issued Wednesday, BlackRock said it had responded to a direct request from the New York City Bureau of Asset Management — which oversees the investments for the city's five public pension funds — and met with its investment team earlier in the month to provide an update on its Climate and Decarbonization Stewardship program. The asset manager said it informed NYC BAM that a version of the program was now available to all five pension plans. “Today, you recommended that three pension plans take certain actions after your departure, including terminating BlackRock’s index equity mandate. In doing so, you accused BlackRock of abdicating its financial duty and putting New York City’s pensions at risk,” BlackRock said in the Nov. 26 statement addressing Lander. “These statements are another instance of the politicization of public pension funds, which undermines the retirement security of hardworking New Yorkers.” Lander also suggested terminating the mandates for Fidelity and PanAgora, which both actively manage U.S. small cap equity mandates for the system. In their place, Lander said the system should seek recommendations for how to re-allocate those assets, according to the letter to trustees. Lander recommended moving on from Fidelity, as the asset manager has “taken a restrictive approach to engaging companies outside of the U.S.,” and is voluntarily applying the SEC’s engagement guidance to both U.S. and non-U.S. companies. The comptroller said other asset managers of non-U.S. strategies have not taken the same approach, which “precludes Fidelity from meeting the Systems’ expectations and prudently addressing climate risk and opportunity in their engagement of companies.” Lander said PanAgora does not engage companies beyond the topic of emissions disclosures. As such, “they do not engage companies to take any decarbonization actions to improve carbon efficiency such as setting emissions reduction targets or adopting decarbonization plans even when such actions may be beneficial to a company.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Upcoming leadership changes in the White House and Congress are expected to create a more adversarial stance on ESG and climate issues in 2025.

Title: Disney Wants to ‘Break Spell’ of Guests Glued to Phones in Parks
URL: https://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-world-guests-glued-phones-screen-time-complaints-solution/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T13:05:34Z

Walt Disney World fans have a lot of complaints and criticism for the company, and in a rare turn of events, the head of Imagineering agrees with them about one of the biggest problem points with the guest experience in the parks. Unfortunately, one of his proposed solutions isn’t going to be well received, but the first step is acknowledging there’s an issue. Frankly, we’re thankful to hear this. As we’ve covered in Top 10 Guest Complaints About Walt Disney World and other roundups of the biggest annual fan concerns about WDW, we’ve been receiving negative reader feedback at a far historically-high rate over the last 5 years. Essentially, since the honeymoon phase of the post-COVID reopening wore off and fans started realizing temporary changes were going to become permanent. The #4 entry on last year’s version of the biggest complaints list was “too much screen time.” Refreshing for better Lightning Lanes. Mobile Order for counter service restaurants and Merchandise Mobile Checkout to buy stuff. Checking Walk-up Waitlist for new table service availability. Looking at wait times and showtimes. And so on and so forth. It’s been our position that this is both an obvious issue and an overblown one. So many entries on the above list are entirely optional. You can opt-out of Lightning Lanes completely, there are cash registers for counter service restaurants and merchandise, ADRs can be made pre-trip, and wait times boards are throughout the park (if you even need them in the first place). On the other hand, optional might need air quotes around it. Ignore all of those app features to your own detriment, as they can help simplify and streamline your day. Not only that, but FOMO makes it difficult to opt-out of Lightning Lanes or anything else. The compulsion to check the My Disney Experience app is a direct result of the deliberate choices that Walt Disney World has made. For years, we’ve said that Walt Disney World leans too heavily on technology (ironic, since Disney is objectively awful at it) and not enough on tactile experiences. To paraphrase my favorite Walt Disney quote, “it’s people that make the dream a reality.” The best memories are formed as a result of interpersonal moments, and so much emotional resonance is derived from guests connecting with others. Even if people can’t put their finger on it, so much of what differentiates and defines the appeal of Walt Disney World is the ‘little things’ that bring them together with each other and shared spaces. Big new rides get people to take the trip, but it’s the myriad little things and those connections that convince them to return. Then, of course, there are the themed environments that Imagineering worked so hard to create. By having their faces buried in their phones while in line or strolling through the park, guests are missing so much of the defining features of Walt Disney World. It’s not just about racing from ride to ride and accomplishing those, checklist-style, with the shortest wait times possible. It’s the spaces in between–the breathing room and richly themed environments–that make Disney, Disney. If guests are overlooking that, they’re missing a lot of what separates Walt Disney World from regional parks. Walt Disney World now nudges guests towards spending way too much time with their faces buried in their phones. These new app features are great in isolation, and benefit the company by improving efficiency and cutting costs. However, the totality of all of this amounts to Walt Disney World effectively leaning into its biggest weaknesses (technology and isolation) and away from its strengths (richly themed environments and togetherness). It might look good in the quarterly financials, but all of this technology does come with a long-term cost. And now, it would seem that someone high-up in the company actually agrees with the spirit of this sentiment… Walt Disney Imagineering President Bruce Vaughn commented on exactly this issue, and how phones inhibit the guest experience in the parks. Here’s what he said: Extended reality is gonna reinforce the shared experience. A big differentiator for us is that you’re there together with friends and family and people that you care about, and every time you look have to look down at a device or a phone, it breaks that spell. If you can use extended reality, I never stop looking at the environment I’m in or at the people I’m with, it’s gonna be less disruptive. Asa Kalama, Executive Creative Director at Walt Disney Imagineering, spoke about the possibilities of the new partnership with Disney, Meta and Ray-Ban. We have a really wonderful partnership with Meta to leverage their Ray-Ban smart glasses for both guest-facing applications and also behind the scenes design applications as well. What’s great about these glasses is they’ve got cameras in them, microphones, and speakers. For guests, it allows us to put a virtual theme park guide in their ear. The glasses can enhance the ways we tell stories for our guests, unlocking a world of information about the land that they’re in. Just by looking around, I can ask questions about some of the architectural details, and I get the answer right in my ear. Maybe I wanna learn a little bit more about a merchandise item for my child. All I have to do is look at it, ask, “tell me more information about it.” Then, right in my ear, I get all of the product information. Kalama later added: “if we’re doing our jobs properly, all of the technology goes away and our guests get immersed in the story we’re trying to tell.” Another Imagineer was quick to say that Disney “is not just using technology for technology’s sake.” Instead, Disney is using technology “in service of story” they’re trying to tell. This is great sentiment, and I absolutely agree with it. The only problem is that I’ve been a Disney Adult for two decades now, and I’ve seen countless examples of the technological tail wagging the dog in the parks. Things like the entire NextGen initiative to Made with Magic/Glow with the Show to Genie and more. There are countless examples of abandoned technology that the company invested big bucks into, seemingly failing to take into account whether it was something guests would actually embrace. Vaughn and Kalama were just two of the Imagineers who covered this and adjacent topics as part of the new ‘Inside Imagineering Research & Development’ episode of the “We Call it Imagineering” YouTube series. During that, Disney shared an inside look at its once-secret internal R&D arm, while also highlighting prolific partnerships with tech companies including Nvidia, Google, and Meta. I want to start by saying that I’ve enjoyed every episode of “We Call It Imagineering,” but the ‘Inside Imagineering Research & Development’ episode is the first one that really felt like it was aimed at two distinct audiences. There’s the fans, obviously, and we no doubt ate up this behind-the-scenes look at what Disney is doing with robotics. At the same time, a lot of this seemed to be aimed squarely at investors, as a part of Disney’s years-long quest to be viewed (and valued) as a technology company. Heck, they even got Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to say, “at the core, Disney is a technology company.” Wall Street’s favorite CEO said the thing! That’s gotta be worth at least a 2% boost to Disney’s share price!!! In all seriousness, I can’t imagine there are many (any?) diehard Disney fans who were on the edges of their seats waiting to hear Jensen Huang’s take on Imagineering. If you gave me 10,000 guesses as to who would be featured in this episode, I wouldn’t have picked him. And yet, from Disney’s perspective–since it’s serving multiple audiences with content like this–that was probably the most consequential portion of the episode. (One of my favorite writers, Matt Levine of Bloomberg, routinely writes about the circularity of AI deals. Those sometimes involve partnerships with Nvidia and the promise to purchase their chips. That’s not the nature of the Disney-Nvidia relationship, but it’s close enough that this video reminded me of it. Point being, AI is definitely not a bubble. Nothing to see here, folks, just some totally normal pumping of stock prices.) The Meta x Ray-Ban smart glasses feel similarly. That this has been deemed a marquee corporate alliance for the Walt Disney Company (because Meta is a big deal), so they’re supposed to throw resources at it and tout it whenever possible. Honestly, I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised if Meta is underwriting all of the research & development that Disney is doing, and whatever the consumer product ends up being. There’s a tremendous amount of value to Meta in having trusted brands lend their goodwill to this product and normalize it, as Meta isn’t exactly a beloved American institution and this product isn’t something anyone asked for. So it’s going to take time and effort to reach a critical mass. If this is sounding familiar already, it’s because there’s overlap between the Meta x Ray-Ban smart glasses and Apple Vision Pro, which we discussed a couple of years ago when Disney announced a creative partnership for that product. I expressed skepticism at the time, just as I had done previously with Disney’s forays into the metaverse, Cinderella Castle Mural of Memories NFT, Prime-Style Membership Program, AI Task Force, and so on and so forth. What I wrote about Apple Vision Pro more or less applies to the Meta x Ray-Ban smart glasses. And I’ll be honest, I am openly hoping for both to fail so spectacularly that tech companies don’t try this nonsense again for another decade or two. For all of its promise and potential to bring us together, technology has done as much or more to isolate us. We walk around all day with our faces buried in screens; rather than chatting with strangers in face-to-face settings, we pick up our phones the moment there’s a brief lull in conversation. Our fixation with the virtual world has stressed the social fabric, and we are collectively worse for it–even as some aspects of our lives have unquestionably improved thanks to technology. Smart glasses obviously are less obtrusive than clunky Apple Vision Pro headsets. They nevertheless will isolate people from one another in public spaces if widely adopted and used in day-to-day life. If products like this become socially acceptable to wear and interact with in public, we will lose more of the small but meaningful interactions that make us human. That might sound hyperbolic, but the concerns are well-founded. This is precisely what the documentary “Her” was talking about. Disney and Meta can pretend that the future is a world where we’re freed from our screens and talking to an AI copilot as we interact with our family and friends, all while quickly learning about the world around us. Maybe they’re right! Perhaps that’s how it’ll happen. In my view, the more likely outcome is that this isolates people even further. That instead of talking to one another, striking up a conversation with fellow guests or asking questions of Cast Members, everyone retreats to their AI assistants to interact with. That we become less social with actual humans, siloing ourselves off because our agreeable AI companions are easier to talk to. Again, this might sound like doom and gloom. But does anyone actually think that social media made us more sociable? Or that any emerging technology in the last couple of decades has made us less, not more, addicted to devices? Do you truly believe that Meta wants you to spend less time using its products and more time immersed in reality? These trend lines are only going in one direction–at least, if the companies behind them have their ways. They can say otherwise, but they don’t exactly have strong track records with the truth. However, that comes with a very big “if.” Smart glasses are more likely to become socially acceptable to wear in public spaces than Apple Vision Pro (at least with its currently form factor). There’s no doubt about that. But that’s only because most people don’t realize you’re wearing them. I would imagine that it’d be a different story entirely if you got into a crowded queue and started asking questions to your sunglasses. As other guests start looking at you like you’re a crazy person, go ahead and try explaining that you’re talking to your “smart” sunglasses. See how well that goes over. Obviously, I don’t speak for the park-going public, but if I had such an interaction, I would move away from the person in question. Mostly because I don’t want to be in their field of view being watched over by Mark Zuckerberg. But partly because I have certain preconceived notions about someone who would carry on a conversation with their sunglasses. Maybe I’m alone in this, but I doubt it. If you already have these sunglasses and love them, more power to you. Perhaps you’re seeing the world in a new way; it’s worth acknowledging that the reverse might also be true. A decade ago, Google Glass learned precisely that lesson–that this kind of wearable was simply a bridge too far for average Americans. Google Glass was a spectacular failure, and the people who wore that nascent version of this tech were viewed as creeps and weirdos. But Meta and Ray-Ban are more mainstream, and perhaps partners like Disney will further normalize this type of wearable. Or maybe tech evangelists in Silicon Valley are truly disconnected from the rest of human civilization, unable to see beyond their own bubbles where products like this capture the imagination and are deemed the future of humanity. The majority of average Americans are weirded out by this type of thing, do not view it as the logical evolution of the smart device, and will never adopt it. While I don’t think there’s any putting the genie back in the bottle when it comes to the ubiquitousness of technology in society–nor should there be, as there are tangible benefits–I do think that people are becoming, and will continue to become, more cognizant of the dangers of living online and benefits of disconnecting. This is already happening. The first generation of kids exposed to social media and phones at young ages are now parents ourselves, and we’ve seen this firsthand. Phone-free schools are already increasingly common, but there’s a growing push to make schools screen-free entirely. And at least in our circle, most parents significantly limit screen time, or don’t allow it at all. This may seem beside the point, or to reinforce the desire for something like smart glasses, but it’s really not. The underlying sentiment is a skepticism about these tech companies and the addictiveness of their products. If you have any doubt about this, consider researching how tech executives restrict their own children’s use of these devices–or common policies around Silicon Valley school districts. It’s not just Millennial parents, the same trends are happening among younger people. Gen Z is more technologically literate than older generations, and they have a clearer view of these products and companies like Meta. And there’s certainly no reason to believe that older generations will be the early adopters of things like smart glasses, giving them the necessary market penetration. So who, exactly, is this for? What’s the path to it becoming as popular as the iPod or iPhone? It’s my fairly strong belief that there isn’t one. That the Meta x Ray-Ban smart glasses will be the best-selling version of this product, but that it won’t have even 1% of the market penetration as the smart phone. And from that perspective alone, this is DOA as being the future of the theme park experience. This cannot be what ‘breaks the spell’ (I realize I’m using this differently than Vaughn, but I found his turn of phrase apt–albeit in a different direction) of guests being glued to their phones, as not enough guests will use it for it to make a meaningful difference. It’s like the notion that Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser, Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge Datapad, Play Disney Parks, or any other past efforts at creating virtual worlds within the physical confines of Walt Disney World were the future of theme parks. An impossibility based on scale alone. Even with more charitable assumptions than I’m willing to make, it’s highly unlikely that there will ever be enough uptake for something like this to be what resolves the problem of excessive screen time. Perhaps Disney has been paid enough ZuckBucks and such a Walt Disney World application for the Meta x Ray-Ban smart glasses will come to fruition, but it’ll only work for fewer than 5% of guests. And probably the ones least inclined to be on their phones less. Ultimately, I’m heartened that Imagineering President Bruce Vaughn recognizes that excessive screen time is a problem with the guest experience, and something that actively undercuts what his division creates. At the same time, I’m also unconvinced that he has any realistic solutions to address this, or that the powers that be view this as a bug as opposed to a feature. Given that, the most likely outcome is more technology as opposed to less, and the hope that some of that will somehow be a net positive for the parks…and humanity. I don’t like our odds.

And now they think people will want to use different glasses? Outside? Really? I suppose this could become an alternative to 3D glasses on Flight of Passage or Toy Story Mania…but that’s about it. Mom tells me to turn the phone on whenever I go out running errands or to a local restaurant (so she can contact me), but I always keep it off when I go to the theme parks. I boycott Lightning Lane because I think it’s an example of Disney greed & they should’ve stuck with free FastPasses. I’m not very technologically adept anyway & can’t even get my phone’s screen to cooperate with me to successfully type in a password when it keeps randomly switching between the letter, number, & symbol keyboards. Maybe if I could actually use a SmartPhone for more than calling home if I’m going to be late, I would be on the phone more often at the parks. But I’m glad I still enjoy being in the minute when I’m there. I rarely carried an old-fashioned camera with me for the same reasons. Labeling “Her” a documentary is the kind of thing that keeps me coming back, Tom. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Vanguard Climbs the Bond Ladder With Latest Launch
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/investing-strategies-etf/vanguard-climbs-the-bond-ladder-with-latest-launch/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T11:10:00Z
Full Content:
The bond ladder ETFs come with a target date and can help advisors build income for clients’ major life events. Sean Allocca sean@thedailyupside.com Vanguard’s finally climbing its way up the ladder. The world’s second-largest issuer filed this week to launch 10 corporate bond ladder ETFs, years after products from top competition like BlackRock and Invesco. The new defined-maturity funds package bonds with similar face values and end dates into a single product and give advisors a way to plan for major life events, like paying for college or funding retirement. The Vanguard funds have maturity dates between 2027 and 2036 and will look to undercut the competition on price at just 8 basis points, according to a filing with the SEC. It’s the latest addition in a flurry of new products launched this year under new-ish CEO Salim Ramji, and will enter a busy space where competitors have already planted flags, billboards and possibly lawn furniture. “Vanguard pioneered the index fund, but they have rarely been first movers on ETFs,” said Jeff De Maso, editor of the Independent Vanguard Adviser. “Generally, they’ve been late to the game, and ultimately won through lower fees and their reputation.” Bond ladders have advantages over traditional funds because they provide a consistent cash flow over time. They can also give clients the “peace of mind” that comes with seeing them as a holding in their brokerage account, and knowing they’re going to mature at par, even if interest rates rise and bond prices dip, De Maso said. Scott Van Den Berg, CFP, of Century Management said the real joy is lining them up with future cash needs. For example, Van Den Berg built ladders to help clients bridge the gap between retirement and the start of Social Security. “Investors aren’t familiar with how individual bonds trade or how they behave, so the simplicity of a laddered ETF will be appealing,” he said. “They give us the precision, flexibility, and confidence that each rung of the ladder is doing exactly what the client needs it to do.” With Vanguard entering the fray, costs will almost surely come down and help investors avoid the sometimes opaque pricing found in the individual-bond market, said Mike Casey of AE Advisors. Vanguard will face entrenched competition: Step by Step. Bond ladders are also practical ways to manage interest-rate risk and bring structure to the fixed-income side of a portfolio, said Casey. But building them using an individual-bond approach requires a lot of time and attention to maintain spreads and rebalance or reinvest proceeds. That’s why the new wave of ETFs could be game-changing. “The emerging competition, now including Vanguard, should further compress expense ratios and improve liquidity, which ultimately benefits everyone,” Casey said. The ETF issuer is among the first in line for dual share classes, and it plans to use mutual-fund shares to access 401(k) plans. Buffered ETFs are surging in popularity, particularly among retirees, and that bodes well for their future. More than half of RIAs increased the number of strategies in which they invested. ETF investors can feel the magic between A and I. It’s why they say they’re loading up on funds. Investors pulled more than half a billion dollars out of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust in just one day last week. So-called copycat filings are picking up, but whether they’re a problem remains up for debate. This week’s SEC decision may be one of the most significant since the ETF Rule in 2019. Janus Henderson and Reckoner Capital Management both filed to launch new collateralized debt obligations strategies this month. Trading fractional shares for whole shares will require some communication and help, according to one firm that offers shareholder services. More people are planning to buy ETFs, and their biggest demands are exposure to stocks and digital assets, per BlackRock. No state income taxes and pro-business policies have attracted hundreds of companies to the Lone Star State. Some of the biggest companies in the ETF business haven’t been in the game for very long but are quickly gathering assets. © 2025 The Daily Upside

This signals that state-level capital still sees asymmetric upside in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. If you’re a crypto investor, that’s a strongly bullish message. That’s because when public institutions step in during a pullback, they’re effectively saying volatility is a feature, not a deal-breaker. But simply holding $BTC on a centralized ETF rail isn’t where the real innovation is happening. The next leg of the cycle is increasingly about what can be built on top of Bitcoin: scaling, programmability, and yield-generating infrastructure. That’s where projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) become appealing to more aggressive risk-takers looking to ride institutional narratives. Bitcoin Hyper pitches itself as a Bitcoin Layer 2 with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, attempting to blend Bitcoin’s settlement finality with Solana-style performance. If you’re watching Texas buy the ETF dip, the thesis is straightforward: if state treasuries are comfortable with base-layer $BTC, the upside may shift toward infrastructure that unlocks high-speed payments, DeFi, and dApps on top of that base. Texas’s spot Bitcoin ETF allocation strengthens $BTC’s role as a long-term store-of-value rather than just a speculative trade. The catch is that Bitcoin’s base layer still processes 7-10 transactions per second, with confirmation times measured in minutes. Meanwhile, its fees regularly spike into several dollars during congestion. For everyday payments, on-chain DeFi, and gaming, that user experience can’t compete with newer high-throughput chains like Solana that finalize in seconds for fractions of a cent. That gap has triggered a flood of Bitcoin scaling plays: Lightning for peer-to-peer payments, sidechains like Rootstock and Liquid for smart contracts, and emerging rollup-style or L2 concepts to add programmability anchored in Bitcoin-level secure settlement. As more institutional money holds passive $BTC exposure via ETFs, the opportunity space shifts to these L2 projects attempting to make Bitcoin usable, not just investable. Within that landscape, Bitcoin Hyper sits alongside other Bitcoin L2 contenders but takes a more aggressive approach by importing SVM semantics and Solana-style tooling onto a Bitcoin-secured execution layer. Where Bitcoin Hyper tries to stand out is in raw performance. The project positions itself as a Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration, aiming to deliver Solana-fast transaction throughput and low-latency execution while still anchoring finality back to Bitcoin Layer 1. In practice, that means sub-second block times, rapid confirmation, and fees targeted in the sub-cent range for routine transfers. Under the hood, the architecture is modular: Bitcoin L1 handles settlement and periodic state anchoring, while a high-speed SVM-based Layer 2 processes execution in real time. A single sequencer orders transactions and commits them back to Bitcoin, while a decentralized canonical bridge allows $BTC holders to move value onto the L2 as wrapped assets. SPL-compatible token standards are adapted for this environment, giving Rust developers a familiar model to build swaps, lending protocols, and NFT or gaming primitives. From an adoption standpoint, the team is leaning on tokenonomics and early traction to draw capital. The presale has already raised over $28.5M, with tokens at $0.013335, indicating that a growing number of investors is already investing in SVM-on-Bitcoin narratives. Whales are particularly interested in the project. Less than two weeks ago, one purchased a little over $500K worth of $HYPER tokens, which is the strongest signal of support yet on Bitcoin Hyper. Long-term, $HYPER token could explode, and according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, it could reach a high of $0.20 by the end of 2026. That’s about a 1,399% increase from its current price. Bitcoin Hyper’s value proposition is simple: if states like Texas are bullish on Bitcoin, then an L2 that builds upon $BTC’s infrastructure can only soar in popularity. But with a price increase coming up a day from now, it’s best to act quickly and lock in $HYPER at a discounted price. Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today.

Title: PLUME Jumps 55% in One Hour after Upbit Listing News
URL: https://www.coinspeaker.com/plume-jumps-55-in-one-hour-upbit-listing-news/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T07:46:03Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. The PLUME token shot up more than 55% in one hour after leading South Korean exchange Upbit announced its listing. Plume Network’s native token PLUME surged roughly 55% within an hour after South Korean exchange Upbit confirmed that it will list the asset on its KRW market on Nov. 26. Trading volume shot up, with 24-hour volume rising nearly 600% to $187 million. According to CoinMarketCap, at press time, PLUME trades near $0.039 and its market cap has risen 56% to $111 million and it is now among the top 250 cryptocurrencies. In August 2025, the token was chosen for Binance listing following a 150 million-token airdrop. Trading pairs included USDT, USDC, FDUSD, TRY, and Binance’s BNB. The fast rally began shortly after Upbit revealed that PLUME would be listed on its Korean won-denominated market. Over 10 million users of the South Korean exchange will now be able to actively trade the token. PLUME is now live in the KRW market on @Official_Upbit. Korean users can access PLUME directly with Korean Won, expanding our reach across one of the world’s most active retail trading markets. Full announcement: https://t.co/HYb9nG1xxI pic.twitter.com/bOpo4PHZZn — Plume Foundation (@plumefndn) November 26, 2025 To guard against early volatility, Upbit has introduced temporary limits. Buyout orders will be blocked for about five minutes after launch, sell orders priced more than 10% below the previous day’s close will be restricted for the same period, and only limit orders will be allowed for roughly two hours. Upbit has followed a similar standard approach for new listings that attract rapid speculative interest. As reported earlier, in October, Upbit listed INFINIT (IN), which saw a similar increase in price and volume. Plume’s token distribution is split among four groups (20% for core contributors, 21% for early backers, 13% for the treasury, and 46% for community and ecosystem programs). According to the latest schedule, around 32% of the supply, equal to 3.23 billion tokens, is already unlocked, while roughly 68% remains locked. Tokens will be released into the market until early 2028, with gradual increases across all four categories. The community and ecosystem pool will be the largest source of circulating supply over time, followed by early backers and contributor allocations. The unlock plan targets a slow, steady pace rather than large, sudden releases. Plume Network has 279,692 RWA holders, accounting for half of all holders across the broader RWA sector. Last week, Plume disclosed that Securitize, backed by BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, will deploy institutional-grade assets on Plume’s Nest staking system. Nest allows users to trade and earn yield on tokenized assets. Institutional assets meet composable yield.@Securitize, the tokenization leader behind products from @apolloglobal , @hamilton_lane , @vaneck_us, and @BlackRock, is bringing institutional-grade assets to Plume’s @NestCredit staking protocol. pic.twitter.com/g9mQT1WErF — Plume – RWAfi Chain (@plumenetwork) November 20, 2025 The first assets set to arrive will be Hamilton Lane funds, followed by additional issuers in 2026. Meanwhile, the global RWA sector is also getting popular, as by Q3 2025, total tokenized assets reached roughly $30 billion.

Title: This is the first year I can't find a holiday job
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3kqw82j07o
Time Published: 2025-11-26T06:07:43Z
Full Content:
Nicholas Strahl has always been able to find extra work around the holidays. But this year has been the exception. Mr Strahl, 41, works as a part-time retail sales associate at an office supplies store just outside Indianapolis, Indiana. While the pay is "okay", he said it "never hurts to have a little bit more". Finding seasonal holiday employment, for extra cash to pay his bills and buy holiday gifts for friends and family, has been a challenge. He started his search in early October and applied to CVS, Best Buy and a slew of other retailers - to no avail. "I've never seen the job market like this - it's pretty crazy," he said. "It doesn't really leave a lot of power for people who just want to get a job, or have a supplement in income." Seasonal hiring is poised to drop to its lowest level since the aftermath of the 2008 recession, according to the National Retail Federation. The pullback, a sign of caution among US businesses in the face of tariffs and consumer angst, comes as more people are looking for work in the cooling job market. The industry group expects retailers to hire between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers, down from 442,000 last year. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which also predicted the weakest holiday season for retail hiring in more than 15 years, said tariffs, inflation and reliance on automation are dampening demand for seasonal hires. If Mr Strahl can't land a holiday job, he plans to cut down on holiday gifts and hold off on some car repairs. He will wait to replace his old laptop. "At this point," he said, "I'm willing to take anything I can get." Data from Indeed shows that while postings for seasonal work have largely held steady compared to last year, more people are seeking seasonal jobs. And in retail, traditionally one of the biggest hirers for the holidays, there are fewer opportunities. The labour market is "frozen with frostbite", said Allison Shrivastava, an economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab. The fact that seasonal job postings have held steady from last year is reflective of the labour market's paralysis, she said. "You have a much bigger labour pool competing for a smaller number of jobs," she added. The government shutdown, which lasted more than one month before ending on 13 November, had delayed the release of official data on the labour market. But data for September, finally released last week, showed a surprising pick-up in hiring after a lacklustre summer. Employers added 119,000 jobs in September, more than double what many analysts had expected, but the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% to 4.4%. Data from Revelio Labs, a workforce intelligence firm, shows job openings in the retail sector in October were down 22% from last year. The drop signals less demand among retailers for holiday workers. "We're just not seeing the usual pick-up in holiday hiring," said Lisa Simon, Revelio's chief economist. Several leading retailers, including Target and Walmart, have refrained from saying how many additional workers they will bring onto their payrolls for the holidays. Walmart may hire on a store-by-store basis, but extra hours during the holidays will mostly be given to current employees, a company spokesperson said. The lack of specificity marks a divergence from previous years, when the firms have announced their seasonal hiring plans in advance. In contrast, Amazon says it will hire the same number of people in its fulfilment and transportation network as it has over the past two years. "The cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge," Andy Challenger, senior vice president of sales at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. It follows recent high-profile layoffs at big US companies, including in the retail sector. Some smaller retailers are also treading carefully as they head into the holidays, further limiting options for job hunters to find roles at local shops. For Hobby Works, a chain of two toy stores in Maryland, pressure from tariff costs and whiplash on economic policy this year has been compounded in recent weeks by the federal government shutdown. Located just outside Washington, the company, which employs 24 people, pushed back its usual timeline for hiring seasonal workers, president Michael Brey said. Concern about a pullback in spending among government workers, who found themselves without pay for more than a month before the shutdown ended, encouraged the store to cut costs by scaling back hiring, he said. "Hanukkah always happens, Christmas always comes, so we try not to alter our hiring patterns too much," Mr Brey said. "But this is the first year we're moving very slowly." Two years ago, Tanya Secord sailed her way through the application process to land a temporary job at Target, where she worked as a part-time cashier during the 2023 holiday season. This year, her job hunt has been marred by disappointment after disappointment. Ms Secord, 52, sent her resume to retailers including Costco and Target, hoping her experience working in retail would help. But each application was met with either radio silence or a rejection. "It was incredibly stressful because the price of groceries has gone up, the cost of living in general is ridiculous," said Ms Secord, who finally landed a receptionist role in early November. A member of the rotary club, which puts up the lights, said the council's charges had "quadrupled". Delivery companies suggest ways people can stop their gifts being stolen as Christmas approaches.

Title: HP announces up to 6,000 job cuts as Apple trims sales roles in latest tech layoffs
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/hp-announces-6000-layoffs-apple-cuts-sales-roles-10386557/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T04:11:45Z
Full Content:
The tech layoff wave seems to have swept over hundreds of thousands of professionals this week, with big names like Apple and HP announcing major job cuts. HP Inc., on Tuesday, November 25, said that it is likely to cut 4,000 to 6,000 jobs worldwide by 2028. The Palo Alto-based tech giant said that the move is in alignment with its larger plan to streamline operations and embrace AI to ramp up product development, boost productivity, and enhance customer satisfaction. As part of the announcement, HP CEO Enrique Lores said that the company’s staff from teams working on product development, internal operations, and customer support will be impacted. The CEO spoke about the potential impact of layoffs during a media briefing. He added that the company expects to create about $1 billion in gross run rate savings over the next three years. Earlier this year, HP sacked over 2,000 of its workforce as part of its previously announced restructuring plan. Similarly, on Tuesday, it was reported that Apple Inc. eliminated dozens of sales roles to streamline its product offerings for businesses, schools, and government agencies. Reportedly, the latest round of layoffs at Apple impacted account managers and staff responsible for handling Apple’s briefing centres for institutional meetings and product demos. According to a Bloomberg report, the iPhone maker confirmed its reshuffling, asserting that it is making changes to connect more with customers. The company also said that the affected employees can apply for new roles within Apple. Reportedly, Apple notified the affected workers over the past few weeks. The job cuts impacted across the sales organisation, with some teams being hit severely. However, Apple has refrained from divulging the actual number of employees impacted. The latest job cuts come weeks after the tech giant slashed about 20 roles in its teams based in Australia and New Zealand. The latest development comes at a time when Apple’s revenue has been on the rise and it is set to make sales worth $140 billion in the December quarter. In October, it was reported that Apple topped $4 trillion in market value for the first time, making it the third big tech company to hit the milestone. While internally, it has been reported that Apple is viewing these layoffs as part of its vision to streamline its sales teams and reduce the overlapping of roles. However, some reports also suggest that the move is likely an effort to transfer more of its sales to third-party resellers, which Apple terms as ‘channels’. Companies often opt for indirect sellers to reduce internal costs like salaries. It needs to be noted that unlike other tech giants, Apple views layoffs as a ‘last resort’ and is seldom seen announcing massive job cuts compared to Google, Amazon, or Meta. According to layoff.fyi, the month of October saw 21 companies lay off as many as 18,510 employees, with companies like Amazon announcing that it was planning to lay off over 14,000 corporate workers with its burgeoning investments in AI. The e-commerce giant said that it is cutting jobs to make the company leaner and less bureaucratic as it looks at boosting its investments in AI. This would be the biggest corporate job cuts in the history of Amazon. Meanwhile, in November, 20 tech companies have so far laid off 4,545 employees. The biggest layoffs this month were carried out by chip-design software maker Synopsys, which laid off about 2,000 of its employees, constituting nearly 10 per cent of its workforce. A regulatory filing revealed that the company trimmed its workforce in an effort to redirect its investments towards growth opportunities. This year so far 1,114,124 employees have been handed over the pink slip by 237 tech companies. The Law Commission has determined that the simultaneous elections Bills are constitutional and do not need state ratification. They do not impact voting rights or government accountability. The Model Code of Conduct does not need statutory recognition. However, the commission opposes a constructive no-confidence vote and codifying the poll code.

Title: 7 Grocery Store Chains With The Best Steaks, According To Shoppers

Beef prices are going up. Per recent reporting from Fox Business, industry leaders anticipate a top cost of $10 per pound by 2026. Yet, people's craving and appreciation for steak isn't going anywhere. Rather than heading out to a steakhouse (where business is, admittedly, also booming), many consumers are looking to their local grocery stores for steaks to prepare at home. It's easy to walk into a grocery store and find a full list of different cuts of steak, but what's less straightforward is assessing quality while shopping. Truth be told, some grocery stores are better to buy steak from than others. When compiling this guide to steak quality by grocery chains, we identified the in-house steaks brands each grocery chain sources and sells as private label items. Beef or meat brands with larger footprints (take Tyson, for example) didn't factor in very heavily. We also took into consideration whether or not a chain has significant offerings from local or small-scale beef producers as well. Mostly, this guide centers on how shoppers feel about these private label steaks from popular grocery chains. Kicking off our list of best grocery store steak selections is the one and only: Kroger. Synonymous with Midwestern groceries, Kroger is the go-to store for a large portion of the American population. Luckily, it's also home to one of the highest-quality lines of steak from any grocery chain — the Kroger Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic line. Simple Truth, one of the store's private labels, uses beef sourced from Uruguay, which has a more favorable climate for grass-fed and finished cows to graze on year-round. With Simple Truth, the livestock has a diet that is almost exclusively grass. Kroger refrains from using beef where hormones or antibiotics have been administered, resulting in natural meat without sacrificing flavor. In Uruguay, much of the cattle are Aberdeen Angus or Hereford cows. The latter is a hardy breed, while the former is known for superior marbling. You can widely see the difference in the quality of product Kroger sells. Although the reviews on its in-house branded steaks are mixed depending on the store, the Private Selection is reviewed well across the board, reaching at least three and a half stars on each steak (with many rated between four and five stars). The chain offers a variety of different cuts, including choice beef shoulder steak, top round London broil beef steak, beef choice skirt steak, sirloin tip beef, choice tailless beef strip steak, T-bone steak, eye of round beef steak, and cubed beef steak. It may not be the very best steak available in grocery stores, but it's well above most others and is deserving of a try next time you find yourself in one of the many Kroger locations. Trader Joe's, known for its eclectic inventory and cheap pricing, is also home to some of the best-quality steaks you'll find in grocery stores. Although the cuts Trader Joe's has carried have always contained a solid amount of USDA Choice graded slabs, it has updated its selection to be even better. As of 2025, its stock has been updated to include filet mignon, ribeye, and New York strip steaks (all of which are graded as the second-highest grade for meat possible: Choice). The store also offers selections between pure pre-packaged cuts, organic grass-fed angus, and pre-marinated cuts (including, but not limited to, craft beer sirloin, carne asada, balsamic rosemary, and sesame teriyaki). It give the meat selection a versatility no matter what the meal you're making, with options that can fit many styles of cooking. While it may not have quite as high a quality as a store like Costco (which has its own processing and packaging process), for the value and size of steaks that Trader Joe's offers, it's one of the best deals on steak in any grocery store. According to shoppers, the lean tenderness of filet mignon and craft beer sirloin are the best options, as they both have solid five-star reviews. Shoppers in the Reddit group r/traderjoes agree that the store's steak is better than most other grocers. While steak may not be the first thing you think of when hearing of Trader Joe's, it should absolutely be one of the first things you put in your cart on your next visit. Publix grocery store (found primarily in the southeast) makes a comittment to supporting local farmers, and regularly procures meat from regional ranches. Sources are found from beef purveyors like Prestage Farm of North Carolina, and White Oak Pastures in Bluffton, Georgia. Nationally, it receives beef from Verde Farms, a regenerative farming-focused operation, which emphasizes environmental preservation and humane treatment of livestock. The store's meat counters are regularly stocked with a multitude of USDA Choice-graded cuts. The quality comes through in the house brand, GreenWise private label, and the line of meat sold under it. The animals raised for the GreenWise program are fed exclusively vegetarian diets, with no added hormones or antibiotics, resulting in more succulent meats packed with flavor. This, in large part, is due to its local sourcing, as Although the brand sells a variety of meats, including different kinds and variations of chicken, turkey, pork, and lamb, the steak is the clear standout, as its flavor is consistently second-to-none. While the store's website doesn't offer customer reviews for its particular products, the Reddit group r/publix concurs that the steak is of better quality than similar stores, and the store itself largely receives high ratings on Yelp. While Costco is generally known as a place to get bulk items for much cheaper prices, it has some departments that stand out for consistently having quality items (such as whiskies) that some customers go specifically to find. Its meat selection, particularly its steaks, fits perfectly in this category, as customers are always treated to a wide selection of high-quality cuts. USDA Prime (the highest quality beef can achieve) cuts are abundant and are defined by more marbling, tenderness, and flavor than USDA Choice or Select. While Costco sources its veal from Atlantic Veal and Lamb of New York (a source from more than 100 American farms), its beef primarily comes from California farmers in the San Joaquin Valley. It also sources from Iowa Premium and Snake River Farms, the former of which sources from over 1,200 local farmers, and the latter provides quality wagyu beef. Costco does not stock organic beef that's been fed hormones and/or antibiotics, but this isn't the biggest driver of their meat. The store uses a blade tenderizer when working its steaks, which (aside from a more thorough tenderization) severs the muscle and tissue more cleanly than other processes. This creates cleaner and better quality cuts, which leads to better quality steaks (even if they source their beef from similar places as their competitors) that are consistently rated four stars or more by their customers. One of the more common grocery stores in America, Meijer offers a high-quality steak selection to a wide customer base. The chain sources its meats from Certified Angus Beef, Purely Meat, Grass Run Farms, Niman Ranch, Pre Brands, and other regional-based distributors, which has led to consistently well-reviewed cuts by their customers. When visiting the website, almost every cut of steak has a rating of four stars or higher (out of five). Both Certified Angus Beef and Purely Meat are major factors in the higher quality of Meijer's steaks, as the latter helped not only to keep operations moving during COVID-19 (when many other suppliers were shut down), but to raise the overall quality of the meat the store carries. As of today, the store carries some of the most consistently highly rated steaks of any grocer. With there being Meijer locations across the country, you can't go wrong stopping in for some sincerely splendid slabs of steak. Known for its cheap prices compared to its competitors, Aldi doesn't let this keep it from stocking its shelves with quality products. Aldi steak, for example, comes in multiple delicious cuts that can be found for noticeably cheaper than similar cuts at other stores. This isn't because its beef is of worse quality, but that Aldi has carved out a way to obtain and package meat that goes around the issues their competitors face. For example, per Daily Meal rather than sourcing all its meat for stores from one or a small few places, Aldi opts to obtain meat from local farms and distributors. Doing so helps to avoid the costs that go along with shipping, as well as to avoid any added preservatives. The store also stocks private-label products for a large portion of its meat selection, which means it orders meat from a third-party source and sells it under its own name. This helps to reduce costs for things such as marketing, paying an in-house butcher, and (again) shipping and the maintenance associated with it, as well as allowing more specificity when placing orders. Although Aldi's lower meat prices can cause skepticism over the quality of its products, its steak is not to be missed. Despite the store not providing direct customer feedback for individual items on its site, its steak is regularly considered to be high quality by shoppers (despite its lower price tag). Some on Reddit have even called the marbling of Aldi steak "supreme." Sprouts is the banner holder of a more uniquely granola-type of grocery store, and that brings in many shoppers, who choose it religiously. Although all its food is high quality, the steak selection is the best of any grocery store in America. It sources its steak from Grass Run Farms, which provides grass-fed Angus steaks that are more marbled and succulent than your typical grocer's in-house steaks. Sprouts offers a selection of grass-fed, pasture-raised, and pre-prepared/ready-to-cook varieties, while emphasizing fresh, not frozen, meat, and a butcher counter that can assist with any questions or requests that you may have. Sprouts ranked as Tasting Table's top grocery store for meat for a reason, as the care to both source the best meat and provide the best cuts to its customers has resulted in the best overall selection of any grocery store. We've even recommended that Sprouts be your go-to for all meats, not just steak, which lends to the overall quality of the store. Its selections include a variety of cuts for whatever you may be making, including from the chuck/brisket/shank, the ribs/plate, the loin/flank, and the round/top round. While there is a bit more effort required to acquire a cut of steak from Sprouts (due to the higher pricing and lack of store presence outside the Southern states), it's well worth it, as these are some of the best cuts available in grocery stores today and have an overwhelming majority of five-star reviews on most of their in-house steaks. Each selection on this list has to be the store's own brand or label, and not products that can specifically be found in other stores. So while stores may source from the same suppliers, each store has its own processing/packaging processes that contribute to the varying qualities between different stores. They also had to be generally well reviewed by customers, so if a store has one or two cuts of steaks that are highly rated, but most are rated three stars or less, then it would not be included. Conversely, if a store has certain cuts that have been occasionally rated negatively, but that are widely well reviewed by customers, it isn't entirely discounted from being included. As mentioned, each store has its own processes for steak procurement and processing, which will lead to the inevitable missteps from time to time. The stores included in this list were ranked based on where and how they source meats, overall customer reviews, and (when necessary) value provided to the customer compared to competitors.

PHOTO: HP/FACEBOOK Published Nov 26, 2025, 08:45 AM Updated Nov 26, 2025, 07:08 PM San Francisco – Computer and printer-maker HP announced on Nov 25 a sweeping restructuring plan that will eliminate about 10 per cent of its workforce globally, as the company pivots towards arti­ficial intelligence (AI) to boost efficiency. According to its latest earnings report, the tech giant expects to reduce­ its global headcount by between 4,000 and 6,000 employees to focus on adopting AI to increase innovation and customer satisfaction. In response to The Straits Times’ queries on Singapore layoffs, HP Singapore declined to comment. HP’s move reflects a growing trend across the tech sector, where companies are investing heavily in AI development while using the technology to reduce operational costs. Major tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon have announced workforce reductions over the past two years, with many citing the need to reallocate resources, including jobs, towards AI initiatives. Industry analysts say AI automation is particularly affecting roles in customer support, content moderation, data entry and certain computer programming tasks. HP said its AI plan aims to generate approximately US$1 billion (S$1.3 billion) in annual savings by the end of fiscal 2028. The company has been working to transform its business model amid changing demand patterns in the PC and printing markets. HP chief executive Enrique Lores told The Wall Street Journal that the company plans to raise the prices of its computers and work with new suppliers to help offset the higher costs of AI computing. In its latest quarter, HP posted a profit of US$795 million, compared with US$906 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 4.2 per cent to US$14.64 billion, topping analyst estimates with sales in PCs offsetting a decline in printer sales. Since opening its first factory in Singapore in 1970, HP’s presence in the Republic has evolved into a strategic innovation hub, with research and development across print, personal systems and smart manufacturing applications. It was last reported in September 2021 that HP Singapore employed more than 3,000 people. Its current Singapore headcount was not disclosed.

Title: Dell’s stock rises on AI server demand, but HP slides after announcing layoffs and weak guidance
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/25/dells-stock-rises-ai-server-demand-hp-slides-announcing-layoffs-weak-guidance/
Time Published: 2025-11-25T23:51:38Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 18:51 EST / NOVEMBER 25 2025 by Mike Wheatley Shares of the personal computer makers Dell Technologies Inc. and HP Inc. were heading in opposite directions in the after-hours market today after offering contrasting guidance for the next three months. In the case of Dell, which is still led by its namesake founder Michael Dell (pictured) investors looked bullish after the company forecast stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue thanks to what it said is strong demand for artificial intelligence servers. HP, on the other hand, offered a forecast that came in below Wall Street’s estimates and said it’s planning to lay off between 4,000 and 6,000 people over the next two years, accounting for up to 10% of its total workforce. Dell’s results in the quarter just gone weren’t great, as they missed the Street’s targets on revenue. The company reported third-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $2.59 per share, beating the consensus estimate of $2.47. But it could only deliver revenue of $27.01 billion, up 11% from a year ago but shy of the $27.13 billion estimate. All told, Dell delivered $1.54 billion in net income, rising from $1.17 billion in the same quarter last year. For the current quarter, things are looking better, though, as Dell is expecting about $31.5 billion in total sales at the midpoint of its forecast range, well ahead of the Street’s $27.59 billion target. The company is also forecasting healthy earnings of around $3.50 per share, surpassing the $3.21 forecast. AI is the primary reason for Dell’s bullish forecast. The company said it’s raising its overall revenue forecast for AI server shipments to $25 billion, up from an earlier forecast of just $20 billion. It also boosted its full-year revenue target to $111.7 billion, up from $107 billion. Wall Street reacted positively to the report, with Dell’s stock gaining more than 3% in after-hours trading. Dell has in fact become a major bellwether for the AI infrastructure market and its overall health, as it’s one of the top manufacturers of server systems featuring Nvidia Corp.’s powerful graphics processing units. Most of its customers are large enterprises, government agencies and so-called “neocloud” providers such as CoreWeave Inc. It sells fewer servers to the big cloud infrastructure providers such as Amazon Web Services Inc. and Google LLC, also known as “hyperscalers,” which often buy GPUs directly from Nvidia. Still, there’s an enormous market for Dell’s servers, and it said it’s expecting to ship about $9.4 billion worth in the current quarter. But that doesn’t include a recent deal it announced that will see it ship Nvidia GB300-based systems to a neocloud company called Iren Ltd., which subsequently plans to rent their capacity to Microsoft Corp. Dell’s server business is part of its broader Infrastructure Solutions Group, which delivered $14.11 billion in sales during the previous quarter, in-line with the Street’s expectations. Within that segment, server sales and networking parts generated $10.1 billion in sales, up 37% on an annual basis, with $5.6 billion spent on AI servers. The company also sold $4 billion worth of storage systems during the quarter. “AI momentum is accelerating in the second half of the year,” Dell Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in a statement. “Dell is winning in AI because of our unique ability to engineer bespoke high-performance solutions, rapidly deploy large, complex clusters, and provide global support.” Dell’s other main business is, of course, PCs and laptops. They fall in the company’s Client Solutions Group, which reported revenue of $12.48 billion in the quarter, up 3% from a year earlier but trailing the Street’s forecast of $12.65 billion. Clarke said on a conference call with analysts that the company expects PC and laptop sales to get a boost from Microsoft’s decision to end support for Windows 10 last month. Many enterprises have only just started refreshing their portfolios as they scramble to upgrade to Windows 11. “Dell is riding the AI wave with its server business growing by an impressive rate,” said Holger Mueller of Constellation Research. “Servers and networking are now poised to overtake the company’s once-biggest revenue stream, namely PCs. That’s because of AI. The company is on the rise, and investors were pleased to see its profitability grow along with its revenue.” As for HP, the main focus of investors wasn’t its results, but rather its glum forecast and the fact that the company intends to lay off so many thousands of workers. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of 93 cents per share on sales of $14.64 billion, edging past the Street’s targets of 92 cents and $14.48 billion in revenue, respectively. Despite the results, HP’s revenue only gained 4% from a year earlier, while net income rose slightly to $795 million in the quarter, from $763 million one year ago. The PC and printer maker’s snail’s pace revenue growth was a concern, and equally alarming for investors was the forecast for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. HP said it’s looking for earnings of between 73 cents and 81 cents per share, short of the consensus estimate of 79 cents. For the full year, the company sees earnings at between $2.90 and $3.20 per share, trailing the analyst’s target of $3.33. The company didn’t issue any revenue guidance. In a statement, HP said its outlook reflects the additional costs that stem from current U.S. trade-related regulations and “associated mitigations” implemented by the company. HP Chief Executive Enrique Lores (pictured below) tried to put a brave face on what is a very glum picture, saying the results reinforce the power of its portfolio and the strength of the company’s teams. However, investors and analysts were much more interested in hearing about the reasons behind the company’s decision to lay off so many staff. Lores said he expects the headcount reduction to be completed by the end of the company’s fiscal 2028 year – two years from now, so it’s going to be a relatively slow process. It will help the company to realize savings of at least $1 billion in its annualized gross run rate by that time. However, it will incur approximately $650 million in charges, with a $250 million hit expected in fiscal 2026. Lores said the restructuring plan is part of an initiative that will see the company adopt more AI automation to try to accelerate product and software development. It’s planning to automate some customer support services, as well as many of its internal business processes. “We really think this is a unique opportunity we cannot miss to really continue to transform the company and continue to be competitive for the next 10, 20 years,” he told analysts on a call. “I think any work is going to be impacted by AI, and we need to take advantage of it as a company.” The layoffs come at a time when HP is facing significantly higher costs in its PC business, thanks to surging demand for chips in the AI data center industry driving up the price of memory chips. “Memory costs are currently 15% to 18% of the cost of a typical PC, and while an increase was expected, its rate has accelerated in the last few weeks,” Lores said. To counter this, Lores said the company will increase the price of many of its PCs and laptops and work with some lower-cost suppliers on ways to reduce the memory configuration of their products to offset some of these costs. However, the company still expects to see a net headwind of abut 30 cents per share in the current fiscal year, Lores said. “It is a very significant number, and this is net of all the actions that we are already putting in place,” he added. However, the company’s efforts weren’t enough to satisfy investors, and its stock fell more than 6% in extended trading. During the previous quarter, HP’s personal systems unit, which covers laptops and desktop PCs, delivered $10.35 billion in revenue, up 8% and above the analyst forecast of $10.15 billion. Lores said on the call that the company expects to see sales improve following the end of support for Windows 10, explaining that this will prompt a lot of businesses to upgrade and buy new PCs. Currently, only about 60% of HP’s installed base has moved to Windows 11, the CEO pointed out. HP’s other main business is printers, which delivered $4.3 billion in sales during the quarter, down 4% from a year ago and just below the Street’s forecast. The company explained that it’s dealing with a competitive pricing environment that has put off a lot of customers from purchasing new models. Mueller told SiliconANGLE that the biggest problem for HP is that it only has two main business lines — PCs and printers, unlike Dell, which has its fast-growing data center infrastructure business. “The reliance on these two markets means HP is very exposed to supply chain shifts, and it’s currently dealing with much higher memory chip prices,” the analyst said. “However, that’s also true for its rivals and so HP needs to do better. It’ll need to convince customers that its PCs are worth paying a bit more for, or else reduce its cost base somewhere else. Investors will also be interested to see how the company’s automation efforts will make up for the reduction in full-time employees.” As of Tuesday’s market close, HP’s stock is now down 27% in the year to date, while Dell is up 7% over the same timeframe.

Title: Best Black Friday laptop deals: Save hundreds on top HP, Acer, and Apple

If you've been waiting to buy a new laptop, you're in luck. Some of the best Black Friday laptop deals offer discounts on models suitable for every kind of user from nearly every major brand. As one of Insider Reviews' lead computer experts, I keep a close eye on the laptop market to pick out the best savings. And I've already found sales on fantastic Windows, Mac, and Chromebook laptops. There are a lot of savings to browse, but some of my favorites include nearly $100 off the already-affordable Acer Aspire Go, $200 off the powerful 2025 MacBook Pro M5, and 25% off the 13-inch MacBook Air. You have a lot more options in addition to these, ranging from travel-friendly Chromebooks to RGB gaming rigs. Keep an eye on this article for updated Black Friday laptop deals as they come in, and head to our roundup of Black Friday coverage to see all of the top discounts our team finds throughout the event. There are more Windows laptops on the market than any other kind of laptop. This means that you've got a lot of choices, and it's not hard to find great deals. I'm seeing discounts on laptops across the price spectrum, ranging from high-end gaming models to budget beasts. The Acer Inspire Go is a solid option for users on a budget. Its display is decent with reasonably fast performance for a low price. The Acer Swift Go 14 AI is a thin laptop with a bright screen, fast processor, and unbelievably long battery life. Its power and longevity make it great for students and workers who need a laptop they can take on the go. MacBooks were once infamous for their high prices. However, in the modern day, MacBooks aren't actually any more expensive than PC laptops with the same hardware; PC laptop prices have increased, while MacBook prices have remained relatively stable. And on Black Friday, these premium laptops become even more affordable than usual. The newest MacBook Air models feature an M4 chip, which is one of the most powerful ever included in an Apple computer. Its speed, combined with a sleek design and beautiful screen, makes it a top-tier laptop. This larger 15-inch version of the 2025 MacBook Air uses Apple's M4 processor. It is available in 16GB or 24GB memory configurations with up to 512GB of storage. With all the "Mac vs. PC" hubbub, it's easy to forget about the third major player in the laptop market: Chromebooks. They're not as customizable or versatile as other laptops, but they do win in one department: Affordability. If all you need in a laptop is the ability to browse the web, check your email, watch YouTube, and maybe edit some photos, a Chromebook could be a better choice than an expensive Mac or PC — especially on Black Friday, when those affordable prices drop even lower. Chromebooks are solid options for buyers on a budget, and this affordable model from HP has decent specs for casual users. This budget Chromebook offers more memory and storage than most models, along with a bigger keyboard. It's a very affordable option perfect for budget-minded students and workers. Rather than invest in a bulky and pricey traditional gaming PC, a good gaming laptop is a solid option for smooth performance and portability. They're still not necessarily cheap, but finding one on sale for Black Friday can save you hundreds that would be better spent on peripherals like a reliable headset or lightweight mouse. All three operating systems have their pros and cons. But the large majority of buyers should stick with a Windows or Mac laptop. Windows laptops are remarkably versatile, capable of running more programs, playing more games, and opening a wider range of file types than any other operating system. They're also infinitely more customizable on both the hardware and software levels: Dozens of new PC laptops come out every year, and Windows offers loads of internal settings you can use to manage your computing experience. It's the operating system of choice if you want to have the most control over your laptop. MacBooks, meanwhile, place a greater emphasis on ensuring your computing experience is as smooth as possible. There aren't many settings you can edit, you'll install most programs through a streamlined app store, and viruses are nearly non-existent. It doesn't support as many programs as Windows does, but most users won't encounter any issues with this. If you want a laptop that just works without requiring any effort on your part, consider a MacBook. I wouldn't recommend a Chromebook to anyone except the most minimalist of laptop users. Chromebooks are essentially designed for one thing: Letting you surf the web. Sure, they can run some media editing software and support Google Gemini, but other operating systems can do that better. If all you need from your laptop is a basic internet connection, a Chromebook might be the right choice. Different laptop models fluctuate in price over the year. But in general, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the best times to buy laptops. This is because, like cars, laptop manufacturers tend to release new models each year. At the end of the year, retailers aim to clear out their stock to make room for the new models. This often leads to record-low prices. It's mostly branding. There's nothing a "gaming" laptop can't do that an everyday laptop can't, and that's mostly true the other way around, too. "Gaming" tends to be another word for "high-end." Gaming laptops typically feature brighter displays, more powerful graphics cards, and higher RAM capacities than laptops that lack the "gaming" branding. In exchange, though, they're usually more expensive and heavier. In short, a great gaming laptop is also a great everyday laptop. If you want the absolute best laptop money can buy, consider a gaming laptop, even if you've never touched a video game in your life. Shopping for more discounts today?

Several top AI chipmakers lost ground as a potential deal between two Big Tech giants underscored competitive pressures in the market. Meanwhile, shares of an electronics retailer moved higher after a strong quarterly report. Major U.S. equities indexes rose for the third straight session as investors grew increasingly optimistic that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates at its December meeting. The Dow rose 1.4%, the S&P 500 gained 0.9%, and the Nasdaq ended 0.7% higher. See here for more from Investopedia on Tuesday's market moves. Keysight Technologies (KEYS) shares jumped 10% to log Tuesday's top performance in the S&P 500, after the provider of electronic test and measurement solutions topped quarterly earnings estimates. The company's sales outlook came in ahead of expectations, boosted by strong demand from AI data centers. Keysight also announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. Shares of companies exposed to the housing market extended their recent rise amid growing optimism about a cut in interest rates, which would lead to lower mortgage rates. Builders FirstSource (BLDR) stock surged close to 9% Tuesday, adding to solid gains posted by the residential construction materials supplier in the prior session. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) reported better-than-expected same-store sales, revenue, and adjusted profit for the third quarter, and its shares powered over 5% higher. The company also raised its full-year outlook, pointing to consumer resilience as well as gains in the computer, tablet, and gaming categories as customers upgrade and replace older devices. Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped about 4%, falling the most of any S&P 500 stock Tuesday, while Nvidia (NVDA) slipped nearly 3% following a report that Meta Platforms (META) is evaluating using AI chips from Google. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) climbed close to 2% to finish at a fresh high. J.M. Smucker (SJM) stock lost 3.7% after the parent of its namesake fruit spreads, Jif peanut butter, and Folgers coffee released its fiscal second-quarter earnings report. Although sales for the period edged out forecasts and adjusted profit matched expectations, Smucker's full-year profit outlook disappointed. The company has raised its coffee prices as it navigates tariff pressures but said it would refrain from additional price hikes this winter after the U.S. excluded raw coffee from tariffs.

Title: When Is It Going To Happen? The Truth Is That It Is Happening Now…
URL: http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/when-is-it-going-to-happen-the-truth-is-that-it-is-happening-now/
Time Published: 2025-11-25T20:42:28Z
Full Content:
The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Most Americans are exceedingly focused on the present and spend very little time thinking about the future. And if you are in the minority of the population that is thriving in this “K-shaped economy”, you may be wondering what all of the fuss is about. After all, during the holiday season of 2025 wealthy Americans are literally spending money as if there is no tomorrow. But meanwhile, just about everyone else is really struggling. For a long time, we were warned that a cost of living crisis would be coming. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that delinquency rates would rise because consumers were piling up too much debt. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that foreclosure filings would surge when the current housing bubble started to burst. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that cryptocurrency prices would plummet. Now more than a trillion dollars in cryptocurrency wealth has been wiped out. Another thing that we have been relentlessly warned about is the weakness of the labor market. Today, we learned that “the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks”… The U.S. labor market is showing further signs of weakening as the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Tuesday. Private companies lost an average of 13,500 jobs a week over the past four weeks, ADP said as part of a running update it has been providing. That’s an acceleration from the 2,500 jobs a week lost in the last update a week ago. With the government shutdown still impacting data releases, alternative information like ADP’s has been filling in the blanks on the economic picture. This confirms what I have been saying. All over the nation, large companies have been conducting mass layoffs. In fact, Challenger, Gray & Christmas is reporting that the number of announced job cuts last month was 175 percent higher than it was in October 2024… Layoff tracker Challenger, Gray & Christmas recorded 153,074 job cuts in October alone — a staggering 175 percent jump from last year and 183 percent from September. It was the sharpest October spike since 2003, when companies were reeling from the dot-com collapse. We aren’t talking about something that might hypothetically happen someday. This is happening now. In just the last three months, many of the biggest companies in America have been ruthlessly firing highly paid employees… Over the past three months, Amazon, Apple, UPS, Intel, Verizon, AT&T, Walmart, Target, Ford, and GM have all made headlines for slashing white-collar staff — a broad corporate reset that shows little sign of slowing. I keep trying to tell everyone that this is just the beginning. The McKinsey Global Institute is warning that approximately 40 percent of all U.S. workers could potentially be replaced by AI… About 40 percent of American jobs could be replaced by artificial intelligence, according to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute. The American consultancy’s analysis found that robots and AI agents could automate more than half of US work hours, both manual and cognitive, using technology that is available today, if companies redesigned how they did things. Most of the roles at risk involve the kinds of drafting, processing information and routine reasoning that AI agents can do. What would you do if you suddenly lost your job? You might want to start thinking about that. The American people can see where things are headed, and that is clearly reflected in the latest consumer confidence numbers… Consumers soured on the current economy and their prospects for the future, with worries growing over the ability to find a job, according to a Conference Board survey released Tuesday. The board’s Consumer Confidence Index for November slumped to 88.7, a drop of 6.8 points from the prior month for its lowest reading since April. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a reading of 93.2. In addition, the expectations index tumbled 8.6 points to 63.2, while the present situation index slipped to 126.9, a decline of 4.3 points. As economic conditions deteriorate, we are going to see a lot more turmoil in the housing market. One housing analyst named Melody Wright is even projecting that the price crash that we are going to witness is going to be “worse than 2008”… The U.S. housing market is going to face a price correction “worse than 2008,” according to housing analyst Melody Wright, who expects home prices to drop in half as soon as next year. “I think…we’re going to correct all the way to a point where household median income matches the home price, the median home price. And so that is going to be worse than 2008. This could devolve a lot faster than last time,” Wright said during an interview with Adam Taggart, host of Thoughtful Money, published on YouTube. Our system could not handle a crash of that magnitude. But what goes up must come down. It has become very difficult to sell homes at today’s absurdly elevated prices, and as a result large numbers of sellers are simply pulling their listings… Homesellers in the US are yanking listings off the market, as the nation’s real estate sector stagnates. Nearly 85,000 sellers removed their properties in September, the highest number for that month in eight years, according to Redfin. The number of stale listings — those sitting on the market for 60 days or more — jumped to the highest level for any September since 2019. Nobody can argue with any of the facts that I have shared in this article. When people disagree with me, they tend to call me names instead. And that is okay. I fully understand that the reality of what is talking place all around us is not welcome news to a lot of people out there. But if we are not willing to face reality, we will inevitably make bad decisions. And making bad decisions is what got us into this giant mess in the first place.

ByChase Feiger, M.D., Contributor. For two decades, the branded pharma website has been treated as the centerpiece of digital engagement. It has been the polished ‘front door’, where brands prepared to tell their story and hoped clinicians and patients would arrive to listen. Websites still get foot traffic, but they’ve become houses people notice as they pass by, not doors where they open, enter, and spend their precious time. Traffic still flows, but engagement is collapsing. Not because content teams aren’t working hard enough, and not because brand managers aren’t investing. The truth is more fundamental: the world no longer interacts with information in the way that pharma websites expect them to. Healthcare’s literacy problem is well documented. Only 12% of U.S. adults possess proficient health literacy, while nine in ten struggle to understand the health information they encounter, a statistic that has remained stubbornly unchanged across CDC and HHS assessments for many years. Physicians are far from immune: many report that branded HCP portals and even dedicated pharma apps are difficult to navigate and fail to surface clinically relevant information. The content isn’t the issue; the medium is. The pharma website is still built around linear navigation, dense text, and a user journey that presumes time, attention, and a willingness to hunt for answers. Real-world behavior shows the opposite. Behavior Has Changed But Technology Has Not Kept Pace Two major behavioral shifts define the current moment. According to Frank Defesche, senior vice president & general manager of life sciences for Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), "pharma has spent decades pushing compliant, comprehensive content across brand sites and channels, but consumption habits have shifted. LLMs are now major consumers of that content, reshaping relevance and accessibility. Patients and providers no longer tolerate ‘scroll and read’ experience. Instead, they expect direct answers. With the right guardrails, AI can deliver contextual, on-demand information that aligns compliance with how people actually seek knowledge today. Without that shift, the right facts and the right voices will get lost in the noise." For consumers, AI-assisted health queries have moved mainstream. Among U.S. adults who search online for health-questions, roughly 30% say they often or always receive the answer they need from AI-generated responses. For clinicians, nearly two-thirds of physicians report using some form of AI in clinical practice, an 80% year-over-year jump, according to recent AMA data. Both groups have adopted a new expectation: ask and receive, not hunt and click. AI is no longer a novelty layered onto the healthcare system; it is becoming the operating mechanism underpinning it. Clinical AI pathways at Cedars-Sinai have handled tens of thousands of encounters. United Kingdom’s NHS deployed AI tools that dramatically accelerate stroke decision-making for tens of thousands of patients each year. Information seeking has become universally and rapidly conversational and consumerized. Clinicians and patients are consumers, too, and they are passing static websites by as they navigate to more consumer-friendly locations. The Industry Keeps Maintaining Websites While Users Pass Them By Pharma maintains hundreds of sites across brands and markets, often investing millions annually to keep them compliant and current. Yet engagement metrics continue to decline. Despite this shift, pharma continues to justify brand.com investments in part because the sites provide key first-party data, offering brands a window into how clinicians and patients alike engage with their brand content. However, even when a website wanes, the data and insights it once produced need not vanish. Emerging, pharma-built AI engagement layers allow brands to collect compliant, high-fidelity interaction data from within the exact channels where clinicians and patients already spend their time, including email, SMS, social and, yes, even websites. Rather than "driving" users to a single channel in an attempt to understand their behavior, brands can offer higher quality engagement - that in turn yields higher quality data - by meeting the patients and providers that they serve where they already are. The reason is structural. Websites require users to come to them. Even traffic that is ‘driven’ to a website frequently requires a user to leave the channel they started in, be it television, social media, email, and enter an entirely new engagement channel. Personalized, in-flow content repeatedly outperforms generic site content, driving improvements in engagement. But most pharma sites cannot personalize meaningfully without breaking existing infrastructure constraints. That’s why companies like Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) are taking a different path. “Healthcare is personal. Lilly is focused on moving away from static, generic websites to transforming consumer insights into personalized content embedded in their daily 'life flow.’ In collaboration with our tech and data partners, AI is enabling us to upend the old approach and to help meet users where they already are, driving increased engagement and improved patient outcomes,” says Jennifer Oleksiw, global chief customer officer at Eli Lilly. Increasingly, AI is enabling pharma to upend the old approach, and to meet users where they already are. AI Is Rapidly Enabling a New Interface Layer The future of digital engagement will not take place on static websites. It will occur in the realization of a long-imagined omnichannel interface layer, powered by AI, that seamlessly marries scientific accuracy, regulatory compliance, personalization, channel orchestration, and user intent AI is collapsing what once required multiple, separate, complex, and expensive technology stacks such as CRM, content engines, analytics, and UX. What has emerged in its place is a single, integrated system capable of delivering compliant, context-specific answers instantly, and helping brands quickly and compliantly adapt to the changing needs and engagement preferences of their users. Global investment reflects this shift: the AI-in-healthcare market is estimated at $26.6 billion today, and is projected to surpass $180 billion by 2030. This is not innovation theater. It is not small-scale pilots. It is enterprise-wide infrastructure investment in an entirely new modality of engagement between brands and the clinicians and patients they serve. However, general purpose and consumer-favored generative AI tools cannot simply be slapped on top of existing pharma brand sites and be expected to deliver on this promise. Regulatory constraints, including strict regulatory review and submission requirements, demand a new architecture that combines the AI-powered experience users demand with the regulatory-led precision pharma requires. In other words, AI must be able to deliver exactly what consumers want, when they want it, while simultaneously only delivering exactly what pharma regulatory teams have approved, in the form it was approved. This constraint is not an obstacle. It is an opportunity. It is the reason the interface layer must be intentionally and thoughtfully built, and done so through the collaboration of technology and industry leaders. The Opportunity for Pharma Let’s make no mistake: whomever owns the interface layer will own the relationship that clinicians and patients have with the life-saving treatments and products they use. And this is a clear and present danger for today’s pharma companies. According to Arpa Garay, former chief commercial officer at Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) and former chief marketing officer at Merck (NYSE: MRK), "the next competitive battleground isn’t reach or channel expansion, it’s whether our science shows up precisely when and where questions are asked. As AI becomes the first point of interpretation for patients and providers, the brands that win will be the ones whose data, evidence, and value propositions are instantly accessible and contextually accurate. This shift isn’t optional. It’s central to how commercial teams will earn trust and relevance in the years ahead.” Consumer tech companies are already deploying medical-grade agents capable of triaging questions, surfacing recommendations, and shaping clinical decisions. And patients and providers alike are using them at increasing rates, asking and answering questions without ever reaching a pharma website. Health systems are likewise building their own AI-powered engagement layers, bring conversational support directly to patients and enabling more and deeper provider interactions. Pharma’s own digital front doors, the pricey brand.com websites, are at increasing risk of becoming an afterthought. The next phase of digital health will belong to organizations that recognize and embrace this shift. For pharma to keep pace, and to take its rightful and important place in the conversations patients and providers are having about its treatments, this means recognizing two fundamental truths: With pharma supplying the trusted content, and technology partners providing a compliant integration layer, the result is not just a new coat of paint on the front door that patients and providers have stopped looking for. It is an opportunity to insert pharma directly into the spaces where those same patients and providers are conversing, and to ensure that those conversations are backed by top tier science and regulatory compliance. The future of digital engagement will not be defined by assets, pages, or campaigns. It will be defined by who controls the intelligent layer that connects the right information to the right user at the right moment, regardless of channel. That requires deep, bidirectional collaboration between pharma organizations, AI-native health technology companies, and large infrastructure providers. No single party can deliver this alone. The ecosystem is too fractured, the data requirements too complex, and the compliance demands too unforgiving. A New Metric: Relevance, Not Traffic For years, digital success was measured by visits, clicks, dwell time, and bounce rates. Those metrics belong to the era of static websites. In an AI-first environment, the defining question becomes: Did the user receive the right, compliant answer at the exact moment they needed it? If a cardiologist can ask a complex, label-bound question through an embedded, approved agent, and receive a precise, context-aware response instantly, and is able to quickly proceed with the care of her patient, then why should any of us care about the channel through which that cardiologist received her answer? Driving traffic to a static website is not the purpose; it never was. The brand.com website is simply one channel among many that exist for a purpose that has never been more important: to provide clear, accessible, and accurate information to patients and providers so that they can move forward confidently in their healthcare journey and receive the care into which pharma companies invest so much to bring to life. Engagement, not activity, is the point. Leading commercial organizations are already reframing their approach, including Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN), which has been pushing its teams to think less about clicks and more about whether their science shows up when and where it’s needed most. As Murdo Gordon, executive vice president, global commercial operations at Amgen, puts it: “AI is collapsing the distance between a question and its answer. For commercial teams, that means our focus must shift from driving people to assets to ensuring our science shows up, accurately and instantly, wherever the question is asked. That’s the future of engagement and it will reshape how we measure success.” The Website Isn’t Dying, It’s Being Superseded The decline of the static pharma website is not a failure. It is the natural progression of an industry shifting from narrower, specific channels designed for one-way communication to a broader, context-aware, and conversational form of engagement. The brands that lead the next decade will not be the ones with the best websites or the largest search budgets. They will be the ones that break free from the cycle of repainting their brand.com front doors and venture out boldly into the new AI-powered world in which their patients and providers are already immersed. They will be the ones that partner with pharma-first technology companies to enable the intelligent, compliant, omnichannel layer that replaces the website entirely, the layer that meets clinicians and patients where they already are.

Title: Why the GenAI Infrastructure Boom May Break Historical Patterns

Subscribe Mihir Kshirsagar Comments Authored by Mihir Kshirsagar Observers invoke railroad, electricity, and telecom precedents when contextualizing the current generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) infrastructure boom—usually to debate whether or when we are heading for a crash. But these discussions miss an important pattern that held across all three prior cycles: when the bubbles burst, investors lost money but society gained lasting benefits. The infrastructure enabled productivity gains that monopolistic owners could not fully capture. Investors lost, but society won. GenAI threatens to break this pattern. Whether or not the bubble bursts as many anticipate, we may not get the historical consolation prize. There are two reasons to doubt that GenAI will follow this trend: First, as I discuss in my prior post, the chips powering today’s systems have short-asset lives compared to the decades-long life of infrastructure of past cycles. Companies are also actively pursuing software optimization techniques that could dramatically shrink hardware requirements. In either case, the infrastructure that is left behind after a correction is not likely to become a cheap commodity for future growth. Second, the current market is shaped by hyperscaler-led coalitions that enable surplus extraction at multiple layers. As I discuss below, the usage-based API pricing captures application value, information asymmetry enables direct competition with customers, and coalition structures subordinate model developers to infrastructure owners. If productivity gains materialize at scale, these rent extraction capabilities may enable hyperscalers to realize the revenues that justify infrastructure investment—something past infrastructure owners could not do. But whether through sustained profitability or post-bust consolidation, the structural conditions that enabled broad diffusion of benefits in past cycles are absent. Now, there are some countervailing considerations. The research and development supporting open-weight models might be a source for productivity gains to be spread more broadly, and could even serve as the “stranded assets” that enable future innovation if the bubble bursts. But the regulatory environment needs to support such initiatives. The railroad industry consolidated dramatically after the Panic of 1873. By the early 1900s, seven financial groups controlled two-thirds of the nation’s railroad mileage. J.P. Morgan’s syndicate reorganized bankrupt roads into the Southern Railway and consolidated eastern trunk lines. Edward Harriman controlled the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific systems. James J. Hill dominated northern routes through the Great Northern and Northern Pacific. This concentration raised serious antitrust concerns—the Sherman Act was passed in 1890 largely in response to railroad monopoly power. But even with consolidation, railroad owners still struggled to pay their debts because the infrastructure’s economic benefits were dispersed across the economy and did not flow back directly to the owners. Richard Hornbeck and Martin Rotemberg’s important work shows how at the aggregate level when economies have input distortions—misallocated labor, capital stuck in less productive uses, frictions in resource allocation—the railroad infrastructure can generate substantial economy-wide productivity gains. These gains persisted over decades regardless of which financial group controlled the local rail lines. Farmers in Iowa shipping grain to Chicago paid freight rates, but the productivity improvements from market access—crop specialization, mechanization investments justified by larger markets, fertilizer access—stayed with the agricultural sector. The infrastructure that enabled these gains had useful lives measured in decades. Railroad tracks laid in the 1880s remained economically viable into the 1920s and beyond. Rolling stock, locomotives, and terminal facilities similarly had useful lives of twenty to forty years. When railroads consolidated, the long-lived infrastructure continued enabling agricultural productivity gains. The consolidation was anticompetitive, but the economic benefits didn’t concentrate entirely with the infrastructure owners. Three structural constraints, beginning with the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, but only effectively imposed nearly two decades later, limited railroad owners from capturing the economic surplus generated by their investments. First, bound by common carrier obligations, railroads charged fixed rates for shipping based on weight and distance, not a share of crop value. The railroad recovered infrastructure costs plus a margin, but could not discriminate based on agricultural productivity. Second, railroads had no visibility into which farms were most productive, or which crops were most profitable beyond what could be inferred from shipping volumes. As a result, they could not observe and selectively advantage their own agricultural ventures. Third, railroads faced substantial barriers to entering agriculture; directly operating farms required different expertise, capital, and management than operating rail networks. Now, railroads did try to move upstream, but regulatory actions prevented them from extending their dominant position. Samuel Insull built a utility empire in the 1920s that collapsed spectacularly in 1932, taking over $2 billion in investor wealth with it (nearly $50 billion today). The subsequent restructuring produced regional utility monopolies—by the 1940s, electricity generation and distribution were recognized as natural monopolies requiring either public ownership or regulated private provision. This consolidation was problematic enough that Congress passed the Public Utility Holding Company Act in 1935 to break up remaining utility combinations. Despite the market correction, the generating plants and transmission infrastructure built in the 1920s and 1930s had useful lives of forty to fifty years. Even as utility ownership consolidated into regional monopolies, the long-lived infrastructure continued enabling manufacturing productivity gains that utilities sold electricity to but couldn’t capture surplus from. Cheap electricity transformed American manufacturing in ways the utilities could not fully capture. Paul David’s foundational work on the “dynamo problem” shows that electrification enabled factory reorganization—moving from centralized steam power with belt drives to distributed electric motors allowed flexible factory layouts, continuous-process manufacturing, and eventually assembly-line production. Manufacturing productivity gains from electrification were substantial and persistent, but utilities sold kilowatt-hours at regulated rates. They could not price discriminate based on which manufacturers were most innovative or extract ongoing surplus from manufacturing productivity improvements. The constraints preventing electric utilities from capturing the surplus paralleled railroads in important respects, and were also eventually imposed through regulation. Utilities charged volumetric rates for electricity consumed, not a share of manufacturing output. A factory paid based on kilowatt-hours used, whether it was producing innovative products or commodity goods. Regulation eventually standardized rate structures, limiting even the ability to price discriminate across customer classes. Utilities had minimal visibility into how electricity was being used productively—they knew aggregate consumption but couldn’t observe which production processes were most valuable. And while some utilities did integrate forward into consumer appliances to stimulate residential demand, this was primarily about increasing electricity consumption rather than controlling downstream markets. Utilities faced prohibitive barriers to entering manufacturing directly; operating generating plants and distribution networks required different capabilities than running factories. In more recent memory, the telecom bust following the dot-com crash was severe. Several competitive local exchange carriers went bankrupt between 2000 and 2003. WorldCom filed for the largest corporate bankruptcy of its time in 2002. The resulting consolidation was substantial—Level 3 Communications acquired multiple bankrupt competitors’ assets, Verizon absorbed MCI/WorldCom, AT&T was reconstituted through acquisitions. By the mid-2000s, broadband infrastructure was concentrated among a handful of major carriers. But the fiber deployed in the 1990s—much of it still in use today—enabled the internet economy to flourish. The economic productivity gains from internet access are well-documented: e-commerce, SaaS businesses, remote work, streaming services, cloud computing, and so on. The constraints limiting telecom value capture were similar to earlier cycles. Carriers primarily sold bandwidth based on monthly subscriptions or per-gigabyte charges, not revenue shares from application success. A startup building on fiber infrastructure paid the same rates as established businesses. Carriers had limited visibility into which applications were succeeding and could not easily observe application-layer innovation. And telecom providers faced substantial technical and regulatory barriers to competing at the application layer during the critical formation period. Network operators were not positioned to compete with e-commerce sites, SaaS platforms, or streaming services in the late 1990s through early 2010s when the web economy was taking shape. There were exceptions that tested these boundaries. AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner and Verizon’s forays into media ventures showed carriers trying vertical integration. And the important net neutrality debates centered on whether carriers could favor their own services or extract rents from application providers. Regardless, during the critical period when the web economy came into prominence, telecom companies were not vertically integrated and therefore their infrastructure was available on more horizontal terms. The pattern across all three historical cases is consistent. Infrastructure consolidation happened and proved sticky, raising legitimate competition concerns. But structural constraints meant even monopolistic infrastructure owners could not fully capture application-layer surplus. They charged for access to infrastructure—shipping, kilowatt-hours, bandwidth—but the productivity gains from using that infrastructure diffused broadly through the economy. The long useful lives of the infrastructure meant these spillovers persisted for decades, even as ownership consolidated. As I’ve discussed here previously, the chips powering today’s AI systems have useful lives of one to three years due to rapid technological obsolescence and physical wear from high-utilization AI workloads. This short useful life means that even if AI infrastructure spending produces excess capacity, that capacity will not be available for new entrants to acquire and leverage effectively. In railroads, electricity, and telecom, stranded assets with decades of remaining useful life became resources that others could access. Three-year-old GPUs do not provide a competitive foundation when incumbent coalitions are running current-generation hardware. Put differently, in a hypothetical 2027 GenAI bust, an over-leveraged data center stocked with 2-year-old H100s will be comparatively worthless. That compute cannot be bought for pennies on the dollar to fuel new competition. The only entities that can survive are those hyperscalers with the massive, continuous free cash flow to stay on the “GPU treadmill”—namely, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta. (Dramatic increases in software efficiency could break this hardware moat, but the hyperscalers control over distribution channels is difficult to overcome.) The combination is what changes the outcome: vertical integration that enables surplus extraction, information position that enables direct competition, coalition structure that subordinates model developers to infrastructure owners, and short asset life that prevents the emergence of reusable infrastructure that others can access. The GenAI infrastructure buildout is producing market concentration through coalition structures: Microsoft-OpenAI, Amazon-Anthropic, Google-DeepMind. These are not loose partnerships—they are deeply integrated arrangements where the hyperscaler’s infrastructure economics directly enable their coalition’s competitive positioning at the application layer. Microsoft has invested billions in OpenAI and provides exclusive Azure infrastructure. Amazon is heavily invested in Anthropic. Google acquired DeepMind and is developing Gemini models that are integrated across Google Workspace and Cloud. This vertical integration attacks all three constraints that limited value capture in past cycles. First, usage-based GenAI pricing captures application-layer surplus through uncapped rates. Historically, railroads also charged based on usage—more cargo meant higher bills—but eventually regulators imposed the requirement to charge “reasonable and just” rates. Similarly, electric utilities charge per kilowatt-hour but face state commission oversight that caps rates at cost-plus-reasonable-return. These regulatory firewalls prevented infrastructure providers with natural monopoly characteristics from extracting surplus beyond what regulators deemed justified by their costs. While GenAI providers charge uniform per-token rates, they do have common carrier obligations. Moreover, while enterprise pricing remains opaque, the structure of published rates suggests that costs scale in close proportion to usage. This pricing structure, unconstrained by rate regulation or transparent volume pricing, allows concentrated infrastructure providers to capture ongoing application-layer surplus as successful applications scale. This capability has implications beyond just who benefits. In past cycles, infrastructure owners couldn’t capture application-layer surplus, which meant projected revenues never materialized and bubbles burst. If GenAI’s rent extraction model works, it changes the financial calculus and hyperscalers may actually generate sufficient revenues to cover their capital expenditures. But this “success” would come at the cost of concentrating gains rather than diffusing them broadly. Second, API usage patterns reveal application-layer innovation. Railroads could not easily observe crop profitability, utilities could not see manufacturing processes, and telecom providers in the 1990s-2000s could not easily monitor which web applications were succeeding. Hyperscalers can see which applications are working through API call patterns, token usage, and query types. This information asymmetry could allow them to identify promising use cases and compete directly. For example, Microsoft can observe what enterprises build with OpenAI. Or Google can see which applications gain traction on Gemini. The infrastructure position provides comprehensive competitive intelligence about the application layer. Third, hyperscalers are positioned to compete at the application layer. Railroads did not enter farming, utilities did not run factories, and while some telecom providers in the 1990s tried to compete with web startups by using “walled gardens” that strategy failed. By contrast, hyperscalers are already application-layer competitors. Microsoft competes in enterprise software. Google competes in productivity tools through Workspace. They can leverage GenAI capabilities to enhance existing products while simultaneously selling API access to would-be competitors. The integration runs both directions—infrastructure enables their own applications while extracting value from others’ applications. Indeed, in the software industry there is a long history of platforms cannibalizing or “sherlocking” the applications they enable. Moreover, this dynamic differs fundamentally from how cloud services were used in the last decade. When Netflix or Uber ran on AWS, they used the cloud as a commodity utility to host their own proprietary code and business logic. Amazon provided the servers, but it was not the “brain” of the application. In the GenAI stack the application logic—the reasoning, the content generation, the analysis—resides within the infrastructure provider’s model, not the customer’s code. This shifts the relationship from hosting a business to “renting cognition,” allowing the infrastructure owner to capture a significantly higher share of the value creation. The coalition structure reinforces vertical control. OpenAI is the public face of AI innovation but is structurally dependent on Microsoft’s infrastructure. Anthropic operates primarily on AWS and is tied to Amazon’s ecosystem. Even the most prominent model developers lack true independence—they’re subordinate partners in coalitions where the hyperscaler captures value through multiple channels while retaining the option to marginalize or compete with the model developer if advantageous. In past infrastructure cycles, the implicit social bargain was clear: while investors lost, society gained. Railroad, electricity, and telecom markets all concentrated substantially after their corrections, but the infrastructure continued enabling broad economic gains that owners could not fully capture. GenAI breaks this pattern. Whether through sustained profitability (enabled by rent extraction) or through post-bust consolidation (without reusable stranded assets), we may not get the historical consolation prize. The primary counter-narrative rests with the open-weight ecosystem. A robust, competitive landscape of open models could directly challenge the structural constraints that enable surplus extraction. This open-model path, therefore, represents a critical mechanism for realizing the broad, decentralized “spillover” benefits that characterized past infrastructure cycles. Thus, supporting this ecosystem, whether through public access to compute or pro-competitive interoperability rules, should be a strategic imperative for ensuring that the productivity gains from AI diffuse broadly rather than concentrating within the hyperscaler coalitions.

Companies are also actively pursuing software optimization techniques that could dramatically shrink hardware requirements. In either case, the infrastructure that is left behind after a correction is not likely to become a cheap commodity for future growth. Second, the current market is shaped by hyperscaler-led coalitions that enable surplus extraction at multiple layers. As I discuss below, the usage-based API pricing captures application value, information asymmetry enables direct competition with customers, and coalition structures subordinate model developers to infrastructure owners. If productivity gains materialize at scale, these rent extraction capabilities may enable hyperscalers to realize the revenues that justify infrastructure investment—something past infrastructure owners could not do. But whether through sustained profitability or post-bust consolidation, the structural conditions that enabled broad diffusion of benefits in past cycles are absent. Now, there are some countervailing considerations. The research and development supporting open-weight models might be a source for productivity gains to be spread more broadly, and could even serve as the “stranded assets” that enable future innovation if the bubble bursts. But the regulatory environment needs to support such initiatives. The railroad industry consolidated dramatically after the Panic of 1873. By the early 1900s, seven financial groups controlled two-thirds of the nation’s railroad mileage. J.P. Morgan’s syndicate reorganized bankrupt roads into the Southern Railway and consolidated eastern trunk lines. Edward Harriman controlled the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific systems. James J. Hill dominated northern routes through the Great Northern and Northern Pacific. This concentration raised serious antitrust concerns—the Sherman Act was passed in 1890 largely in response to railroad monopoly power. But even with consolidation, railroad owners still struggled to pay their debts because the infrastructure’s economic benefits were dispersed across the economy and did not flow back directly to the owners. Richard Hornbeck and Martin Rotemberg’s important work shows how at the aggregate level when economies have input distortions—misallocated labor, capital stuck in less productive uses, frictions in resource allocation—the railroad infrastructure can generate substantial economy-wide productivity gains. These gains persisted over decades regardless of which financial group controlled the local rail lines. Farmers in Iowa shipping grain to Chicago paid freight rates, but the productivity improvements from market access—crop specialization, mechanization investments justified by larger markets, fertilizer access—stayed with the agricultural sector. The infrastructure that enabled these gains had useful lives measured in decades. Railroad tracks laid in the 1880s remained economically viable into the 1920s and beyond. Rolling stock, locomotives, and terminal facilities similarly had useful lives of twenty to forty years. When railroads consolidated, the long-lived infrastructure continued enabling agricultural productivity gains. The consolidation was anticompetitive, but the economic benefits didn’t concentrate entirely with the infrastructure owners. Three structural constraints, beginning with the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, but only effectively imposed nearly two decades later, limited railroad owners from capturing the economic surplus generated by their investments. First, bound by common carrier obligations, railroads charged fixed rates for shipping based on weight and distance, not a share of crop value. The railroad recovered infrastructure costs plus a margin, but could not discriminate based on agricultural productivity. Second, railroads had no visibility into which farms were most productive, or which crops were most profitable beyond what could be inferred from shipping volumes. As a result, they could not observe and selectively advantage their own agricultural ventures. Third, railroads faced substantial barriers to entering agriculture; directly operating farms required different expertise, capital, and management than operating rail networks. Now, railroads did try to move upstream, but regulatory actions prevented them from extending their dominant position. Samuel Insull built a utility empire in the 1920s that collapsed spectacularly in 1932, taking over $2 billion in investor wealth with it (nearly $50 billion today). The subsequent restructuring produced regional utility monopolies—by the 1940s, electricity generation and distribution were recognized as natural monopolies requiring either public ownership or regulated private provision. This consolidation was problematic enough that Congress passed the Public Utility Holding Company Act in 1935 to break up remaining utility combinations. Despite the market correction, the generating plants and transmission infrastructure built in the 1920s and 1930s had useful lives of forty to fifty years. Even as utility ownership consolidated into regional monopolies, the long-lived infrastructure continued enabling manufacturing productivity gains that utilities sold electricity to but couldn’t capture surplus from. Cheap electricity transformed American manufacturing in ways the utilities could not fully capture. Paul David’s foundational work on the “dynamo problem” shows that electrification enabled factory reorganization—moving from centralized steam power with belt drives to distributed electric motors allowed flexible factory layouts, continuous-process manufacturing, and eventually assembly-line production. Manufacturing productivity gains from electrification were substantial and persistent, but utilities sold kilowatt-hours at regulated rates. They could not price discriminate based on which manufacturers were most innovative or extract ongoing surplus from manufacturing productivity improvements. The constraints preventing electric utilities from capturing the surplus paralleled railroads in important respects, and were also eventually imposed through regulation. Utilities charged volumetric rates for electricity consumed, not a share of manufacturing output. A factory paid based on kilowatt-hours used, whether it was producing innovative products or commodity goods. Regulation eventually standardized rate structures, limiting even the ability to price discriminate across customer classes. Utilities had minimal visibility into how electricity was being used productively—they knew aggregate consumption but couldn’t observe which production processes were most valuable. And while some utilities did integrate forward into consumer appliances to stimulate residential demand, this was primarily about increasing electricity consumption rather than controlling downstream markets. Utilities faced prohibitive barriers to entering manufacturing directly; operating generating plants and distribution networks required different capabilities than running factories. In more recent memory, the telecom bust following the dot-com crash was severe. Several competitive local exchange carriers went bankrupt between 2000 and 2003. WorldCom filed for the largest corporate bankruptcy of its time in 2002. The resulting consolidation was substantial—Level 3 Communications acquired multiple bankrupt competitors’ assets, Verizon absorbed MCI/WorldCom, AT&T was reconstituted through acquisitions. By the mid-2000s, broadband infrastructure was concentrated among a handful of major carriers. But the fiber deployed in the 1990s—much of it still in use today—enabled the internet economy to flourish. The economic productivity gains from internet access are well-documented: e-commerce, SaaS businesses, remote work, streaming services, cloud computing, and so on. The constraints limiting telecom value capture were similar to earlier cycles. Carriers primarily sold bandwidth based on monthly subscriptions or per-gigabyte charges, not revenue shares from application success. A startup building on fiber infrastructure paid the same rates as established businesses. Carriers had limited visibility into which applications were succeeding and could not easily observe application-layer innovation. And telecom providers faced substantial technical and regulatory barriers to competing at the application layer during the critical formation period. Network operators were not positioned to compete with e-commerce sites, SaaS platforms, or streaming services in the late 1990s through early 2010s when the web economy was taking shape. There were exceptions that tested these boundaries. AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner and Verizon’s forays into media ventures showed carriers trying vertical integration. And the important net neutrality debates centered on whether carriers could favor their own services or extract rents from application providers. Regardless, during the critical period when the web economy came into prominence, telecom companies were not vertically integrated and therefore their infrastructure was available on more horizontal terms. The pattern across all three historical cases is consistent. Infrastructure consolidation happened and proved sticky, raising legitimate competition concerns. But structural constraints meant even monopolistic infrastructure owners could not fully capture application-layer surplus. They charged for access to infrastructure—shipping, kilowatt-hours, bandwidth—but the productivity gains from using that infrastructure diffused broadly through the economy. The long useful lives of the infrastructure meant these spillovers persisted for decades, even as ownership consolidated. As I’ve discussed here previously, the chips powering today’s AI systems have useful lives of one to three years due to rapid technological obsolescence and physical wear from high-utilization AI workloads. This short useful life means that even if AI infrastructure spending produces excess capacity, that capacity will not be available for new entrants to acquire and leverage effectively. In railroads, electricity, and telecom, stranded assets with decades of remaining useful life became resources that others could access. Three-year-old GPUs do not provide a competitive foundation when incumbent coalitions are running current-generation hardware. Put differently, in a hypothetical 2027 GenAI bust, an over-leveraged data center stocked with 2-year-old H100s will be comparatively worthless. That compute cannot be bought for pennies on the dollar to fuel new competition. The only entities that can survive are those hyperscalers with the massive, continuous free cash flow to stay on the “GPU treadmill”—namely, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta. (Dramatic increases in software efficiency could break this hardware moat, but the hyperscalers control over distribution channels is difficult to overcome.) The combination is what changes the outcome: vertical integration that enables surplus extraction, information position that enables direct competition, coalition structure that subordinates model developers to infrastructure owners, and short asset life that prevents the emergence of reusable infrastructure that others can access. The GenAI infrastructure buildout is producing market concentration through coalition structures: Microsoft-OpenAI, Amazon-Anthropic, Google-DeepMind. These are not loose partnerships—they are deeply integrated arrangements where the hyperscaler’s infrastructure economics directly enable their coalition’s competitive positioning at the application layer. Microsoft has invested billions in OpenAI and provides exclusive Azure infrastructure. Amazon is heavily invested in Anthropic. Google acquired DeepMind and is developing Gemini models that are integrated across Google Workspace and Cloud. This vertical integration attacks all three constraints that limited value capture in past cycles. First, usage-based GenAI pricing captures application-layer surplus through uncapped rates. Historically, railroads also charged based on usage—more cargo meant higher bills—but eventually regulators imposed the requirement to charge “reasonable and just” rates. Similarly, electric utilities charge per kilowatt-hour but face state commission oversight that caps rates at cost-plus-reasonable-return. These regulatory firewalls prevented infrastructure providers with natural monopoly characteristics from extracting surplus beyond what regulators deemed justified by their costs. While GenAI providers charge uniform per-token rates, they do have common carrier obligations. Moreover, while enterprise pricing remains opaque, the structure of published rates suggests that costs scale in close proportion to usage. This pricing structure, unconstrained by rate regulation or transparent volume pricing, allows concentrated infrastructure providers to capture ongoing application-layer surplus as successful applications scale. This capability has implications beyond just who benefits. In past cycles, infrastructure owners couldn’t capture application-layer surplus, which meant projected revenues never materialized and bubbles burst. If GenAI’s rent extraction model works, it changes the financial calculus and hyperscalers may actually generate sufficient revenues to cover their capital expenditures. But this “success” would come at the cost of concentrating gains rather than diffusing them broadly. Second, API usage patterns reveal application-layer innovation. Railroads could not easily observe crop profitability, utilities could not see manufacturing processes, and telecom providers in the 1990s-2000s could not easily monitor which web applications were succeeding. Hyperscalers can see which applications are working through API call patterns, token usage, and query types. This information asymmetry could allow them to identify promising use cases and compete directly. For example, Microsoft can observe what enterprises build with OpenAI. Or Google can see which applications gain traction on Gemini. The infrastructure position provides comprehensive competitive intelligence about the application layer. Third, hyperscalers are positioned to compete at the application layer. Railroads did not enter farming, utilities did not run factories, and while some telecom providers in the 1990s tried to compete with web startups by using “walled gardens” that strategy failed. By contrast, hyperscalers are already application-layer competitors. Microsoft competes in enterprise software. Google competes in productivity tools through Workspace. They can leverage GenAI capabilities to enhance existing products while simultaneously selling API access to would-be competitors. The integration runs both directions—infrastructure enables their own applications while extracting value from others’ applications. Indeed, in the software industry there is a long history of platforms cannibalizing or “sherlocking” the applications they enable. Moreover, this dynamic differs fundamentally from how cloud services were used in the last decade. When Netflix or Uber ran on AWS, they used the cloud as a commodity utility to host their own proprietary code and business logic. Amazon provided the servers, but it was not the “brain” of the application. In the GenAI stack the application logic—the reasoning, the content generation, the analysis—resides within the infrastructure provider’s model, not the customer’s code. This shifts the relationship from hosting a business to “renting cognition,” allowing the infrastructure owner to capture a significantly higher share of the value creation. The coalition structure reinforces vertical control. OpenAI is the public face of AI innovation but is structurally dependent on Microsoft’s infrastructure. Anthropic operates primarily on AWS and is tied to Amazon’s ecosystem. Even the most prominent model developers lack true independence—they’re subordinate partners in coalitions where the hyperscaler captures value through multiple channels while retaining the option to marginalize or compete with the model developer if advantageous. In past infrastructure cycles, the implicit social bargain was clear: while investors lost, society gained. Railroad, electricity, and telecom markets all concentrated substantially after their corrections, but the infrastructure continued enabling broad economic gains that owners could not fully capture. GenAI breaks this pattern. Whether through sustained profitability (enabled by rent extraction) or through post-bust consolidation (without reusable stranded assets), we may not get the historical consolation prize. The primary counter-narrative rests with the open-weight ecosystem. A robust, competitive landscape of open models could directly challenge the structural constraints that enable surplus extraction. This open-model path, therefore, represents a critical mechanism for realizing the broad, decentralized “spillover” benefits that characterized past infrastructure cycles. Thus, supporting this ecosystem, whether through public access to compute or pro-competitive interoperability rules, should be a strategic imperative for ensuring that the productivity gains from AI diffuse broadly rather than concentrating within the hyperscaler coalitions.

Title: 5 reasons Google is having a moment

Every time Hugh publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Google is on a tear right now — but its success in the AI race wasn't always guaranteed. In late 2022, OpenAI captured the moment with the release of ChatGPT. After a number of fumbles as Google struggled to get its own chatbot out the door, some of the closest Google watchers were calling for CEO Sundar Pichai to step down. Nearly three years later, Google has performed a miraculous turnaround. Its new AI model, Gemini 3, is proving such a win that Marc Benioff said he's switching from ChatGPT. Google has just surpassed Microsoft's market cap and is on its way to a $4 trillion status. Its stock price is up nearly 70% this year. It's a signal that Google — which has always held the various pieces to compete — has finally got everything working in harmony, all the way from the models up to the platforms like Search that put them in users' hands. In the fast-moving AI race, no victory is secure — but Google has never looked stronger. Here's why. Gemini 3 rolled out to the public last week with rave reviews. It outperforms its predecessor in coding, design, and analysis, and surpasses competing models in benchmark tests. As we at Business Insider discovered, it's highly adept at designing websites and basic video games, giving it broader use beyond coding. The new model has allayed some fears that Google was too far behind rivals and that scaling laws — rules that say AI models improve with more data and compute — were slowing down. The company's stock price has increased by more than 12% since the rollout of Gemini 3 on November 18. Google has spent over a decade developing its own chips for internal use. Known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Google has used these chips to train its Gemini models. That's a great advertisement as Google hopes more companies will adopt the chips for their own models. Google sells access to its TPUs through its cloud business and has made a significant internal push in recent months to attract more customers. That could pose a long-term threat to Nvidia's business. Google is currently in discussions for a blockbuster deal with Meta worth billions of dollars, which would potentially host some of Google's chips in one of Meta's own data centers, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The Information first reported on the arrangement, which sent the shares of chip companies like AMD and Nvidia tumbling on Tuesday. In September, a federal judge handed down penalties for an antitrust lawsuit brought against Google's search business in 2020. Those penalties, which threatened to tear up Google's lucrative search empire, amounted to little more than a slap on the wrist. Google was told it could continue making payments to partners such as Apple for default status, but could not do so exclusively. It was also ordered to share some search data with rivals. At one point, Google's Chrome browser was on the chopping block, which could have severed a crucial part of Google's search-advertising flywheel. Despite the judge ruling that Google had acted as a monopoly, the company came away relatively unscathed. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway built a $4.3 billion stake in Google parent company Alphabet last quarter, a regulatory filing revealed. That's notable for two reasons. Other than Apple, Buffett has tended to avoid tech stocks. He has also historically avoided expensive, high-growth companies. As Buffett prepares to step back as CEO, the decision to finally bet on Google — something he said he wished he'd done long ago — suggests strong confidence in the search giant. Google's core moneymaker is still search advertising, and one of the big investor fears has been how Google's self-disruption might hurt its cash cow. Not a lot, apparently: Search revenues jumped 15% in the third quarter, suggesting that even if AI is hurting some websites' traffic, it's not harming Google's business. In fact, Google says generative AI is causing people to search more than ever. The company is currently testing ads in AI Mode, its chatbot-like version of search that is gradually feeling like less of an experiment and more like Google's vision for how search will eventually work.

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Who’s most exposed when the AI rally finally comes to an end? What you’re missing: The Reset is a newsletter we send out every Sunday to the corporate enterprise subscribers to WrapPRO. If you think your company or organization would be interested in signing up for an enterprise plan, please reach out to our head of enterprise sales, Kimberly Donnan, at kimberly.donnan@thewrap.com. Happy Sunday, Part of any daily dialogue these days seems to include the argument over whether we are in an AI bubble. The sentiment changes almost hourly while the camp of of not if but when is picking up momentum. But it’s a rollercoaster. SoftBank selling its nearly $6 billion stake in Nvidia fueled bubble theories, but Nvidia’s knockout quarter reported on Wednesday seemed to shut those down — for now. The analysts’ estimates vary widely projecting that from 40% to as much as 75% of the stock market’s gains this year are attributable to AI-related equities. Either way, it’s substantial. This chart from Bank of America Global Research highlights the ongoing concerns of fund managers through a new November survey. Hollywood and the larger media sector have had a love-hate relationship with AI so far, which begs the question that if we are indeed in a bubble and that bubble bursts, how bad will it hurt business? Here’s a few thoughts on those with the most exposure: Netflix — A robust early adopter of AI for content personalization, dubbing, localizing programming, and automated trailer production has high exposure. Those tools depend on early-stage AI vendors that would get crushed if a bubble burst. Bottom line is that localization efforts, key to building sub growth outside U.S., would get more expensive. Disney — With its internal efforts at integrating AI stalling, Disney is increasingly looking at partners to help with production and VFX. It’s also beginning to use AI-driven personalization and robotics at its parks. A bubble burst would mean fewer outside options to fully take advantage of the capabilities of AI. Warner Bros. Discovery — AI isn’t much of a presence at WBD beyond the promise of the technology cutting costs from everything to marketing to production. WBD is pitching as positive a narrative as it can to Wall Street right now as it shops itself. The bubble bursting would kill that narrative, but presumably CEO David Zaslav would have sold the company already. Sony — Sony Animation and Crunchyroll are testing AI-dependent localization and subtitling pipelines. Its gigantic gaming division is experimenting with AI in the creative process, especially at the intersection of film and TV IP. What’s more, VFX shops, like Framestore, Weta FX and DNEG, are getting help from AI on so-called rotoscoping, upscaling and simulation. Same story: This kind of help comes from startups that would be wiped out in a bubble burst. It’s worth considering, too, the growing divergence between AI stocks and consumer sentiment, as the Wall Street Journal’s Greg Ip pointed out last week, highlighted by this chart. The so-called Magnificent Seven include Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Tesla. Stepping back, an AI bubble burst would not kill innovation in Hollywood, to be clear. But it will be a setback and likely force the delay of any planned technology rollouts. One upside, I guess, is that a bubble burst might take some of the tension out of labor relations that have been rocky since AI arrived on the scene. Enjoy your Thanksgiving and see you back here next Sunday. Tom LowrySenior Vice President/Editorial Strategytom.lowry@thewrap.com 1. U.S. Political Divide Revealed on Social A recent survey from Statista Consumer Insights reflects pretty much the U.S. political divide on an even basis. Some light differences do show up in the survey conducted between October 2024 and this past September; Facebook is where centrists feel most at home. X is where partisanship is most visible, with more users leaning right. No surprises there. LinkedIn also leans more right with its more business-focused user base. Reddit is the one platform of those included in the survey that leans left. BlueSky, which was created at a time when Elon Musk took control of the old Twitter, was not included in the survey. 2. Streaming’s Sticker Shock We all feel the weight of subscriptions we are carrying but this chart fromLeverage Shares brings it all home. It shows the price changes for the most popular streaming services since 2019, with Disney+ topping the list at 172% inflation, a factor that probably made it easier for subscribers to drop the service over parent company’s decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel. The inflation gives you pause to remember that streaming was created, in part, to be the low-cost alternative to traditional pay platforms like cable and satellite. But content is expensive and growth slows, and streamers feel like they’ve got the pricing power. But for how long? The work of determining the fate of Warner Bros. Discovery begins in earnest now. With bids submitted at Thursday’s deadline, let the due diligence begin. CEO David Zaslav will no doubt be leaning heavily on a team of advisors, no one more so than Paul Gould, the veteran investment banker with Allen & Co., one of the firms WBD hired to navigate a potential sale or split of the company. Allen & Co. has been advising media companies for more than half a century and Gould has been part of the team there since 1972. He is also an independent director on the WBD board, and has a long history of working with one of the company’s largest individual shareholders, billionaire cable mogul John Malone. The boutique investment bank is probably best-known for hosting its annual gathering of media, entertainment and tech executives every July in Sun Valley, Idaho. Gould is a fixture there. The confab has become known as the “billionaire’s summer camp.” But unlike the outsized personalities of the executives he serves, Gould is happy behind the scenes and famously press shy. In fact, the only photo we could find of him is the above picture from Sun Valley more than 10 years ago, walking alongside Malone. Gould has been an advisor on thousands of deals over the decades. Allen’s recent record includes the AT&T / Time Warner deal in 2016, advising Time Warner in its $108 billion acquisition by AT&T; advising Activision in 2022 in the nearly $70 billion acquisition by Microsoft; the firm advised on the 2015 separation of eBay and PayPal, a deal valued at $49.16 billion, the firm also brokered the Jeff Bezos’ 2013 acquisition of The Washington Post. The play for Warner Bros. Discovery is one of the biggest and most high-profile bidding wars in recent years for any company, not just in media. Zaslav will continue to be the public face of the unfolding drama. But you can’t underestimate the investment banker whose team is busy behind the scenes with an opinion or two about the potential buyer that will make the most sense.

Major U.S. equities indexes gained Tuesday afternoon, extending Monday's rally to start a holiday-shortened trading week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up over 1%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ticked 0.1% higher. Kohl's (KSS) saw its shares surge 35% after the department store chain reported a surprise third-quarter profit. The results came a day after the retailer said it would remove the "interim" tag from CEO Michael Bender's title to take over the top job permanently after its prior CEO lasted just months before being ousted over allegations of improper dealings with a vendor. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) was another retailer that soared Tuesday, with shares up 30% after the company topped third-quarter earnings estimates. Sales growth has slowed among its namesake brand, but picked up for Hollister, which executives said is expected to carry the company's sales for the holiday season. Videoconference software maker Zoom Communications (ZM) also posted quarterly results that topped analysts' estimates, sending shares 12% higher. The company said it is seeing meaningful adoption of its AI offerings. Nvidia (NVDA) shares sank close to 4%, making the stock one of the biggest decliners in the S&P 500 Tuesday following a report that Meta Platforms (META) is considering using chips from Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).

US-based technology giant Amazon announced its plans to invest up to $50 billion into the expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) and supercomputing capabilities for the US government agencies through its Amazon Web Services (AWS), according to an official announcement. Amazon's investment in the expansion is aimed at improving the discovery and decision-making ability of the government agencies as they integrate their simulation and modeling data with AI, autonomous experimental steering and real-time feedback loops. “Our investment in purpose-built government AI and cloud infrastructure will fundamentally transform how federal agencies leverage supercomputing,” said AWS CEO Matt Garman. “This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.” Amazon Web Services' (AWS) up to $50 billion investment is set to add nearly 1.3 gigawatts of AI and supercomputing capacity across AWS Top Secret, AWS Secret, and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. The company will build data centres with advanced computing and networking technology power as part of its expansion efforts. According to the official announcement, the federal government agencies will gain expanded access to AWS's comprehensive AI services, including Amazon SageMaker AI, Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Nova, and Anthropic Claude, among other things. “These new capabilities will be available to existing and future U.S. government customers across AWS Top Secret, AWS Secret, and GovCloud (US) Regions, strengthening America's AI leadership and giving federal agencies the secure, scalable infrastructure they need for the next era of innovation,” the company said in its announcement. The investment will also contribute to critical US government and industrial base missions ranging from national security to scientific research and innovation, which includes autonomous systems development, cybersecurity, energy innovation, and healthcare research. According to a recent report from CNBC, Amazon's move comes after Meta and Anthropic's decision to expand AI data centres in the United States, and Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank's plan to invest $500 billion in the country's AI infrastructure. Amazon share price jumped more than 1% to $228.64 during the intraday trading session on Tuesday as of 11:53 a.m. (IST), compared to $226.28 at the previous US stock market session, according to the MarketWatch data. Shares of the tech and e-commerce giant have given more than 43% returns in the last five years, and over 14% returns in the last one-year period. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Amazon shares are trading 4.39% higher in 2025. The shares of Amazon hit their 52-week high level at $258.60, while the 52-week low level stood at $161.38, according to the MarketWatch data. The company's market capitalisation (M-Cap) stood at $2.42 trillion as of the stock market session on Tuesday, 25 November 2025.

Title: Apple Sales Layoffs Hit Dozens Despite Record Revenue

The company frames the move as restructuring rather than financial trouble, potentially signaling a shift toward third-party resellers and new strategic priorities. When business is good, companies tend to hire more people in order to meet the demand. However, when business is bad or slow, that’s when companies conduct layoffs. But are things going badly at Apple, so much so that the company is conducting layoffs across different sales roles? That’s what’s allegedly happening, according to a report from Bloomberg. According to the report, Apple has eliminated roles primarily within its enterprise sales division. The affected positions include account managers handling corporate, education, and government clients. It also includes employees at Apple’s briefing centers, where the company hosts high-level product demonstrations for major customers. However, this shouldn’t be interpreted as Apple doing badly. Instead, Apple frames these layoffs at its sales division as a restructuring to streamline operations and eliminate overlapping responsibilities. The company says it’s still hiring in other areas and has encouraged affected staff to apply for open internal positions. Some employees have been given deadlines to find new roles within Apple before receiving their severance packages. According to some affected employees, they believe the company is shifting more enterprise business to third-party resellers. This means potentially reduced salary and support costs. The government sales team appears to be hit particularly hard. The division was already struggling with federal budget constraints and a prolonged US government shutdown that slowed the closing of deals. Apple has built a reputation for treating layoffs as an absolute last resort. While competitors spent 2023 and 2024 cutting thousands of positions, Apple largely avoided massive workforce reductions. This is versus other tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. These companies slashed thousands of jobs during recent downturns. What makes these Apple sales layoffs interesting and kind of weird is the timing. The company recently reported approximately $140 billion in revenue for the December quarter. Like we said, companies tend to cut jobs when things are bad. But cutting jobs during strong financial performance sends a different message. Perhaps this is Apple’s way of diverting its resources to other investments, like in AI, where it appears to be currently struggling. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: The Railway Bubble vs. the AI Bubble

Time Published: 2025-11-25T16:45:13Z

A Wealth of Common Sense Posted November 25, 2025 by Ben Carlson Everyone is trying to put the massive AI spend by technology companies into context. The easiest historical analogies are the telecomm buildout in the 1990s dot-com bubble and the railway bubbles of the 1800s. Each period was defined by excessive infrastructure spending, investor euphoria, and bubbles that popped but still had lasting positive effects. I’m familiar with the railway bubble because I wrote an entire chapter about that time frame in my book Don’t Fall For It. While the similarities between then and now are striking, there were far more nefarious activities that occurred during the 19th century. What follows is a condensed version of what appeared in my book. ******* Innovation breeds change, change breeds emotion, and emotion adds fuel to the fire when making money decisions. There’s a reason financial bubbles are called manias — they elicit heightened levels of energy, excitement, and activity. Hucksters are drawn to financial manias like moths to a flame because it’s easier to deceive people when they think humanity is entering a “new era” or “paradigm shift.” George Hudson saw the British railway bubble of the mid-19th century as an opportune time to profit from the excitement in the air. There was a wave of innovation taking place, and the emotions of the crowd who were looking to get rich quickly led to one of the more underrated historical bubbles on record. Like most bubbles, the railway mania actually started out as a good idea that was taken too far by investors and those selling railway projects alike. The first commuter trains appeared in the United Kingdom during the 1820s. They traveled just 12.5 miles per hour which reduced the trip from London to Glasgow to 24 hours. Without a hint of sarcasm The Railway Times asked, “What more could any reasonable man want?” The initial railway mania hit in 1825 with the opening of the first steam engine train. An economic downturn snuffed out any speculation and by 1840, shares of the main railway companies were selling at a discount to their issue price (stocks acted more like bonds than stocks back then). At this point, 2,000 miles of track were complete, leading some to speculate that the national railway system in Britain was already finished. Memories are short when people think there’s money to be made so this first mini-mania in railway stocks became a distant memory by the summer of 1842. That’s when Prince Albert of the Royal Family persuaded Queen Victoria to make her first train ride. That was the all-clear investors needed to hop aboard the railway-stock train. By 1844, investors viewed these companies as safe and secure, with huge upside potential. It didn’t take long for that cautious optimism to morph into reckless euphoria. George Hudson was one of the original modern capitalists, using publicity, salesmanship, and a cult of personality to attract enormous amounts of capital and goodwill from the public. Best described by his contemporaries as energetic, abrasive, bullying, penny pinching, rule-bending and overweight, Hudson was also a shrewd businessman who knew how to persuade people. Innovation helped trains travel further distances and carry heavier loads so Hudson pounced on the opportunity by creating his own line of railways in the 1830s. Through a series of consolidations, mergers, schemes, bribes, acquisitions, and an uncanny ability to sell, Hudson consolidated more power than anyone in the industry, eventually creating the largest railway company in Britain. By 1844, Hudson oversaw one-third of the total tracks in operation, measuring over one thousand miles in distance. He was the embodiment of the get-rich-quick era of the railway mania. Company heads were not paid the astronomical sums CEOs can earn today so Hudson became frustrated with how little he was earning for his work. Cutting corners was his solution to increase his wealth. Auditing was basically non-existent at the time which allowed Hudson to go nuts. He did this by keeping his fellow directors and shareholders in the dark about the inner workings of his companies. This included a refusal to hold finance meetings, changes to accounting methods, and general obfuscation about the financial statements. When Hudson joined the board of one railway company in 1842, his first order of business was announcing an immediate change to the company’s accounting methods, proclaiming, “I will have no statistics on my railway!” Nearly five hundred new railway companies were in existence by the summer of 1845, with stock prices in the sector up a cool 500 percent. As share prices rose during the 1840s so too did Hudson’s bank account. The palatial estate he purchased at the entrance to Hyde Park was the largest private home in all of London. His name became synonymous with success as the mere mention of his name by promoters provided enough credibility for the sale of stock on a new railway project. Hudson quickly became one of the most prominent figures in the social and political class of Great Britain in the nineteenth century through a combination of wealth, fame, and charisma. Although he was skilled at selling, Hudson didn’t exactly have to twist anyone’s arm to invest in these new products. Money was flowing in faster than Usain Bolt with the wind at his back. By June 1945 the Board of Trade was considering over eight thousand miles of new railway, which was four times more than the existing system and almost twenty times the length of England. There were literally plans for tracks that started nowhere and went nowhere with no stops along the way. The estimated cost of the nearly twelve hundred railways under consideration was more than £560 million. That was more than the national income of the entire country! The most mind-boggling aspect of all this money pouring in is that it all came from private investors. This wasn’t the government investing in the infrastructure of their country but investors who were looking to get rich. There were just three railway journals at the outset of the 1840s, led by the Railway Times. By the time the mania reached its zenith in 1845, there were fourteen bi-weekly railway papers, two daily editions, and one which was published every day in both the morning and the evening. At the start of 1845, sixteen new railway proposals were underway and over 50 new companies were formed to meet this demand. Advertisements flooded the newspapers and periodicals. The media pounced on the Queen Victoria train ride, proclaiming the railways as a revolutionary development for mankind, sparking interest from the public in all things rail travel. Hudson was far ahead of the game in terms of understanding the power of the press and how to use it to expand his empire. It helped that he had a financial interest in three newspapers that would all run flattering pieces about his projects to attract investors. There is a rumor that Hudson even tried to support a radical new publication called the Daily News and have Charles Dickens as the editor. Dickens was not a fan of Hudson and supposedly remarked, “that he [Dickens] should be the last man in the world to be a supporter of it.” The schemes worked like this: newspaper ads would promise a 10 percent dividend for anyone who put money into a new railway project. If the project got enough funding, the directors would hold onto a large allocation of shares in the newly formed corporation. This created enough scarcity to push up the price from the flood of new investors which thereby allowed the directors to flood the market with their shares by selling at a premium price. George Hudson was a master at this scheme, promising unsustainable dividend yields of 50 percent to inflate the share prices on certain issues, which only encouraged more insider trading by himself and the company directors. These were blatant pump and dump schemes. The investing public didn’t seem to care. Parliament published a report in the summer of 1845 revealing the identity of twenty thousand investors who had subscribed for at least £2,000 or more worth of railway stocks. Hudson’s name was on there, of course, but so were 157 members of Parliament and almost 260 clergymen. Investors included the likes of Charles Darwin, John Stuart Mill, and the Bronte sisters. Darwin is said to have lost up to 60 percent in the aftermath of the mania and that was actually much better than most fared in the bloodbath that followed. The rest were mostly regular people, showing how broad the speculation was. Many investors were subscribed for more shares than they could ever hope to pay for but the idea was they would all have the chance to sell at a premium before getting all of their capital called in to create the actual railway projects. Most people assumed the greater fool theory applied but no one planned on being the last fool standing. The mania was particularly strong in the suburbs because these were the areas that could see the biggest impact from the infrastructure buildout from the new train tracks. In one town, there was a group of stockbrokers who would take an express train twice a day to relay information from one town to the next on the latest changes in share prices for the railway stocks. Practically all the money for the construction of the railways came from individuals. By 1850, the amount invested was around £250 million, almost half the GDP of Great Britain at the time. There’s an old saying that markets take the stairs up but the elevator down and the railway stocks were no different. Rising interest rates were the first pinprick in the railway bubble in the summer of 1845. Increased competition and overinvestment finally brought these companies back to earth. Bankruptcies hit an all-time high in 1846, just a year after the height of the mania. People from all walks of life and levels of wealth were ruined. By the start of 1850, railway share prices had fallen an astronomical 85 percent on average. By 1849, Hudson’s role as Railway King came to an unceremonious end. Four of the railway companies he was heavily involved in were under investigation. The shady personal transactions, embezzlement of company funds, overstating of profits, bribing members of Parliament to push his projects through, and insider trading schemes were all made public. The twelve reports produced about his business dealings forever changed public perception of the once-revered businessman. The high society Hudson so eagerly sought to be a part of immediately turned their back on him. Hudson was never prosecuted in a court of law because securities laws at the time didn’t protect shareholders the way they do now. But he was tried and convicted in the court of public opinion and ostracized by the elite class, which may have been even more of a blow to his gigantic ego. The press sang Hudson’s praises when things were going well but turned their back on him when things went awry. The Railway Times published what was basically his business obituary but they also came down hard on the investors who went along for the ride: He no more caused the railway mania than Napoleon caused the French Revolution. He was its child, its ornaments, and its boast. His talent for organisation was prodigious. No labour or speculation seemed to vast for his powers. He combined and systematised the attacks of a hundred bands upon the public purse; he raised all the fares, he lowered the speed, he reduced the establishments, he ‘cooked’ all the reports, and he trebled all the shares. The shareholders wanted their dividends doubled, and their shares raised to a proportionate market value, They never calculated the extent to which these achievements were honestly practicable, or considered the measures to which it would be necessary to resort. They wanted the trick done all at once and Hudson was the man to do it. Hudson was able to stay afloat in political life for a few years after the bubble had burst but was eventually arrested for not paying his debts and died broke years later. A large number of tech start-ups with seemingly good ideas went out of business after the dot-com flameout. But that era planted the seeds for the next wave of innovation that occurred, which gave us services like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said, “All those ideas are working today. I can’t think of a single idea from that era that isn’t working today.” The railway boom and bust had some positive outcomes as well. Not all was lost from this period of untamed speculation, greed, and accounting fraud. By 1855, there were over 8,000 miles of railroad track in operation, giving Britain the highest density of railroad tracks in the world, measuring seven times the length of France or Germany. The railways set up during the bubble years came to represent 90 percent of the total length of the current British railway system. People and businesses across the country experienced massive gains in efficiency through cheaper and faster transportation of raw materials, finished products, and passengers. During the 1840s more than half a million people were employed by the railway companies to make those tracks a reality. Tens of thousands of people from Ireland were provided employment throughout their famine years. In many ways, this was a wealth transfer from rich and middle-class speculators to the labor class that simultaneously provided the country with much needed transportation infrastructure. News distribution spread, and the capital markets became more mature. New stock markets were set up in cities all over the country. Stock brokerage firms grew from six in 1830 to almost thirty by 1847. There was greater innovation during the industrial revolution of the eighteenth century but the railway boom required far more capital, and thus investors, so this changed the way the middle class invested their money. The problem for those trying to handicap the financial ramifications of this innovation is that the economic impact doesn’t always occur at the same time. Investors extrapolate innovation indefinitely into the future, carrying prices too far, too fast. It took time for the combustion engine to completely replace the horse and carriage. The promises of the Internet came true, but we had to live through the dot-com crash to get there. Excitement pervades when new technologies are released. Most of the early car companies flamed out. As car ownership first took off in the 1920s there were 108 automakers in the U.S. By the 1950s, they were whittled down to the big three. The entire airline industry basically lost money or went out of business in the century after air travel was invented. But investors become so enthusiastic they never stop to wonder what could go wrong, only how the world could change, and more importantly, how rich they will become in the process. The siren song of innovation means there will invariably be a new gold rush every time we collectively get excited about a shiny new toy. Those innovations may change the way we live but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to make you wealthy in the process. ******* I wrote this 6 years ago before ChatGPT was a thing and no one was talking about AI. It’s interesting to revisit now. Is AI the next railway bubble? The next dot-com bubble? It might not be the worst outcome.

Title: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Bet on This Big Tech Stock. Should You?

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has placed a big bet on one of the tech’s hottest stocks. Berkshire (BRK.A)(BRK.B) purchased 17.8 million shares of Alphabet’s Class A stock (GOOGL) in the third quarter, according to a regulatory filing made public earlier this month. A stake of that size in the Google parent would be worth nearly $5.7 billion as of Monday's close. Alphabet is an unusual purchase for Berkshire, which tends to buy unloved stocks with the intention of holding them long term. Alphabet, meanwhile, is far from unloved. The stock soared more than 6% Monday after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff praised its Gemini 3 AI model, saying he was “never going back” to using rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Later Monday, news reports—first published by The Information—indicated that it might sell AI chips to Meta Platforms (META), further strengthening investors' sense of the company's position. Alphabet shares added nearly 2% on Tuesday. Berkshire Hathaway is known for investing in companies with slow-and-steady businesses and, in the firm's opinion, undervalued stocks, making its Alphabet purchase a relatively unusual one. Not only is Alphabet a member of the Magnificent Seven—the high-flying set of tech stocks whose valuations have spooked investors of late—it’s also the best-performing member of the group by a long shot this year. Shares are up about 70%, more than double Nvidia's (NVDA) year-to-date return as of Tuesday's close. Alphabet isn’t the only Mag 7 stock in Berkshire’s portfolio. Apple (AAPL) is the conglomerate’s largest stock holding, worth about $65.7 billion. But it first bought Apple stock in 2016 and has been trimming that position for the past two years. Berkshire sold about 15% of its stake in the iPhone maker last quarter. Analysts are generally bullish on Alphabet stock. JPMorgan analysts raised their price target by 13% after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results late last month. The analysts called the report “strong across the board,” and noted Alphabet was showing “signs that AI search is more opportunity than threat,” contrary to Wall Street’s expectations. Analysts at Wedbush also raised their price target, and argued the quarter "validates Alphabet's position as a leading AI beneficiary.” Alphabet also raised its full-year capital expenditures guidance last month. It expects to invest more than $90 billion in capital equipment this year, with much of that going toward building data centers and filling them with chips to train and run AI models. Investors have recently grown wary of tech's AI spending, with some wondering when they'll see a return on their investments, if at all. Regardless, 12 of the 15 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha rate shares a “buy,” and the remainder recommend holding the stock. Their average price target of $324 is right about where the stock closed on Tuesday. UPDATE: This article has been updated to include the latest stock price information.

Google co-founder Larry Page is now the second-richest person in the world, just after Tesla CEO Elon Musk. thanks to a bumper and ongoing rally in Alphabet stocks. Larry Page on Monday dethroned Oracle's Larry Ellison to snatch the position, according to the Forbes Real Time Billionaires List.

Alphabet stock price today continued its rally to touch an all-time high at premarket trading on Tuesday, rising over 3%. As per Forbes Real Time Billionaires list, the net worth of Larry Page stood at $267.5 billion on Tuesday.

On Monday alone, Larry Page's net worth climbed by $8.7 billion as per Forbes, thanks to the rally in Alphabet shares. The rally in Page's personal wealth over the past five years is impressive too, going from $50.9 billion in 2020 to $144 billion at the beginning of 2025. By the years end, he touched the quarter-trillion dollar mark. Larry Page is the co-founder of Google, one of the world's most recognised and valuable companies. Page founded the company with Stanford PhD student Sergey Brin in 1998, and used to be the CEO of Alphabet — the parent company of Google. Larry Page vacated the CEO office in 2019 but continued to remain a stakeholder at the company, which explains the meteoric surge in his wealth. At Google, he was the CEO till 2001. Shares of Google parent Alphabet have rallied almost 70% this year, outperforming other megacaps and bringing it close to the prized $4 trillion market capitalisation. Alphabet climbed 3.7% in premarket trading, bringing the search giant closer to a $4 trillion valuation. The rally came after the Information reported that Meta Platforms Inc. is in talks to spend billions of dollars on the search giant’s artificial intelligence chips. Meta is in discussions to use the chips — known as tensor processing units, or TPUs — in data centers in 2027, according to the Information, which cited an unidentified person familiar with the talks. Meta also may rent chips from Google’s cloud division next year, the news outlet said. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Apple Reportedly Cuts Dozens of Jobs Across Its Sales Division

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. Apple is reportedly cutting dozens of sales jobs to eliminate redundancy, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the development. While the exact number of jobs eliminated is unclear, affected employees were notified in the last couple of weeks. Unlike layoffs at other tech giants, those at Apple have until Jan. 20 to find a new position within the company or leave with a severance package, the report adds. Since Apple's primary goal is reportedly to improve the way it presents its products to businesses, schools, and governments, eliminated roles include account managers serving these institutions, as well as employees who manage product demos and briefing centers for them. "To connect with even more customers, we are making some changes in our sales team that affect a small number of roles," an Apple spokesperson tells Bloomberg. "We are continuing to hire, and those employees can apply for new roles." One of the hardest-hit teams worked with the US Defense and Justice Departments, Bloomberg reports. They were already facing a tough time with the recent government shutdown and the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) spending cutbacks before that. Several weeks ago, the iPhone maker also cut 20 sales jobs in Australia and New Zealand. Sources tell Bloomberg that some of the laid-off workers claim the company is just trying to offload its sales responsibilities to third-party resellers. Meanwhile, multiple tech behemoths have announced mass layoffs lately. Verizon laid off over 13,000 workers last week; Amazon confirmed 14,000 job cuts late last month; and Intel announced plans to reduce its headcount by 15% in June.

Title: Nvidia Shares Fall Sharply Amid Talks Of Meta Mulling Use Of Google Chips
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/nvidia-share-price-movement-amid-talks-of-meta-mulling-use-of-google-chips
Time Published: 2025-11-25T15:07:42Z
Full Content:
Shares of Nvidia Corp. plunged nearly 7% during early trade on Tuesday following reports that Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is considering using chips designed by Google. The slide put the stock on track for its biggest monthly decline since the market rout of 2022. The share price has fallen about 15% month to date. Google-parent Alphabet Inc. gained as much as 2.6% higher, after a more than 6% rally on Monday. The Information reported that Meta is considering using Google's tensor processing units (TPUs) in its data centers in 2027. Meta may also rent TPUs from Google's cloud unit next year, the publication reported. Google launched its first-generation TPU in 2018 and it was initially designed for its own internal use for its cloud computing business. Since then, Google has launched more advanced versions of its chip that are designed to handle artificial intelligence workloads. The company released its 7th generation TPU, Ironwood, this month. A Google-Meta deal would help establish TPUs as an alternative to Nvidia's chips, the gold standard for big tech firms and startups from Meta to OpenAI that need computing power to develop and run artificial intelligence platforms. Graphics processing units (GPUs), dominated by Nvidia, were initially designed to accelerate graphics rendering, particularly for video games and visual effects. However, their ability to handle large data sets and computations made them ideal for training AI models. In contrast, TPUs are specialised microchips, known as application-specific integrated circuits, designed specifically for a particular purpose. Last month, Google signed a deal with Anthropic PBC to supply up to 1 million of its specialised AI chips in a deal worth tens of billions of dollars. Meta's capex of at least $100 billion for 2026 suggests it will spend at least $40-$50 billion on inferencing-chip capacity next year, as per a Bloomberg report.

Title: Can artificial Christmas tree companies spruce things up for next year?

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. No one wants to put tariffs on Christmas, says the National Tree Company CEO. But what happens when all of your raw materials are made outside of the U.S.? If you celebrate Christmas, there’s a good chance you are putting up a tree this year. There’s also a high probability that you are rockin’ around a fake tree. Convenience, safety, durability and cost-effectiveness contribute to 83% of households selecting an artificial tree for the season, according to the American Christmas Tree Association. And the U.S., as it turns out, has a much heavier artificial tree representation than most of the world. “About 15 to 20 million are bought every single year,” National Tree Company CEO Chris Butler said. “It’s a huge industry.” This segment of the holiday market has been impacted by a year of roller coaster tariffs, retail pullback and an uncertain consumer base. “When the tariffs came out, no one was thinking about, ‘Let’s put tariffs on Christmas,’” Butler said. But, as he points out, “Zero percent of our industry is made in the U.S.” Holiday-focused companies are responding by moving production to different countries, implementing price changes, conducting promotions when possible and advocating to the government. Not just for 2025, but for Christmas seasons yet to come. The National Tree Company knows trees. Specifically, artificial ones. As one of the largest domestic wholesalers of the product, shoppers can buy directly from the company’s website, but also through large retailers including Walmart, Home Depot, Amazon, Macy’s and Lowe’s. As far as artificial tree consumption goes, the U.S. sports an average of one and a half trees per household, with the average purchase cycle being between five and six years. And all of the raw materials to make those trees come from China. The National Tree Company started to move its production out of China about 18 months ago for diversity and flexibility of its supply chain. The company currently sources from parts of Southeast Asia, including Cambodia and Vietnam, resulting in around 60% of its goods coming from outside of China this year. “When the tariffs came out, no one was thinking about ‘Let’s put tariffs on Christmas.’” Chris Butler CEO, National Tree Company So when tariffs were announced this spring, the company was expecting it, but they weren’t expecting the tariffs to be so heavy on countries other than China. “It was a bit of a shock to the system all the way around, because we were looking at 50% tariffs across the board, pretty much going from zero,” Butler said. When tariffs on China reached 145% this spring, almost all artificial tree production across this segment of the industry stopped for about 30 days. When levies on China were reduced, production started up again, but at a lower rate, Butler said. Additionally, many companies started building their supply chain sites outside of China at the same time. “It’s not difficult to set up a new factory in different countries, but once you do that, you still need the raw materials from China,” Butler said. “There was a slowing down of the supply chain this year, and hence why we think there’ll be somewhat of a shortage of supply.” The National Tree Company was able to be flexible when tariffs went back to 30%, in part because the business had been steadily investing in its supply chain systems. Even still, it was “100% by far the most challenging year ever,” Butler said. There may be better news going into 2026, however, when it comes to supply chains and tariffs. “I think it will start to stabilize,” Lauren Beitelspacher, professor of marketing at Babson College, said in emailed comments. Yet, “retail is always fraught with disruption,” Beitelspacher said. “The ups and downs are normal.” The big unknown for specialty retailers and big-box stores alike this year has been consumer sentiment. Tariffs, inflation, layoffs and a sudden suspension of SNAP funding have all contributed to an unsteady foundation for many holiday shoppers. Stores weren’t exactly sure how to gauge inventory for the season. Over half of holiday orders were placed by the end of May, about two months earlier when compared to 2024, according to Deloitte’s 2025 Retail Holiday Buyer Survey. Retail buyers paused shipments of some orders due to the trade environment or even canceled orders they determined would be unprofitable. The National Tree Company saw retailers “fall back somewhat because they were unsure of the consumer demand and consumer sentiment for this holiday season,” Butler said. Holiday shortages loomed over this Christmas season even as early as July, according to the American Christmas Tree Association. A 90-day reprieve in tariffs during the summer didn’t solve problems, according to the nonprofit group, because most Christmas decor items, including trees, lights, ornaments and garlands, are manufactured overseas with long production lead times. Now that retailers are in the throes of the season, some shoppers are pulling back on purchasing those exact items. Nearly 30% of people in the U.S. are decreasing their decorating budgets this year, according to a survey from Rocket Mortgage and Redfin. More than half (56%) of the segment that is pulling back say it is because they are trying to save money, while 44% named economic uncertainty as the reason behind the change. But there are still deals out there to be had. “If you’re in the market for a tree, buy now, buy early, buy multiple,” Butler said. “Despite the price increase from the tariffs, there are absolutely going to be deals. Because us — as well as everybody else — is seeing softness in demand. So there’s definitely going to be deals.” Butler also leads the Christmas Trade Group, a 10-member organization that collectively brings in over $1 billion annually and represents over 1,000 employees. He recently was in Washington, D.C., meeting with the Senate Finance Committee as a way to provide education on their businesses and garner insights into tariffs going forward. “2025 is done,” Butler said. “So what we’re trying to do is ‘save Christmas’ for 2026. Both from a supply chain perspective, in terms of securing supply in the right areas, as well as from a cost perspective, to keep the costs lower.” “We want to maintain the affordability of the holiday,” he said.

Title: Novo Nordisk phase 2 trial with amycretin reports significant weight loss and HbA1c reduction in type 2 diabetes

November 25, 2025 06:24 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 25 November 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced positive headline results from a phase 2 clinical trial with amycretin in people with type 2 diabetes. This marks the first evaluation of amycretin in people with type 2 diabetes, further demonstrating Novo Nordisk’s commitment to advancing innovation in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Amycretin is a unimolecular agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and amylin receptors, intended for once-weekly subcutaneous administration and once-daily oral administration. The trial investigated the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly subcutaneous amycretin and once-daily oral amycretin compared to placebo in 448 people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin with or without an SGLT2 inhibitor as standard of care. Approximately 40% of all participants were using an SGLT2 inhibitor before initiating the trial. The trial was a combined multiple ascending dose study, investigating six subcutaneous doses from 0.4 mg to 40 mg administered weekly, and three daily oral doses of 6 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg, with a total treatment duration of up to 36 weeks. When evaluating the effects of treatment, if all people adhered to treatment1 from a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.8%, once-weekly subcutaneous amycretin achieved dose-dependent reductions in HbA1c of up to -1.8% by week 36. The proportion of people achieving HbA1c <7% and ≤6.5% was up to 89.1% and 76.2% respectively. From a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.0%, people treated with once-daily oral amycretin achieved dose-dependent improvements in HbA1c of up to -1.5% by week 36. The proportion of people achieving an HbA1c level of <7% and ≤6.5% with once-daily oral amycretin was 77.6% and 62.6% respectively. By comparison, people treated with placebo achieved HbA1c improvement of -0.2% and -0.4% with subcutaneous and oral amycretin, respectively. The estimated improvements in HbA1c were all statistically significant versus placebo, confirming the primary endpoints of the trial. From a mean baseline body weight of 99.2 kg, subcutaneous amycretin achieved statistically significant weight loss of up to -14.5% compared to -2.6% in people treated with placebo. People treated with the highest dose of subcutaneous amycretin were on the final maintenance dose for a duration of 4 weeks. Similarly, from a mean baseline body weight of 101.1 kg, people treated with oral amycretin also achieved statistically significant weight loss of up to -10.1% compared to -2.5% in people treated with placebo. For the higher doses of amycretin, irrespective of administration route, no weight loss plateau was observed at week 36. In the trial, subcutaneous and oral amycretin appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile, consistent with other incretin and amylin-based therapies. The most common adverse events with amycretin were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate in severity. “We are very encouraged by the phase 2 data with amycretin in people with type 2 diabetes - the first time amycretin has been evaluated in this population. The data further validate the potential best-in-class profile of amycretin” said Martin Holst Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of Research and Development at Novo Nordisk. “Amycretin is built on the complementary biology of GLP-1 and amylin, and we are looking forward to bringing amycretin into an extensive phase 3 development programme across multiple indications in 2026”. Based on the results, Novo Nordisk is now planning to initiate a phase 3 development programme with amycretin for adults with type 2 diabetes in 2026. About amycretinAmycretin is a unimolecular, long-acting GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist under development by Novo Nordisk to provide an efficacious and convenient treatment for adults with overweight or obesity and as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes. Amycretin is developed for oral and subcutaneous administration. About the Phase 2 trial in T2DThis trial is an interventional, multinational, multi-centre, randomised, parallel, double-blind (within arms), placebo-controlled, dose-finding study. The phase 2 trial investigated the safety, efficacy and PK properties of once-weekly subcutaneous and once-daily oral amycretin in participants with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled (HbA1c 7.0-10.0 %) on a stable dose of metformin with or without an SGLT2 inhibitor. In the trial, close to two-thirds of the participants were male across both routes of administration. The trial consisted of nine active treatment arms. Participants received increasing doses of once-weekly subcutaneous amycretin (0.4 mg, 1.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg) in six groups, and oral amycretin (6 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg) in three groups for up to 36 weeks. The primary objective is to determine and characterise the dose-response relationship of subcutaneous and oral amycretin on change in HbA1c from baseline to week 36 in participants with type 2 diabetes. Secondary endpoints included changes in body weight (%) from baseline to week 36. About Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark. Our purpose is to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases, built upon our heritage in diabetes.

Title: Amazon CTO Werner Vogels just released his 2026 tech predictions. He’s most optimistic about ‘personalized learning’ and ‘renaissance developers’

Good morning. Several years ago, Amazon CTO Werner Vogels began sharing predictions on how technology would likely impact our lives the following year. In the past, he has foreseen the impact of digital technology in sports, AI assistants in developer productivity, machine learning embedded in production lines, and ‘fem tech’ in women’s health. As CTO since 2005, he occupies a unique perch to see—and even shape—what’s next. He also has a vested interest, of course, in embracing the technologies that his company creates. But these predictions are worth taking note of as these trends—if they materialize—will affect wide swaths of the economy. So what’s he forecasting for 2026? I spoke with Vogels about the thinking behind this year’s predictions. Among other things, he admits that technology tools from AI to military drones can obviously harm or help, depending on the intention of the user. But he’s an optimist, especially about the potential for personalized learning and software developers. And how does he see the mission of the CTO—a role that can cover everything from being the person who manages data centers to the founder focused on product? “I actually think CTOs are horrible managers. You should never put a CTO in charge of people,” he argues. “VPs of engineering wake up in the morning, thinking ‘Do I have the best team in the best situation? Can I shield them from politics and stuff like that?’ The CTO thinks about, ‘What’s the next technology that we should be building?’ Actually, that was my role for many years within Amazon. Then you become a technology provider, and then your role changes again. You have to understand how your customers are actually using your technology.” As for what excites him most: “Especially in Africa, I’ve met so many motivated engineers that don’t want to come to the U.S. They don’t want to go work for a large company. They want to solve the problem in their country. I love that. That’s where the real progress lies.” Click here for our full interview.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Google challenges Nvidia’s chips Shares of Nvidia dropped following a report that Meta is in talks to buy billions worth of AI chips from Google, suggesting the search engine company’s chips are ready to compete with Nvidia’s bestselling versions.

VWs, made in China Volkswagen said Tuesday that it can for the first time make new electric vehicles entirely in China and do so for half the cost of making them in its native Germany. VW has invested billions in localized R&D in China and plans to introduce about 30 EVs there in the next five years. Tim Cook’s possible successors Since Apple CEO Tim Cook turned 65 recently , speculation has intensified about his possible successors. John Ternus, Craig Federighi, Eddy Cue and Greg ‘Joz’ Joswiak are all reportedly in the running and oversee different parts of the company. The Big Short investor compares Nvidia with Cisco The Big Short investor Michael Burry wrote in his first Substack post that Nvidia is the equivalent of Cisco during the dot com bubble: significantly overvalued and a harbinger for when the AI bubble will pop. Novo Nordisk’s slump continues U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk fell more than 5% on Monday, largely due to the drug developer’s announcement that semaglutide, the core ingredient in its Ozempic and Wegovy drugs, did not slow cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer’s patients. The company has lost almost half of its value since the year started. Is robot-driven unemployment already here? Amazon cut 14,000 jobs in October, and multiple sources now predict another round of layoffs in early 2026 as the company doubles down on AI and robotics. Both blue-collar and white-collar employees are growing anxious about who might be next—and what the future looks like if there aren’t enough jobs left for humans.

Title: India shouldn’t build AI models: The prize lies in using what exists to innovate and generate value

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Earlier this year, Amazon announced that it was eliminating 14,000 management positions because artificial intelligence (AI) tools had rendered those middle-management roles redundant. Amazon isn’t the only one—Microsoft, Google and IBM have all announced AI-related layoffs. According to a 2023 report by Niti Aayog, 1.5 million Indian jobs in the IT and business process outsourcing (BPO) sectors alone are expected to be at high risk by 2031. McKinsey believes that as many as 69% of tasks in India’s IT services industry can already be automated with existing AI technology, suggesting that as many as 3-4 million jobs in the IT and BPO sectors could be at risk in the near to medium term. Our instinctive response has been to try to catch up—to build AI capabilities so that we can replace the jobs being lost by upskilling displaced workers with the technology that displaced them. We have announced AI education initiatives, established new AI research centres and funded GPU clusters and data centres that we believe these newly trained engineers will be able to use for building AI applications. But this strategy is unlikely to be effective. Firstly, India will not be able to bridge the skills gap by simply retraining its existing workforce. Unlike the IT industry, which has a broad base, AI has an inverted pyramid and is staffed in exactly the opposite way that a BPO centre is staffed. As a result, even if we manage to reskill all those in the traditional IT industry, only a small fraction of those reskilled IT workers will be needed going forward. What’s more, unlike the US, which boasts of 30 years of AI research infrastructure and top universities that attract global talent, and China, which is investing billions in AI research and already has a massive pool of strong STEM graduates, India currently produces fewer than 500 AI PhDs annually. Even if we increase this 10-fold, we will still be playing catch-up in a field where first-mover advantages matter enormously. The trouble with competing in the race to build better AI models is that it requires us to compete upstream in the AI value chain in a market already crowded by players with significantly more capital and hardware infrastructure, which places them ahead in the game. As noble as it might seem for us to fight the good fight, there are other areas in which Indian investments in time and resources are likely to yield better results. When the automobile disrupted traditional urban mobility and transport dynamics, the real opportunity was not in making cars, but in the novel ways in which they could be used for business and the new liberties that arose from being able to use these machines for things that were not possible earlier. When Apple invented the smartphone, it did not just create a revolutionary communication device, but also made it possible for brand new businesses (such as ride-hailing, food delivery and digital payments) to emerge. Every technological transformation creates ripples of opportunity downstream that offer new avenues for entrepreneurship. This suggests that the AI opportunity lies not in competing with big AI labs to build better models, but rather in discovering all the various ways in which AI can be deployed to create value. This, in turn, suggests that instead of competing with countries that are at the cutting edge of developing new foundational AI models, India may be far better off figuring out how to use AI to do things that would not have been possible previously. One of the clearest signs of this downstream potential is how dramatically AI has already lowered barriers to creative endeavours. Already, to write a story or create an image, a musical composition or a software feature, all you need to do is describe what you want and AI will execute it. Even just a few years ago, filmmaking required large crews, expensive equipment and a budget that ran into millions. AI has made it possible to create visual effects, voice actors and music scores, with film editing done and other technical skills deployed at a fraction of that cost. Similarly, music production used to require studio recording, mixing and mastering skills. Today, with AI, almost anyone can generate a score, create vocal effects and mix tracks. Just as the world saw in the case of every other technological transformation that created new jobs and industries downstream of the actual disruption it caused, AI too will birth business opportunities that are not even conceivable today. If we really want to address the disruptions that AI will cause in the job market, we should focus our energies on enabling as many of our people as possible to figure out how to use AI and do all we can to make it possible for our young entrepreneurs to leverage this new technology in as many new and interesting ways as they can imagine. The next three to five years will be a period of intense experimentation, when AI-assisted business models will be tested, refined and scaled. India’s entrepreneurs have a rare early-mover advantage—not in building the models themselves, but in discovering what those models make possible. If we invest our energy downstream, in imagining the new possibilities that are opening up, we will be able to harness the real opportunity that AI offers. Our best response to the AI revolution is not to build better intelligence, but discover the many ways in which it can be put to use. India needs to make the most of this opportunity.

Title: Nvidia CEO told employees to use AI for 'every task that is possible' and says there will still be plenty of jobs

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants employees to use AI whenever they can — and he insists they shouldn't worry about losing their jobs in the process. In an all-hands meeting on Thursday, the day after the chipmaker reported record earnings, Huang responded to a question about managers instructing employees to use AI less. "My understanding is Nvidia has some managers who are telling their people to use less AI," he said at the meeting, which Business Insider listened to. "Are you insane?" Huang said he strongly disapproved. "I want every task that is possible to be automated with artificial intelligence to be automated with artificial intelligence," he said. "I promise you, you will have work to do." Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Nvidia isn't alone, as tech giants have taken measures to push employees to incorporate more AI into their day-to-day work. Both Microsoft and Meta plan to evaluate employees based on their AI usage, and Google told engineers to use AI for coding, Business Insider reported. Amazon was in talks to adopt the AI coding assistant Cursor after employees requested it, according to Business Insider's reporting. Huang also said Nvidia's software engineers use Cursor. And if AI does not work for a specific task, "use it until it does," he added. "Jump in and help make it better, because we have the power to do so." Though fear of job loss has been a constant drumbeat amid the rise of AI, Huang suggested Nvidia employees shouldn't worry. He said that while other tech companies have conducted layoffs, Nvidia had hired "several thousand" people last quarter, which he joked was putting a strain on office parking spaces. He added that hiring is still ramping up. "Frankly, I think we're probably still about 10,000 short," Huang said, "but the pace at which we hire should be consistent with the pace at which we can integrate and harmonize the new employees." Nvidia has significantly expanded its workforce, increasing from 29,600 employees at the end of fiscal 2024 to 36,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2025. As Nvidia grows, its physical footprint is expanding. Huang said at the meeting that the company has recently moved into new offices in Taipei and Shanghai and is constructing two additional sites in the US. Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of over $4 trillion. The company reported last Wednesday that it generated $57.01 billion in revenue in the last quarter, up 62% from the same period last year. Recently, investor Michael Burry of "The Big Short" has been taking aim at Nvidia, voicing skepticism about the AI boom. Nvidia pushed back on these criticisms in a memo to Wall Street analysts, Business Insider reported Monday. Have a tip?

November 25, 2025 05:00 ET | Source: Jiayin Group Inc. Jiayin Group Inc. SHANGHAI, China, Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jiayin Group Inc. (“Jiayin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: JFIN), a leading fintech platform in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025. Third Quarter 2025 Operational and Financial Highlights: _______________________1 “Loan facilitation volume” refers to the loan facilitation volume facilitated in Chinese Mainland during the period presented.2 “Repeat borrower contribution” for a given period refers to the percentage of loan facilitation volume in Chinese Mainland attributable to repeat borrowers during that period.“Repeat borrowers” during a certain period refers to borrowers who have borrowed in such period and have borrowed at least twice since such borrowers’ registration on our platform until the end of such period.3 “90 day+ delinquency ratio” refers to the outstanding principal balance of loans that were 91 to 180 calendar days past due as a percentage of the total outstanding principal balance of loans facilitated through the Company’s platform as of a specific date. Loans facilitated outside Chinese Mainland are not included in the calculation.4 Please see the section entitled “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure” below and the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release. Mr. Yan Dinggui, the Company’s Founder, Director and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “In the third quarter, we anchored our strategic focus on fortifying operational resilience and advancing prudent risk management. Despite the uncertainty in the macro environment, we reached our previously stated guidance of RMB32.2 billion in loan facilitation volume and RMB490.6 million in Non-GAAP income from operation. We have actively engaged with our financial institution partners to adapt to regulatory changes, while advancing our AI technologies and refining operational work flows, collectively elevating the quality and efficiency of our facilitation services. These efforts lay a robust foundation for sustainable growth. Looking ahead, we remain committed to further consolidating our competitive edge in core domains, ensuring the Company stays at the vanguard of fintech innovation while delivering enduring, stakeholder-centric value.” Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results Net revenue was RMB1,470.2 million (US$206.5 million), representing an increase of 1.8% from the same period of 2024. Revenue from loan facilitation services was RMB1,220.7 million (US$171.5 million), representing an increase of 10.4% from the same period of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to higher loan facilitation volume, partially offset by service fee adjustments. Revenue from releasing of guarantee liabilities was RMB151.8 million (US$21.3 million) compared with RMB251.7 million in the same period of 2024. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the decrease in average outstanding loan balances for which the Company provided guarantee services. Other revenue was RMB97.7 million (US$13.7 million), compared with RMB87.5 million for the same period of 2024. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the contribution from referral fees. Facilitation and servicing expense was RMB286.5 million (US$40.2 million) compared with RMB419.1 million for the same period of 2024. This was primarily due to decreased expenses related to financial guarantee services. Allowance for uncollectible receivables, contract assets, loans receivable and others was RMB1.5 million (US$0.2 million), representing a decrease of 87.1% from the same period of 2024, primarily due to decreased allowance for oversea loans as a result of disposal of Nigeria entities during 2024 and growth slowdown of receivables from loan facilitation business. Sales and marketing expense was RMB544.2 million (US$76.4 million), representing a decrease of 1.1% from the same period of 2024. General and administrative expense was RMB72.4 million (US$10.2 million), representing an increase of 29.0% from the same period of 2024, primarily driven by an increase in share-based compensation. Research and development expense was RMB108.7 million (US$15.3 million), representing an increase of 13.3% from the same period of 2024, primarily driven by an increase in expenditures for employee compensation and related benefits. Income from operation was RMB456.9 million (US$64.2 million), representing an increase of 46.5% from the same period of 2024. Non-GAAP income from operation was RMB490.6 million (US$68.9 million), compared with RMB326.5 million in the same period of 2024. Net income was RMB376.5 million (US$52.9 million), representing an increase of 39.7% from the same period of 2024. Basic and diluted net income per share were both RMB1.83 (US$0.26) compared with RMB1.27 in the third quarter of 2024. Basic and diluted net income per ADS were both RMB7.32 (US$1.04) compared with RMB5.08 in the third quarter of 2024. Each ADS represents four Class A ordinary shares of the Company. Cash and cash equivalents were RMB124.2 million (US$17.4 million) as of September 30, 2025, compared with RMB316.2 million as of June 30, 2025. The following chart and table display the historical cumulative M3+ Delinquency Rate by Vintage for loan products facilitated through the Company’s platform in Chinese Mainland. Business Outlook The Company expects its loan facilitation volume for the full year of 2025 to be in the range of RMB127.8 billion to RMB129.8 billion and its loan facilitation volume for the fourth quarter of 2025 to be in the range of RMB23.0 billion to RMB25.0 billion. The Company expects its non-GAAP income from operation for the full year of 2025 to be in the range of RMB1.99 billion to RMB2.06 billion.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure We use non-GAAP income from operation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, in evaluating our operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measure helps identify underlying trends in our business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses. We believe that non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information about our operating results, enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. Non-GAAP income from operation represents income from operation excluding share-based compensation expenses. Such adjustment has no impact on income tax. Non-GAAP income from operation is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as analytical tool, and when assessing our operating performance, cash flows or our liquidity, investors should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for income from operation, net income, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operation and cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. For more information on this non-GAAP financial measure, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP results” set forth at the end of this press release.

Δ The latest installment of PYMNTS Intelligence’s “New Reality Check: The Paycheck-to-Paycheck Report” series, breaks down how consumers earn income. The study is based on a census-balanced survey of 2,117 U.S. adult consumers, 62% are employed. Among those workers, 43% say their primary source of income is an hourly wage, and another 15% say it is from other non-salaried pay models such as gig work or contract fees. Gen Z workers especially are working outside of fixed-salary roles. Nearly 3 in 4 get their income in other ways, with 51% earning hourly wages, 9% earning contract or consulting fees, 7% earning income from gig or platform work and 5% earning commission-based pay. More Americans are relying on part-time jobs to make ends meet. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of employees working full-time dropped by 0.5%, or 695,000 people, between 2023 and 2024. The number of part-time workers jumped 3.7%, or just over 1 million people, during the same period. Relatedly, the rise in gig work can be seen in the expansion of major platforms catering to independent contractors and freelancers. In the third quarter of 2025, Uber said it had 9.4 million drivers, up from 7.8 million the year before and 7.4 million in the second quarter of last year. DoorDash grew total orders by 21% year over year in Q3 to 776 million. Lyft reported record-high gross bookings of $4.8 billion in the third quarter, a 16% year-on-year spike. Even companies outside the dedicated gig platform space, such as UPS, are using the gig model. But as more consumers rely on hourly, project-based and gig work to make ends meet, rather than the stability of a fixed salary, they may find it harder to weather an uncertain economic environment. Because of the Trump administration’s global “reciprocal” tariffs regime, Americans face the highest import levies in 90 years. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Recent PYMNTS data shows confidence slipping, especially among lower-income workers. JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon, often described as a pessimist, sees the threat of a U.S. recession continuing to loom as the new year approaches. Two-thirds of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, including 42% who see their money fly out the door the month it comes in, an 18% jump since August. It is not as if these workers can simply leave their jobs for more steady, reliable work, with the number of job openings unchanged at 7.2 million in August. What’s more, many of the skilled jobs that often come with fixed salaries are shrinking. While economists are sharply divided over the degree to which artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate jobs, some recent research suggests that white collar roles — those traditional salaried positions — will be most impacted. While some businesses tout how AI will enable them to introduce operational efficiencies and reduce their workforces, companies also downsize for reasons not related to the technology. October saw a 175% year-over-year increase in layoffs, with Amazon planning to eliminate 30,000 corporate jobs and Target slashing its corporate roles by 1,800. Workers have been nervous about these reductions for some time. A PYMNTS Intelligence survey last year found that 58% of consumers believed generative AI posed a risk to high-skilled jobs in tech. More than half deemed it a risk to mainstream office-based occupations, and 52% said it jeopardized roles for qualified education workers. As go changes in the labor market, so go spending and consumption patterns, deepening the connection between income instability and personal financial well-being.

Unprecedented stress is hitting the US labor market for college graduates, who now represent a record 25.3% of the unemployed. Recent data shows over 1.9 million degree holders are jobless, with their unemployment rate climbing to 2.8%. This surge, particularly impacting younger workers, signals a significant slowdown in white-collar hiring, potentially driven by AI and automation.

Law firms that have long advised private equity giants on mergers and acquisitions are joining the industry’s latest treasure hunt: prying open America’s 401(k)s. November 24, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Big Law made one fortune helping private equity lure large investors. Now it’s minting another helping the industry attract small ones. Law firms that have long advised private equity giants on mergers and acquisitions — and often bill more than $1,000 an hour for their services — are joining the industry’s latest treasure hunt: prying open America’s 401(k)s. The lawyers’ lucrative, if unglamorous, task: setting up funds that promise to bring private equity’s rarefied style of investing to everyday people, even as some big institutions pull back from these investments. For the financial-industrial complex — bankers, asset managers, lawyers, financial advisors, record-keepers — the incentive is obvious. All told, nearly $13 trillion is sitting in 401(k) accounts and other defined-contribution retirement plans. Tapping into that trove could help plug gaps left by deep-pocketed pensions and endowments. “More and more people are realizing there’s a lot of money in this,” said Phil Troyer, of counsel at Endeavor Law in Overland Park, Kansas, who specializes in compliance in the retirement-plan industry. Financial advisors say average investors should tread carefully when weighing whether to add private assets to their retirement mix. There’s no guarantee future investment returns will justify the industry’s high fees. Related:DOL Drops Legal Defense of Biden Fiduciary Rule Lawyers, however, can bill today. Legal fees for the structuring and paperwork of a simple private-markets fund for retail investors can sometimes be as much as $1.5 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Ongoing legal work can amount to hundreds of thousands a year. Wall Street lawyers say they’ve never seen anything quite like this. Fund specialists — who once set up far less lucrative mutual funds and exchange-traded funds and were snubbed by some of the big firms — are now so coveted that pay can stretch into seven digits, people close to the firms say. Ho-hum legal work like going through fund regulations and preparing prospectuses suddenly looks like a growth business. And so big-name law firms like Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and Kirkland & Ellis are stepping up and looking for talent in an area that, until recently, was far from being a priority. They’re helping the likes of Apollo Global Management Inc., Blackstone Inc. and KKR & Co. set up funds aimed at retail investors. A lawyer at one prominent firm said he recently received 25 inquiries in a single week from private-markets firms looking to get into the 401(k) market. Related:J.P. Morgan Wealth Head at Center of Senator’s Epstein Inquiry Private equity players and their lawyers have been laying the groundwork for this moment for years. Since 2020, the number of semi-liquid private-market funds — which allow periodic cash redemptions — aimed at retail and private-wealth investors has doubled, to roughly 380, according to Preqin. Now, the push is accelerating after President Donald Trump gave the industry a green light to go after the 401(k) market. This year, Apollo, Ares Management Corp., Blackstone, Blue Owl Capital Inc., Brookfield Asset Management, Neuberger Berman and Partners Group all announced new funds for the masses. More are on the way. Simpson Thacher, which advised KKR on its famous 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco, has done legal work on more than 50 funds since it started building a retail team in 2014, according to people familiar with the matter, including for Blackstone, Apollo, KKR and TPG Inc. The law firm advised on a new partnership between Blackstone, Vanguard Group — the great popularizer of low-cost index funds — and Vanguard’s longtime partner Wellington Management Co., and a similar tie-up with Capital Group and KKR to bring private-market funds to the masses. To handle the new business, law firms have been shelling out for legal talent. In the past decade, Simpson Thacher has expanded its team for retail funds from a handful of people to include 21 partners and 125 lawyers. Related:Florida Advisor Pleads Guilty to $94M Scheme Targeting Venezuelans Kirkland & Ellis has expanded its unit to about 60 people from fewer than five a half-decade ago and advises at least 60 clients on their retail funds, according to people familiar with the matter. Recent clients include Ares’ Strategic Income Fund and Neuberger Berman’s Private Markets Access Fund. In July it said it’s advising Blue Owl on a strategic partnership with retirement, employee benefits and investment management firm Voya Financial Inc. to develop private-markets products for defined-contribution retirement plans. Two other white-shoe law firms, Davis Polk & Wardwell and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, have been hiring in this area, too. Rajib Chanda, the partner who set up the Simpson Thacher’s retail practice, Kirkland & Ellis partner Erica Berthou and Cleary Gottlieb partner Jeff Karpf each said their firms are following client demand. Davis Polk didn’t respond to requests for comment. Loukia Gyftopoulou You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Copyright © 2025 Informa Connect Limited.

The gloom that has hung over Wall Street in recent weeks showed signs of dissipating on Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up about 2.4% in recent trading, leading the major indexes higher after lagging during Friday’s rally. Big tech shares and many of Wall Street’s favorite AI stocks were among Monday’s top gainers, with chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) and Micron (MU) each up more than 7% and all of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the green. Dip-buying retail investors may be partly responsible. Money poured into S&P 500 exchange-traded funds last week while the index slumped, according to a UBS note, while ETF inflows as a percent of assets under management climbed to their highest level this year—both signs, the analysts wrote, of individual-investor optimism. And inflows into leveraged funds accelerated throughout the sell-off, according to Deutsche Bank analysts, another potential sign of retail's confidence. There are signs of improving investor sentiment, particularly among retail investors, heading into the Thanksgiving holiday. Retail investor behavior often reflects market sentiment, or vibes, as they usually lack the detailed market data and sophisticated algorithms of institutional investors. Sentiment is itself one of the main drivers of stock market returns. Stocks sold off last week as concerns about an AI bubble and uncertainty about the trajectory of monetary policy weighed on sentiment. The S&P 500 lost nearly 2% and the Nasdaq dropped 2.7%. Equity positioning turned underweight—indicating caution—for the first time since July, according to Deutsche Bank. Chief among investors’ concerns was whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month. Signs of a weakening labor market argue for a cut, while evidence that inflation is accelerating well above the Fed's 2% target could drive caution. Rate-cut expectations jumped all over the place last week. The September jobs report—the last piece of official labor market data policymakers are likely to see before they meet—sent mixed signals, causing expectations to plummet. But they rebounded Friday when one Fed official indicated he was open to cutting. As of Monday, market participants put the odds of a December rate cut at about 77%, up from just 30% last Wednesday. Investors are also debating whether the AI boom that’s fueled the bull market is a perilous bubble. A stronger-than-expected earnings report from chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) last week wasn’t enough to put those fears to bed. AI stocks continued to slump following the report, and many missed out on Friday’s rally entirely. Calm returned to markets Monday. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's “Fear Index,” recently stood at about 21, a tick above the level associated with smooth sailing for stocks. And CNN’s Fear & Greed index, which tracks seven market metrics to gauge the prevailing sentiment among investors, looked less scary after notching its most pessimistic reading since early April. Last week's AAII Sentiment Survey of individual investors, meanwhile, also showed a slightly more optimistic outlook than seen a week earlier, when nearly half of respondents were bearish. Economic data this week could test that calm. Investors will be watching jobless claims data on Wednesday for a clearer picture of the state of the job market. And the Producer Price Index for September, due Tuesday, should fill out the Fed's picture of inflation; it's likely to be the last inflation data released before the Fed makes its rate decision.

Major U.S. equities indexes climbed Monday afternoon as tech stocks rallied, and as optimism about a rate cut by the Federal Reserve next month grew. The Dow rose 0.4% and the S&P 500 added 1.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq surged over 2%. Tesla's (TSLA) stock popped 7%, making it one of the top performers in the S&P 500 Monday after CEO Elon Musk posted on social media over the weekend that the company plans to build more AI chips than all others combined. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) jumped over 5% to an all-time high, extending their recent gains amid excitement about the tech giant’s Gemini 3 AI model launched last week. Centene (CNC), Elevance Health (ELV), and Molina Healthcare (MOH) shares all rose following reports President Trump would back a health care proposal extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. Carvana (CVNA) shares surged nearly 7% following an upgrade to "outperform" from "neutral" by analysts at Wedbush, who called the vehicle retailer the “new used car king.” Novo Nordisk (NVO) sank after the drugmaker said its latest drug trial was not effective in slowing the progression of Alzheimer's. Performance Food Group (PFGC) shares dropped as the food distributor and rival US Foods (USFD) agreed to call off merger talks. Shares of US Foods were higher. Gold prices ticked higher, and crude oil futures slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged lower to 4.05%. The U.S. dollar was up on the pound and yen, but lost ground to the euro. Most major cryptocurrencies traded lower.

Title: Low Fat Cheese Market to Worth Over US$ 160.1 Billion by 2033 | Astute Analytica

Time Published: 2025-11-24T13:30:00Z
Full Content:
November 24, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global low fat cheese market was valued at US$ 121.6 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 160.1 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 3.1% from 2025–2033. Stakeholders in the low fat cheese market must recognize that vague health claims no longer satisfy consumers; specific nutrient density is the new currency. For instance, Babybel Light has set a strict calorie-controlled benchmark with exactly 50 calories per piece, while Sargento Reduced Fat Sharp Cheddar directly addresses lipid concerns by delivering just 5 grams of fat per serving. Concurrently, protein maximization is reshaping formulation strategies, evidenced by Arla Protein Lite Cheddar slices offering a substantial 20 grams of protein per serving. Similarly, Horizon Organic Lowfat Cottage Cheese provides a robust 14 grams of protein per half-cup serving. Arla’s innovation extends further, boasting 40% less fat than standard cheddar, proving that consumers demand high functionality without dietary compromise. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/low-fat-cheese-market Beyond macronutrients, sodium reduction has become a precise science within the low fat cheese market. Standard Swiss cheese naturally leads with a low 53 milligrams of sodium per ounce, setting a high bar for processed alternatives. In the cooking segment, Ricotta cheese averages 123 milligrams of sodium per half-cup serving, whereas newer low-salt white cheese formulations in 2024 have reached 400 milligrams of sodium per 30-gram serving. Manufacturers like Sargento are also fortifying these reduced-fat matrices with Vitamin A Palmitate to restore lost nutritional density. These meticulous specifications highlight a shift where every milligram counts in the consumer's decision-making process. Key Findings in Low Fat Cheese Market Global Production Capabilities are Shaping Supply Chain Availability Supply volume acts as the backbone of the growing low fat cheese market, with global cheese production forecast to reach a massive 22.55 million metric tons in the 2024/2025 marketing year. Within the United States, total cheese production was projected to hit 6.55 million metric tons in 2024, providing ample base material for nutritional modification. Specifically, Italian-type cheese production—critical for low-fat mozzarella variants—totaled 499 million pounds in August 2024 alone. Notably, US Mozzarella production accounts for 79.5% of the total Italian cheese category, significantly outpacing American-type cheese production, which totaled 478 million pounds in the same month. Regional production hubs in the low fat cheese market are adjusting their outputs to feed this global appetite. Australia's cheese production is projected to reach 435,000 metric tons in 2024, while New Zealand produced 400,000 tons in the 2023/2024 cycle to meet export needs. Domestically, US per capita cheese consumption reached nearly 42 pounds per person in the 2024 reporting cycle, signaling robust demand. Trends indicate that Mozzarella sticks will see the fastest segment growth through 2034, while Ricotta cheese held the largest product segment share in 2024. Such volume data confirms that the market is supported by a highly active global production network. Inventory Deficits Signal Tightening Conditions For Market Stakeholders Recent data suggests a tightening of supply that could increase urgency within the low fat cheese market. US natural cheese stocks in cold storage dropped by 33 million pounds in September 2024, a significant contraction relative to expectations. Furthermore, the US$A revised its August 2024 stock figures downward by 6.6 million pounds, compounding the deficit. American cheese stocks specifically fell by 29 million pounds in September 2024. These reductions imply that demand is outpacing immediate storage capabilities, creating potential pinch points for retailers seeking consistent inventory flow. However, contrasting inventory signals present a complex landscape for buyers. Total butter stocks exceeded forecasts by 7 million pounds in September 2024, creating a divergence between fat and protein commodities. Forward-looking projections for December 2024 showed a potential 19 million pound surplus in cheese stocks, suggesting relief may be on the horizon. In related protein sectors, pork bellies stocks dropped 25% in August 2024, while overall US natural cheese supplies ended August 2024 1% lower than the previous month. Stakeholders in the low fat cheese market must navigate these mixed inventory signals to optimize procurement strategies. Volatile Wholesale Costs are Directly Influencing Retail Margin Structures Fluctuations in raw material costs are currently dictating the profitability of the low fat cheese market. On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Cheddar block prices traded at US$ 1.79 per pound for the week ending November 15, 2025, showing distinct volatility compared to the US$ 1.50 per pound recorded in January 2024. Meanwhile, Cheddar barrel prices reached US$ 2.005 per pound in August 2024, creating an unusual dynamic where processing cheese cost more than blocks. The price gap between block and barrel cheese stood at 4.75 cents in August 2024, a metric that processors watch closely when calculating margins for shredded low-fat blends. International auctions reflect similarly high valuations for key ingredients. Global Cheddar cheese prices at the Global Dairy Trade auction averaged US$ 4,973 per metric ton in November 2024, while Mozzarella prices averaged US$ 4,607 per metric ton. Additionally, Dry whey prices—often used in protein fortification—averaged 62.6 cents per pound in November 2025. These input costs force manufacturers in the low fat cheese market to balance premium pricing with competitive value propositions. Rising wholesale indices suggest that cost containment will remain a primary challenge for the remainder of the fiscal year. Premium Retail Pricing Reflects Strong Demand For Healthy Variants Retailers are successfully maintaining premium price points, validating the value-add nature of the low fat cheese market. Horizon Organic Lowfat Cottage Cheese, for example, retails for US$ 6.49 per 16-ounce tub, positioning it as a high-tier option. In the snacking aisle, Babybel Reduced Fat commands approximately US$ 4.99 at major US retailers, while Knudsen Lowfat Cottage Cheese holds a similar price point of US$ 4.99 for a 16-ounce container. These consistent price floors indicate that health-conscious consumers are willing to absorb higher costs for perceived nutritional benefits. Convenience formats further enhance margin potential for retailers in the low fat cheese market. Sargento Balanced Breaks retail for US$ 4.99 per 3-pack unit, capitalizing on the intersection of health and portability. Similarly, Frigo Cheese Heads in the string cheese segment retail for US$ 6.49 for a 10-ounce pack. Even in the meal category, Amy’s Kitchen Light in Sodium Macaroni & Cheese retails for US$ 3.79 per 9-ounce package, while Organic Valley 2% Milk—a key input proxy—retails for US$ 5.99 per gallon. These figures confirm that the market supports robust pricing structures across diverse product categories. Expanding International Trade Volumes are Reshaping Export Demand Channels in Low Fat Cheese Market Export markets are absorbing a significant portion of production, acting as a vital release valve for the market. US cheese exports totaled 42,459 metric tons in August 2024 alone. Impressively, cumulative US cheese exports for the first eight months of 2024 reached roughly 60,146 metric tons above the previous year's baseline. Mexico remains a primary partner, with exports increasing by 2,256 metric tons in August 2024. Within that flow, exports of "Other Cheese"—a category often housing processed and low-fat blends—rose by 1,942 metric tons, highlighting specific demand for versatile formulations. Global appetite extends beyond North America low fat cheese market, influencing long-term trade forecasts. US cheese exports to the MENA region increased by 1,245 metric tons in August 2024. Looking ahead, Japan is forecast to import an additional 6,886 metric tons of US cheddar-type cheeses between 2025 and 2026, adding to a total import volume that exceeded 251,913 metric tons. However, shifts are evident; Cheddar exports to Japan fell by 1,742 metric tons in August 2024, suggesting a pivot toward other varieties. With total US cheese exports for 2024 forecast to hit a record 508,808 metric tons, international trade remains a pillar of the market. Major Market Players Face Intense Competition From Private Label The competitive landscape of the low fat cheese market is defined by a battle between legacy brands and store-brand dominance. Sargento Foods remains a powerhouse, reporting peak annual revenue of US$ 1.3 billion in 2024, with shredded unit sales recorded at 116 million units. However, Kraft continues to lead in volume, with shredded unit sales reaching 266 million units. Despite these massive branded numbers, Private Label shredded cheese—often the entry point for budget-conscious low-fat shoppers—achieved a staggering 1.25 billion unit sales, dwarfing individual branded competitors. Smaller segments show equally fierce positioning battles. Tillamook recorded 42 million unit sales in the natural cheese category, carving out a premium niche. In the shelf-stable arena, Sargento holds the position of the No. 8 seller, while Mondelēz International saw cheese unit sales of 13 million. These metrics illustrate that while brand equity drives revenue, volume in the low fat cheese market is heavily swayed by private label accessibility. Brands must therefore innovate relentlessly to justify their price premiums against generic alternatives. Looking for Country-Level or Section-Wise Data? Customize This Report: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/report-walkthrough/low-fat-cheese-market Product Innovations and Dietary Inclusivity Define Future Growth Vectors Innovation in 2024 has focused heavily on "permissible indulgence" and dietary inclusivity. Arla Foods launched a new line of organic low-fat cottage cheese in February 2024, catering to the clean-label demographic. Similarly, Saputo Inc. introduced LightLife Mozzarella Shreds for foodservice, while Horizon Organic introduced a new organic low-fat cheese product in April 2024. These launches underscore the industry's pivot toward functional, high-quality offerings that elevate the perception of the low fat cheese market. Europe’s market value of US$ 38.9 billion in 2024 further validates the scale of this opportunity. Beyond traditional dairy, allergen-free attributes are expanding the addressable market. Babybel Plant-Based contains 0 grams of lactose, appealing to those with sensitivities, while Bel Brands expanded its dairy-free distribution to major retailers like Costco in 2024. Ricotta cheese held the largest product segment share in 2024, driven by its versatility in healthy cooking. Furthermore, gluten-free and lactose-free claims were key drivers in Arla's 2024 product expansions. These diverse innovation vectors ensure that the low fat cheese market remains dynamic and relevant to evolving consumer lifestyles.

November 24, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: AINewsWire AINewsWire AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AINewsWire Editorial Coverage: Amid persistent inflation, cautious capital markets and uneven industry performance, investors are placing heightened importance on one metric above all: whether a company can deliver credible, measurable earnings improvement. This scrutiny is especially pronounced in fast-growing fields such as artificial intelligence and service robotics, where technological breakthroughs are plentiful but true financial execution is less common. That distinction helps explain why Nightfood Holdings Inc. (NGTF) (Profile) stands out following its most recent quarterly results, which reported an approximately $91.5 million increase in temporary equity. The gain stems from the company’s strategic hotel acquisitions, designed to accelerate deployment of its AI-driven robotics model. According to Nightfood, completing and converting these transactions is expected to materially strengthen the company’s balance sheet and support its progress toward uplisting, marking a significant milestone in its evolution into a data-centric hospitality automation platform. In doing so, the company is emerging as a leader at the intersection of hospitality, artificial intelligence and robotics, alongside other innovators in the AI and automation space, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), Pegasystems Inc. (NASDAQ: PEGA), Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM).

Automation Race Sharpens, Financial Performance Becomes True Differentiator As automation reshapes service industries worldwide, the hospitality market has become a real-time testing ground for AI-driven robotics. With wages rising, staffing shortages persisting and hotels requiring 24/7 operational consistency, demand for automated systems capable of handling guest services, logistics and routine workflows continues to climb. Independent analysts point to accelerating adoption. Grand View Research projects the global service robotics sector to expand from roughly $47 billion in 2023 to about $107.8 billion by 2030, propelled by increased uptake in hospitality, logistics, healthcare and retail. For hotel operators, AI-enhanced automation has quickly shifted from “emerging technology” to competitive requirement. Robots are being deployed for food and beverage delivery, restocking, housekeeping support and customer interaction. One industry survey found that 78% of hotel leaders expect to increase technology spending over the next three years, highlighting the sector’s push toward workflow automation, digital guest services and AI-enabled efficiency. These investments are motivated by more than operational convenience. Research indicates that companies integrating robotics into labor-intensive processes can achieve 20–30% cost reductions, especially in repetitive and high-turnover functions. Yet financial markets remain wary of automation firms that lack measurable traction. Despite impressive engineering, many robotics companies remain in pilot phases or prerevenue. In contrast, a smaller set of innovators is beginning to demonstrate tangible balance sheet improvement, recurring revenue opportunities and scaling capability. In today’s macroeconomic climate, quarterly financial performance serves as a vital indicator of credibility and separates viable automation platforms from unproven concepts. Strategic Acquisitions Drive $91.5M Equity Improvement Nightfood reported an estimated $91.5 million improvement in temporary equity for the quarter ending September 30, 2025. This momentum can be directly tied to two major hotel portfolio acquisitions that the company views as foundational infrastructure for its AI-driven Robots-as-a-Service (RaaS) strategy. On September 18, Nightfood closed a $31 million transaction for a 155-room Holiday Inn property, describing it as an AI hospitality innovation hub. This location functions as a living laboratory where the company can refine its robotics systems, measure efficiency gains and demonstrate real-world utility. Soon after, Nightfood announced an agreement involving a $52.8 million Hilton Garden Inn portfolio, further broadening its operational base. These hospitality assets are intended not only to support robotics deployment but to eventually convert into perpetual equity, reducing financing costs and strengthening long-term capital efficiency. The dual outcome, operational scale and stronger capitalization, is a key component of the company’s strategy. Unlike robotics firms relying exclusively on external clients, Nightfood’s approach integrates technology into properties it owns or operates. This allows the company to collect performance data, trial new automation tools and capture the economic upside produced by efficiency improvements. It also positions the company to iterate faster, validate commercial use cases and ultimately expand with a more compelling value proposition. Equity Conversion Poised to Lift Shareholder Value Nightfood has stated that much of the newly consolidated temporary equity is expected to convert to perpetual equity upon uplisting, an inflection point that may materially strengthen long-term financial stability. Transforming temporary financing structures into permanent equity reduces uncertainty, improves debt-to-equity ratios and enhances valuation metrics that institutional investors closely monitor. “These transactions enhance our platform with substantial assets, revenue streams and operational capacity,” the company stated. “More importantly, the consolidation of these entities resulted in the recognition of $91.5 million in additional temporary equity, dramatically strengthening our balance sheet.” “Management believes that a significant portion of this temporary equity will convert to perpetual equity upon the company’s anticipated uplisting, further enhancing long-term shareholder value,” the announcement continued. “But beyond the financial impact, these acquisitions are cornerstones of our strategy to build a vertically integrated robotics ecosystem. By combining automation innovation with hard real estate assets, we are creating a unique model where our robotics technology can be deployed, tested, and scaled within our own properties, while simultaneously generating recurring hospitality revenue.” The company further emphasized that converting this equity upon uplisting could help establish a vertically integrated robotics ecosystem, where automation technology is deployed and scaled across company-controlled hotel environments. This model allows Nightfood to test, optimize and commercialize its robotics systems while generating recurring hospitality revenue and building long-term enterprise value. Advancing Toward Uplisting and Institutional-Grade Financial Standards The company’s strengthened financials support its next strategic objective: readiness for uplisting to a national exchange. Such a transition typically requires more rigorous governance, stronger balance sheet fundamentals and enhanced disclosure standards. For AI and robotics companies competing for market share, uplisting represents a powerful differentiator. Access to institutional capital markets is especially valuable for automation platforms that require sustained investment to scale hardware, software and deployment infrastructure. Firms operating solely on over-the-counter markets may face higher capital costs and reduced investor visibility. By restructuring its financial position and pursuing uplisting, Nightfood aims to align itself with companies capable of meeting institutional expectations, an increasingly important signal in an environment where investors are scrutinizing fundamentals more closely than ever. Strengthened Financials Support RaaS Acceleration Nightfood’s improved capital position is intended to fuel expansion of its RaaS platform, a subscription-driven business model that deploys autonomous robots across hotel operations. RaaS allows customers to adopt robotics with minimal upfront cost, while generating predictable recurring revenue for the provider, a useful model in industries facing labor instability. This milestone aligns with the company’s larger plan to transition under its robotics brand and operate as an asset-backed automation enterprise built around scalable hotel-based deployment centers. The company’s vertically integrated approach enables it to deploy robots for delivery, cleaning and operational analytics within its own properties, using these facilities as controlled testbeds for real-world optimization. In addition, strengthening the capital structure enhances Nightfood’s ability to secure future funding and advance its uplisting objectives. By retaining control, Nightfood can iterate more quickly, measure system performance and capture more of the economic gains associated with automation. These hotel hubs effectively function as distributed robotics development and deployment centers. Capital Strength Positions Company for High-Growth Market Expansion The company’s bolstered capital structure provides a runway for growth in the wider commercial automation sector. Service robotics are increasingly becoming mission-critical components of business operations, particularly in environments challenged by workforce shortages. Multiple industry research suggests that companies adopting robotics outperform peers during recovery cycles, due in part to efficiency gains and operating leverage associated with automation. With Nightfood’s expanding hospitality automation hubs and reinforced balance sheet, the company aims to establish a defensible position in this accelerating market. By combining real estate-backed deployment infrastructure, a recurring RaaS model and a strengthened financial foundation, Nightfood is positioning itself to participate meaningfully in the multibillion-dollar service robotics market. As automation shifts from experimental to essential across hospitality and commercial sectors, the company’s financial progress signals not only operational traction but a growing role in shaping the future of AI-powered hotel automation.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are pointing to a higher open for major indexes to kick off the holiday-shortened trading week; market participants are growing increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again next month; bitcoin regained some ground over the weekend after weeks of declines; U.S. officials are in Europe for tariff negotiations; and Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk's U.S.-listed shares are sinking following the results of its latest drug trial. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving higher this morning after experiencing significant volatility last week amid growing concerns about the possibility of an AI bubble. Stocks rose on Friday after a Federal Reserve official suggested support for an interest rate cut in December, but the three major indexes each posted big losses for the week. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.4% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.7% and 1%, respectively. The stock market will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving and will have an abbreviated trading session on Friday, but there are plenty of earnings reports and economic data in the next few days. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs for all sorts of loans, was at 4.04% recently, down slightly from Friday's close and trading at its lowest level in nearly a month. Gold futures and crude oil futures were down slightly. Market participants now expect the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate next month, after New York Fed President John Williams on Friday said that there may be "room for a further adjustment". Traders are now pricing in nearly a 75% cut at the Fed's Dec. 9-10 policy meeting, up from around 40% a week ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which forecasts rate movements based on fed funds futures trading data. The Fed trimmed its key fed funds rate at each of the past two meetings—in September and October—amid rising concerns about the health of the labor market. Fed officials recently have been divided in their views about whether another cut is warranted, amid ongoing concerns about inflationary pressure. Stocks tied to cryptocurrencies are gaining ground in premarket trading Monday, as bitcoin trades above the lows it hit at the end of last week. Bitcoin was at $86,000 recently, down from an overnight high of around $88,000 but up from Friday's level near $81,000, which was its lowest level since April. After trading as high as $125,000 in early October, the digital asset has tumbled in recent weeks as investor risk appetite waned amid concerns about the AI trade and uncertainty about the Fed's next move. Shares of Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, were up nearly 2% recently. Shares of bitcoin miner Mara Holdings (MARA) and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) were up nearly 3%. American officials including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick are in Europe Monday for a new round of trade negotiations. Ahead of the meeting, European Union officials said that they did not expect to reach a deal to lower tariffs on steel and other goods in the first day of talks, per Bloomberg. As of their last agreement earlier this year, the U.S. currently has a 15% tariff on most goods coming into the country from the E.U., along with a 50% tax on a range of products made with steel and aluminum. Shares of Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NVO) are down sharply this morning after the Ozempic maker's latest drug trial's results disappointed. The company had been looking to determine whether semaglutide, the active ingredient in weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, could also slow the cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease. The trial's goal was to slow the decline by at least 20%, CNBC reported, but Novo Nordisk said Monday that although the drug did improve unspecified "biomarkers" related to Alzheimer's, it did not slow the progression of the disease itself. Analysts had been uncertain of how likely the trial was to achieve its goals, and about whether demand for Ozempic and Wegovy are still growing. Novo Nordisk's U.S.-traded shares were down more than 10% ahead of the opening bell.

November 24, 2025 06:21 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 24 November 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced the top-line results from the 2-year primary analysis of evoke and evoke+ phase 3 trials in early-stage symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. The two trials were randomised, double-blinded, enrolled a total of 3808 adults and evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide compared to placebo on top of standard of care. The decision to pursue an Alzheimer’s disease indication with semaglutide was based on real-world evidence studies, pre-clinical models as well as post-hoc analyses from diabetes and obesity trials. The evoke and evoke+ trials did not confirm superiority of semaglutide versus placebo in the reduction of progression of Alzheimer’s disease, as measured by the change in Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score compared to baseline. While treatment with semaglutide resulted in improvement of Alzheimer’s disease-related biomarkers in both trials, this did not translate into a delay of disease progression. In the evoke trials with patients aged 55-85, suffering from mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease, semaglutide appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile consistent with previous semaglutide trials. To date, more than 37 million patient-years of semaglutide exposure have occurred across diverse patient populations. “Based on the significant unmet need in Alzheimer’s disease as well as a number of indicative data points, we felt we had a responsibility to explore semaglutide’s potential, despite a low likelihood of success. We are proud to have conducted two well-controlled phase 3 trials in Alzheimer’s disease that meet the highest standards of research and rigorous methodology,” said Martin Holst Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of Research and Development at Novo Nordisk. “We sincerely thank all participants and their caregivers for their meaningful contributions. While semaglutide did not demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, the extensive body of evidence supporting semaglutide continues to provide benefits for individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and related comorbidities.” The 1-year extension period in the evoke and evoke+ trials will be discontinued based on the efficacy results observed in the overall study population. Topline results from the evoke/evoke+ trials will be presented at the Clinical Trials in Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) conference on 3 December 2025, and full results at the 2026 Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases Conferences (AD/PD) in March 2026. About Alzheimer’s diseaseAlzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of all dementia cases worldwide. Dementia is a general term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive disease, where symptoms gradually worsen over time. Each stage of the disease presents different challenges for those living with the disease and their care partners. There is a significant unmet need for new treatment options that can slow down the progression of Alzheimer’s disease and reduce the overall burden on people affected and on society. About Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of BoxesThe Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) is a global measure of cognition and function obtained by interviewing both patient and care partner, commonly used staging tool for Alzheimer’s disease in research settings. It measures six areas covering cognition and function, where each area is scored between 0 (no dementia) and 3 (severe dementia). The summary score of the six areas (maximum score of 18), referred to as sum of boxes (CDR-SB) has been applied to clinical trials in Alzheimer’s disease to track progression and assess disease severity. In the evoke and evoke+ trials, the change in CDR-SB for semaglutide compared to placebo was measured from baseline to week 104. About the evoke/evoke+ studiesEvoke and evoke+ are large-scale trials investigating the disease-modifying potential of semaglutide in people with Alzheimer’s disease. They are global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled confirmatory phase 3 trials investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once-daily oral semaglutide 14 mg versus placebo in early-stage symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. The trials included men or women aged 55–85 years with MCI (defined as CDR global of 0.5) or mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (defined as CDR global score of 1.0) with confirmed amyloid positivity. In the evoke and evoke+ trials, 1,855 and 1,953 people respectively, were randomised 1:1 to semaglutide or placebo for 156 weeks (104-week main treatment phase and 52-week extension). About semaglutideSemaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist marketed under the brand names Ozempic® and Rybelsus® for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and Wegovy® for the treatment of chronic weight management. About Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark. Our purpose is to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases built upon our heritage in diabetes. We do so by pioneering scientific breakthroughs, expanding access to our medicines and working to prevent and ultimately cure disease.

Title: Chatbots To Checkout: How AI And BNPL Are Rewriting Holiday Shopping

ByCatherine Erdly, Contributor. By the time peak holiday shopping deals land in inboxes this year, a lot of shoppers will already have a digital co-pilot. Some will be asking AI tools to shortlist gifts, while others will be planning Buy Now, Pay Later repayments before they ever hit “buy.” Christmas 2025 is shaping up to be the most digitally assisted festive season yet, with software influencing how people decide what to buy and how to pay for it. What’s new isn’t just the technology, but the way people are using it. Convenience, confidence, and control now sit at the center of the holiday journey. Shoppers are happy to let algorithms shoulder some of the work—as long as they keep their hands on the steering wheel. That appetite for digital backup isn’t hypothetical; it’s already showing up in the numbers. Checkout.com’s latest research finds that 46% of UK consumers would be open to using an AI agent to help with their Christmas shopping, and those who are interested would allow an average “trust threshold” of £200 for the AI to spend on their behalf. In fact, 42% of respondents admit to already using tools like ChatGPT for gift ideas. Jenny Hadlow, chief operating officer at Checkout.com, believes this could mark a real turning point. “Every year there’s a new trend shaping how we shop for Christmas, and this year, agentic AI could transform how we find, choose and buy our festive essentials,” she says. “The real potential of agentic shopping lies in its ability to navigate the vast landscape of options—comparing deals, scanning holiday sales, and optimising for the best consumer outcomes, from price to personal preference.” That doesn’t mean the concerns have disappeared though. Checkout.com’s research highlights fear of losing control, missing the personal touch, and worries about fraud and privacy as the main reasons people hesitate to let AI do more. When asked what would build trust, shoppers point to secure systems, easy returns and refunds, spending limits they can set themselves, and instant purchase alerts. In other words, they want AI to filter the noise and surface smarter choices—not to make opaque decisions in the background. Beyond fully “agentic” systems, AI is already reshaping how people research products long before they reach the checkout. Jen Pollard, Senior Analyst at Visualsoft, believes that generative AI shopping, like Shopify-ChatGPT Instant Checkout and Google AI search, “may have an early impact.” However, Pollard is hesitant to label this shopping season as “transformational” and is instead leaning more towards “experimental.” But Klaviyo takes a different stance, describing Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2025 as the first truly “AI-fueled” holiday shopping season. The company reports that more than half of consumers say they’ll use AI tools to compare deals or plan purchases. Instead of one frantic sales day, Klaviyo sees spending spread across a 16-day window that begins roughly 10 days before Black Friday. Shopify’s Global Holiday Retail Report points in a similar direction. The company finds that 64% of shoppers expect to use AI for at least one task in their holiday journey, while 88% of businesses are investing in AI-driven discovery tools. At the same time, 73% of consumers still value human interaction somewhere in the process. Even as more shoppers rely on AI tools and digital wallets, they still anchor decisions in trust, loyalty, and connection. Research from LoyaltyLion shows that 71% of Gen Z and Millenials say they feel more emotionally connected to brands through loyalty programs, while Antavo’s data suggests roughly seven in ten shoppers join those programs primarily for rewards, discounts, or cash back, with a meaningful share also motivated by personalized offers and perks like free shipping or early access. For smaller businesses, that blend of automation, loyalty, and humanity is particularly important. Andrew Goodacre, CEO of the British Independent Retailers Association, argues that artificial intelligence has moved from buzzword to practical tool. “AI is no longer a distant concept requiring huge investment or technical expertise,” he says. “It’s readily accessible, often affordable, and increasingly user-friendly. For independent retailers, this is transformative.” He also stresses that AI should sit alongside human service, not replace it. The strongest model is “AI plus human”: digital tools handle stock management, basic queries, and marketing, while staff focus on personalized service which keeps people coming back. If AI is changing how people decide what to buy, BNPL is quietly changing how they decide when and with what means to pay. Clearpay’s Festive Insights Wrapped report finds that more than a third of shoppers are planning to use BNPL this season to give them extra flexibility, with adoption strongest among Gen Z and Millennial consumers. Their motivations are mostly pragmatic. Clearpay reports that 63% of those who plan to use BNPL cite convenience as a key reason, 58% point to reliability, 52% to flexibility, and 51% to speed. Many shoppers are not trying to expand their overall budget; they are looking to smooth out the impact of big-ticket purchases or spread the cost of multiple family commitments over several paychecks. Rich Bayer, CEO at Clearpay, sees that as a defining pattern for 2025. “The festive season is always a special time, but 2025 brings fresh financial challenges for many households,” he says. “What we’re seeing is a pragmatic approach; people are still planning to celebrate, but they’re planning earlier, being practical with their budgets, prioritising self-care, and turning to tools like BNPL to help them manage their spending responsibly.” However, that pragmatism doesn’t eliminate risk. Used thoughtlessly, BNPL can still encourage overspending or lead to missed payments and fees. As BNPL becomes standard at checkout, retailers and providers will both be judged on how transparent they are with shoppers. This holiday season, AI, BNPL, and one-click checkout are no longer nice-to-haves; they’re must-haves as the modern-day consumer expects smart recommendations, flexible ways to pay, and a checkout that feels instant. But even still, shoppers gravitate toward brands they recognize, clear terms at checkout, and real humans when something goes wrong. The retailers that will stand out aren’t the ones with the flashiest tech, but the ones that combine digital speed with transparency, loyalty, and a human tone, making holiday shopping feel both effortless and genuinely worth returning to.

(“WeRide” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: WRD, HKEX:0800), a global leader in autonomous driving technology, today announced its unaudited financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2025. Financial and Operational Highlights Global Commercialization - Robotaxis Tier-1 Cities, China Abu Dhabi, UAE Zurich, Switzerland Other Global Cities Global Commercialization – Other L4 Product Lines One-Stage End-to-End L2+ Solutions Management Commentary Tony Han,WeRide's Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "In 3Q 2025, WeRide's regulatory and commercial achievements spanning eight countries demonstrated the convergence of advanced technology and global execution capabilities. We've achieved a number of significant milestones, most notably securing the fully driverless commercial robotaxi permit in Abu Dhabi, with our operations there soon reaching unit economics breakeven, a critical milestone that validates our path to profitability at scale. As we progress toward our goal of deploying hundreds of thousands of robotaxis by 2030, WeRide is well-positioned to capitalize on the autonomous driving opportunity. The depth of our technology stack, breadth of our global partnerships, and strength of our regulatory relationships position us to capture significant value as autonomous mobility transforms transportation worldwide.” Jennifer Li, WeRide’s Chief Financial Officer and Head of International, added, “Our Q3 financial performance represents substantial improvement in both growth trajectory and operational leverage. Revenue reached RMB171.0 million, representing 144.3% year-over-year growth, while the 761.0% increase in robotaxi revenue provides strong validation of our technology from both third parties and end users. Our diversified portfolio across products, services, and geographies continues to provide multiple avenues for sustained growth. Our gross margin expansion to 32.9% demonstrates our platform’s improving efficiency as we scale. Our Hong Kong dual primary listing, supported by reputable institutional investors globally, strengthens our balance sheet and establishes WeRide as an attractive public investment opportunity in autonomous driving.” Unaudited Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results Revenues Total revenue grew 144.3% YoY to RMB171.0 million (US$24.0 million) in 3Q2025, compared to RMB70.0 million in the same period of 2024. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue was RMB114.7 million (US$16.1 million) compared to RMB65.5 million in the same period of 2024. The increase of cost of revenue was mainly due to (i) an increase in cost of goods sold, aligned with the sales increase; and (ii) a slight increase in costs of services, affected by an increase in costs of intelligent data services, partially offset by a decrease in costs of ADAS research and development (R&D) services. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit was RMB56.3 million (US$7.9 million) compared to RMB4.6 million in the same period of 2024, and gross margin was 32.9% compared to 6.5% in the same period of 2024. There were certain ADAS R&D service projects in 3Q2024 that incurred higher-than-expected costs, along with inventory write-downs. As no such items occurred in 3Q2025, both gross profit and gross margin recorded a significant YoY increase. Furthermore, certain ADAS R&D service projects with better margin profile further contributed to the increase of overall gross margin in 3Q2025. Operating Expenses Operating expenses were RMB435.8 million (US$61.2 million) compared to RMB895.7 million in the same period of 2024. Net Loss Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per ADS2 Balance Sheet Other Corporate Developments Exchange Rate Information This announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to U.S. dollars are made at a rate of RMB7.1190 to US$1.00, the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of September 30, 2025. Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures In evaluating its business, the Company considers and uses the non-IFRS financial measure of adjusted net loss as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance. The Company believes that adjusted net loss provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s consolidated results of operations in the same manner as it helps the Company’s management. The Company defines adjusted net loss as net loss for the period excluding share-based compensation expenses, fair value changes of financial assets at FVTPL and changes in the carrying amounts of preferred shares and other financial instruments subject to redemption and other preferential rights. The Company presents the non-IFRS financial measure because it is used by its management to evaluate its operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net loss enables the Company’s management to assess the Company’s operating results without considering the impact of the aforementioned non-cash adjustment items that it does not consider to be indicative of its core operations. Accordingly, the Company believes that the use of this non-IFRS financial measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors. This non-IFRS financial measure is not defined under IFRS and is not presented in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using the adjusted net loss is that it does not reflect all items of expenses that affect the Company’s operations. Further, this non-IFRS measure may differ from the non-IFRS information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore its comparability may be limited. The non-IFRS financial measure should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to loss for the period or any other measure of performance information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS or as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review the Company’s historical non-IFRS financial measure in light of the most directly comparable IFRS measure, as shown below. The non-IFRS financial measure presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measure presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting the usefulness of such measures when analyzing the Company’s data comparatively. It is encouraged that you review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Conference Call Information The Company’s management team will host an earnings conference call at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, November 24, 2025 (or at 9:00 PM Beijing Time on Monday, November 24, 2025). Details for the conference call are as follows: Event Title: WeRide Inc.

Title: Analyst who called the dot-com bubble says Americans are turning a deaf ear to AI warnings—and a worse meltdown than 2008 looms

Time Published: 2025-11-23T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Albert Edwards, the outspoken global strategist at Société Générale—a figure who even refers to himself as a “perma bear”—is certain that the current U.S. equity market, driven largely by high-flying tech and AI, is experiencing a dangerous bubble. (Société Générale, to be clear, does not hold the view that U.S. stocks or AI stocks are in a bubble, noting that Edwards is employed as the in-house alternative view.) While history often repeats itself, Edwards warned recently that the circumstances surrounding this cycle’s inevitable collapse are fundamentally different, potentially leading to a deeper and more painful reckoning for the economy and the average investor. “I think there’s a bubble but there again I always think there’s a bubble,” Edwards told Bloomberg’s Merryn Somerset Webb in a recent appearance on her podcast Merryn Talks Money, noting that during each cycle there is always a “very plausible narrative, very compelling.” However, he was unwavering in his conclusion: “It will end in tears, that much I’m sure of.” Edwards told Fortune in an interview that previous theories about a bubble were “very convincing in 1999 and early 2000; they were very convincing in 2006–2007.” Each time, he said, the “surge in the market was so relentless” that he just stopped talking about bubbles, “because clients get pissed off with you repeating the same thing over and over again and being wrong,” only to change their tune after the bubble bursts. “Generally, when you’re gripped by a bubble, people just don’t want to listen because they’re making so much money.” As he himself frequently points out, Edwards is known as a very bearish market strategist who has made some high-profile and dramatic predictions, often warning about major stock market crashes and recessions. His track record includes famously calling the dotcom bubble, but it also includes warnings that haven’t panned out, such as predicting a potential 75% drop in the S&P 500 from peaks—worse than the 2008 Financial Crisis lows. When the New York Times profiled Edwards in 2010, it noted that the chuckling, Birkenstocks-wearing analyst had been predicting a Japan-style stagnation for U.S. equity markets since 1997 (a prediction he repeated in his interview with Fortune). Still, Edwards insists that the current parallels to the late 1990s Nasdaq bubble are clear: extremely rich valuations in tech, with some U.S. companies trading at over 30x forward earnings, justified by compelling growth narratives. Just as the TMT (technology, media, telecom) sector attracted vast, sometimes wasted capital investment in the 1990s, Edwards argued that today’s enthusiasm echoes that earlier era. There are two key differences that could lead to a much worse outcome this time, though. In previous cycles, Edwards explained, the catalyst for a bubble’s demise was usually the monetary authority’s tightening cycle—the Federal Reserve hiking rates and exposing market froth. This time, with the Fed lowering rates, that trigger is conspicuously absent. Bank of America Research has noted the rarity of central banks cutting rates amid rising inflation, which has occurred just 16% of the time since 1973. Ominously, BofA released a note on the “Ghosts of 2007” in August. Instead of tightening, Edwards anticipates the Fed will move away from quantitative tightening and likely shift to quantitative easing “quite soon” because of issues in the U.S. repo markets, another ghost from the Great Recession. The Fed itself issued a staff report in 2021 on repo issues, writing in 2021 that trading between 2007 and 2009 “highlighted important vulnerabilities of the U.S. repo market.” Repo issues reemerged in the pandemic, with the Richmond Fed noting that interest rates “spiked dramatically higher” starting in 2019. Edwards told Bloomberg that the absence of hawkish policy could lead to a “further melt-up,” making the eventual burst even more damaging. Poking fun at himself, Edwards said, “I just got bored being bearish, basically rattling my chains saying, ‘This is all a bubble; it’s all going to collapse.’” He said that he can see how the bubble can actually keep going for much longer than a perma bear like himself would find logical, “and actually that’s when something just comes out the woodwork and takes the legs from out from under the bubble.” “What’s more worrying about the AI bubble,” Edwards told Fortune, “is how much more dependent the economy is on this theme, not just for the business investments, which is driving growth,” but also the fact that consumption growth is being dominated far more than normal by the top quintile. In other words, the richest Americans who are heavily invested in equities are driving more of the economy than during previous bubbles, accounting for a much larger proportion of consumption. “So the economy, if you like, is more vulnerable than it was in the ’87 crash,” Edwards explained, with a 25% or greater correction in stocks meaning that consumer spending will surely suffer—let alone a 50% lurch. Edwards told Bloomberg he was concerned about the widespread participation of retail investors who have been dragged into the market, encouraged to “just buy the dips.” This belief that “the stock market never goes down” is dangerous, Edwards warned, arguing that a 30% or even a 50% decline is very possible. The inequality of American society and the heavy concentration among high earners whose wealth has been “inflated by the stock market” is a major concern for Edwards, who pointed out that if there is a major stock market correction, then U.S. consumption will be “hit very, very badly indeed,” and the entire economy will suffer. This view is increasingly shared by less über-bearish voices on Wall Street, such as Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s Lisa Shalett. In many ways, Edwards told Fortune, we’re overdue for a correction, noting that apart from two months during the pandemic, there hasn’t been a recession since 2008. “That’s a bloody long time, and the business cycle eventually always goes into recession.” He said it’s been so long that his perma-bear instincts are confused. “The fact I’m less worried about an imminent collapse [right now] makes me worried,” Edwards added with a laugh. Edwards told Fortune that he’s been through various cycles and bubbles and he gained his perma-bear status in the mid-1990s, when he felt a distant earthquake happening in Asia. “You’ve been around the block a few times, you just do become cynical,” he said, before correcting himself: “That’s not the right word. You become extremely skeptical of the full narrative.” He proudly repeats the story about how, when he was at Dresdner Kleinwort in the ’90s, he wrote with skepticism about Malaysia’s economic boom at the time, only to be surprised when Thailand blew up first. Nevertheless, he said, “we lost all our banking licenses [in Malaysia] because of what I wrote,” adding that the story is still proudly pinned to his X.com account. “I had to sort of basically hide under my desk,” Edwards said of the inward reception to the emergence of his inner bear. “Corporate finance banking departments certainly didn’t appreciate losing all their banking licenses. But in retrospect, you know, they avoided a final year of lending to Malaysia before it blew up. They didn’t thank me afterwards.” Beyond equity valuations, Edwards has been highlighting two other major underlying risks that point to systemic vulnerability. First, Edwards emphasized the long-term risk of inflation in the West, driven by “fiscal incontinence.” Despite short-term cyclical deflationary pressure emanating from China—which has seen 12 successive quarters of year-on-year declines in its GDP deflator—Edwards said he believes the path of least resistance for highly indebted Western politicians will be “money printing.” At some point, the mathematics for fiscal sustainability “just do not add up,” forcing central banks to intervene through “yield curve control” or quantitative easing to hold down bond yields. This is where Edwards’ long-held thesis about Japan comes in, what he calls “the Ice Age.” Around 1996, he said, he started thinking that “what’s happening in Japan will come to Europe and the U.S. with a lag.” He explained that the bursting of the Japanese stock bubble led to all kinds of nasty things: real interest rates collapsing, inflation going to zero, bond yields going to zero. Ultimately, it was a period of low growth that Japan still has not been able to break out of. The difference with the U.S., he added, is that Japanification actually started happening in 2000 with the dotcom bubble bursting, but “the relationship broke” between the economy and asset prices as the Fed began “throwing money” at the problem through QE. The U.S. has essentially been in a 25-year bubble since then that is due to burst any day now, he argued—it’s been due any day for a quarter-century. “We’re going to end up with runaway inflation at some point,” Edwards told Fortune, “because, I mean, that’s the end game, right? There’s no appetite to cut back the deficits. We bring back the QE, if and when this bubble bursts, the only solution is more QE, and then we end up with inflation, maybe even worse than 2022.” Edwards also sees a smoking gun in home prices. “You look at the U.S. housing market, you think, ‘Well, actually, is the Fed just too loose relative to everywhere else?’ Because why should other housing bubbles have deflated in terms of house price earnings ratio, but the U.S. is still stuck up there at maximum valuation or close to it?” In a flourish that shows why Edwards is so respected despite his broken-record reputation, he notes that in a Bloomberg Opinion piece from 2018, legendary former Fed Chair Paul Volcker “eviscerated the Fed just before he died.” The central banker who famously slew inflation in the 1980s argued that the modern era’s loose monetary policy was “a grave error of judgment…basically just kicking the can down the road.” Edwards shared an OECD chart with Fortune to show just how much U.S. housing has decoupled from global markets because the Fed has been too loose. The analyst also said he applied his skepticism to private equity, an asset class that he sees having benefited immensely from years of falling bond yields and leverage. Private equity’s advantage has been its tax treatment and the fact that “it doesn’t have to mark itself to market, so it isn’t very volatile.” However, the sector is highly leveraged, and if the global environment shifts to a secular bear market for bonds, he said that would be a “major problem.” Recent high-profile bankruptcies have started to leak into bond markets, prompting concern of “credit cockroaches,” as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently labeled the issue. Drawing on the metaphor that “you never have just one cockroach,” Edwards warned that these bankruptcies signal deeper issues in a highly leveraged sector that has spread its “tentacles…deeply into the real economy.” Fortune notes to Edwards that more mainstream, less bearish voices are sounding similar warnings, including Mohamed El-Erian at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference and Jeffrey Gundlach, the “bond king,” who takes a similarly skeptical view of private equity. Edwards agreed that something is in the air. “I would say there are more voices of skepticism. And again, this is one thing which makes me worry. This bubble can go on. If it is a bubble [it] can go on quite a long while. Well, we can kick the can down the road many times. Normally, the skeptics are swept aside.” For investors trapped between the fear of a collapse and the fear of missing a melt-up, Edwards advised investors to take him with a grain of salt but be mindful of potential warning signs. “I say that I predict a recession every year. Don’t listen to me, but these are the things you should be looking out for.” Paraphrasing an infamous quote from former Citi CEO Chuck Prince that summed up the bubble mentality with a metaphor about a dance party, Edwards recommended: “In terms of dancing while the music’s still playing, you have to decide whether to be in front of the band, pogoing, or dancing close to the fire escape, ready to get out first.”
