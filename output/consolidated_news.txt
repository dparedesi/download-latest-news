US stocks have led the equity market in recent years and strategists at BlackRock's Investment Institute don't see that narrative changing in 2025. "Currently, across all the scenarios in the outlook, the platform is gravitating towards the US corporate strength scenario, which is another way of calling for US exceptionalism," BlackRock Investment Institute chief investment strategist Wei Li said during a media roundtable on Wednesday. Li cited stronger earnings growth seen in the US this year and the expectation that earnings growth will continue to broaden outside of the "Magnificent Seven" names that have powered the stock market higher over the last two years. This view has been a common refrain from Wall Street firms offering bullish outlooks for 2025 over the last month. "Earnings is almost everything when it comes to longer-term equity returns," Li said, adding the strongest revisions for next year have come from the US and Japan, where BlackRock is also overweight equities. BlackRock's call for continued US exceptionalism has been echoed at other firms on Wall Street during 2025 outlook roundtables. On Monday, Bank of America senior US economist Aditya Bhave told Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal the US economy will likely outperform in 2025. In October, the team at JPMorgan Asset Management said it believes the US's role in the rise of artificial intelligence will help its economy outpace others around the world. The firm said this will result in US equities continuing to dominate globally over the next decade. "We expect extraordinary earnings growth will settle at still-elevated levels for mega-cap tech while reaccelerating in other areas of the market," JPMorgan Asset Management's chief global strategist David Kelly wrote in his team's 2025 outlook. "This broadening, coupled with resilient economic fundamentals, policy tailwinds, and secular trends, should support a more inclusive rally in the year ahead." On a sector level, BlackRock noted Wednesday that Utilities (XLU) should be set to benefit from the broadening of the AI trade due to the increased power demands to operate AI servers. All of this puts BlackRock further overweight US equities headed into 2025 and betting on a "pro-risk" environment in 2025. "In an environment where there's spirit animals that are poignant, it's not clear exactly who's going to take away the punch bowl in this environment," said Jean Boivin, the head of BlackRock's Investment Institute. "We're constructive, we're pro-risk ... But I think we need to be mindful of excessive risk-taking at some point as well down the road." And while BlackRock doesn't issue an S&P 500 target for the year ahead, its bullish stance on US stocks has been reflected across Wall Street's 2025 outlooks. Strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance have issued 2025 year-end S&P 500 targets as low as 6,400 and as high as 7,007. The index closed at 6,086 on Wednesday, meaning the low-end 6,400 target represents about a 5% upside in the benchmark index over the next year. Meanwhile, the high end of forecasts is calling for another 15% gain in the S&P 500 over the next 12 months. Strategists believe another strong year of growth in both the US economy and corporate earnings, combined with a pro-business administration in the White House and Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, will propel stocks higher. In a Tuesday research note detailing his Street-high 7,007 S&P 500 target, Wells Fargo equity strategist Christopher Harvey wrote the data "did not support" a weak or negative year for the S&P 500. "2025 is likely to be a solid-to-strong year," Harvey wrote. Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on X @_joshschafer.

Title: W.Va. Rep.-Elect Riley Moore: How GOP Can Deliver for Working-Class Families

Send an email to Bradley. President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 election marked the first time in 20 years that a Republican presidential candidate won the popular vote in addition to the electoral vote. The commanding fashion of Trump’s historic comeback was further proof that the political realignment Trump started nearly a decade ago—transforming the Republican Party into the party of the working class—is being further cemented. And it’s no surprise, then, that victors of down-ballot elections are increasingly representing the coalition that now makes up the Republican base. Rep.-elect Riley Moore, R-W.Va., is a perfect example, and he joined me on this week’s episode of “The Signal Sitdown.” Now that the GOP has rebranded itself as a multiracial, working-class party, our conversation particularly focuses on how Republican lawmakers in Washington, D.C., can deliver for their supporters. “People don’t want to monkey around,” Moore said of the incoming Congress. “They don’t want to horse around on any of this stuff. They just want to go. President Trump has got the mandate, and President Trump has got the vision, and that’s what we’re going to work on.” This vision is not only important to the president, but to the American people who, for the first time since President Grover Cleveland in the late 1800s, have sent a former president back to the White House. Though Moore will be a freshman member of Congress, he has experience delivering policy victories for a constituency made of working-class voters as the state treasurer of West Virginia. The Mountain State, which voted 70% for Trump in the 2024 election, is a good encapsulation of the ethos that propelled Trump to the forefront of American politics. His Make America Great Again movement has always felt more like West Virginia than Texas, and for good reason, as West Virginians have shouldered much of the burden for Washington’s globalist immigration, trade, and foreign policies. “We’re tired of being lied to, and we’re tired of being taken advantage of,” Moore said of West Virginians. “I mean, we mine the coal that forged the steel that built the buildings, that built the airplanes and the warships and the rails and everything else that built the United States.” “And what do we get?” Moore added. “An opioid crisis and destroying our coal industry.” For too long, Washington, D.C., has had a “total disregard for the feelings of the people of West Virginia,” Moore told me. “It dates back to [the North American Free Trade Agreement], particularly in my district—northern panhandle specifically would be a great example—where we do a lot of steel manufacturing,” Moore explained. “We had tens of thousands of people working in that industry, obviously. That’s not the case now due to globalization and offshoring and dumping of cheap steel, which, for some reason, people of this town have allowed to happen for successive decades. Letting China into the World Trade Organization, most favored nation status, and all these other things piled on top of it that has really crushed a state like West Virginia.” Fast-forward to President Barack Obama’s tenure, and the destruction accelerated. Due to what Moore calls “environmental extremism,” West Virginia “lost 30,000 coal mining jobs in just a few years due to the Obama administration.” The continued leftward lurch of economic policies from both public and private institutions has only compounded some of West Virginia’s woes. “We had coal operators coming to me saying, ‘I’m losing access to capital. We can’t finance our stuff. No one will bank with us. We’re getting debanked all over the place,’” said Moore, adding: “This [environmental, social, and governance] movement that was destroying West Virginia.” West Virginia responded by chasing out as many ESG-promoting financial institutions from the state as possible, particularly by divesting West Virginia taxpayer dollars from companies like BlackRock. “The working class in West Virginia was like, ‘Yes! Thank you for doing this: fighting for our jobs, fighting for our economy, fighting for our way of life,’” Moore said. Moore said he’s bringing the same mindset with him to Washington. “They did not elect me to get on television and tell them that they’re getting screwed. They already know that. They know that. They elected me to do something about it.” Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low. That’s because they are out of touch, deliberately lie to the American public, and ignore conservative audiences. By supporting The Daily Signal Institute today, you will help cut through the liberal media spin and provide honest, thorough, and responsible reporting to millions of Americans and decisionmakers in Washington.

By Wen-Yee Lee and Fanny Potkin TAIPEI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said. TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said. Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots. The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year. TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential. Two of the sources said Apple and Advanced Micro Devices are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment. However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said. All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan. Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against other AI stocks that will skyrocket. Some investors are heavily scrutinizing Big Tech’s AI spending. Despite these hefty expenditures, Big Tech has been enjoying solid revenues and earnings growth. Yung-Yu Ma, CIO at BMO Wealth Management, recently joined Yahoo Finance to shed light on the overall AI sector outlook heading into 2024. Ma believes that companies are increasing their investments in AI in anticipation of higher returns. He said that it makes sense that the market is less likely to be enthusiastic about this situation. Ma argued that while spending on AI is likely to increase, there is a certainty that the results will soon show, maybe by the end of 2025. He added that the market will probably see healthy earnings growth in 2025. Spending is broadly going to drive these earnings, particularly AI and its different use cases such as data centers, electricity grids, and other infrastructure. He expects an overall growth in valuation and shared that Big Tech is extremely confident and committed to pouring investment into the sector. 2024 has been quite a year for artificial intelligence. Existing startups like Anthropic and Databricks have been performing exceptionally well and transforming the industry. Anthropic is an AI safety and research company behind the OpenAI rival, Claude. On November 24, Anthropic extended its partnership with AWS, involving another $4 billion investment, bringing the total to $8 billion. The partnership also positions AWS as Anthropic’s primary cloud and training partner. Keeping up with the partnership, on December 4, Anthropic began optimizing Claude models to be able to run on AWS Trainium 2. Databricks, the data and AI company, is another AI startup crucial to the AI revolution. Some of the products by Databricks include data management solutions, data warehousing, real-time analytics, data sharing, and data governance. The company is expanding to new heights. On November 6, the company partnered with KT Corporation to boost data and AI innovation in Korea. Following the trend, on November 20, Databricks announced it saw 70% annualized growth in its French business and has launched a new office in central Paris. To come up with AI stocks that will skyrocket, we consulted media reports to shortlist stocks that are expected to perform exceptionally well according to analysts and strategists. After consulting 10 similar rankings on the internet we examined the Street-High upside for each stock and picked the ones with the highest upside, as of December 3, 2024. Our list is in ascending order of the street high upside as of December 3, 2024. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment for each stock.

Title: The 10 gaming trends for 2025 that will transform how we play and create

Our expert games writer predicts the gaming trends for 2025, including Nintendo Switch 2, the rise of indie gaming, the impact of generative AI and how Unreal Engine 5 will shake things up . When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Predicting the gaming trends for 2025 starts with reflecting on what's happened in 2024. After another tumultuous year of layoffs and studio closures, many folks in the games industry will be staggering into 2025 with an understandable sense of anxiety. As while Epic Games has had a good year with Unreal Engine 5 and Nintendo continues to buck the trends, many studios have suffered. But there are some potential bright spots ahead. The launch of Nintendo Switch 2 (read our Switch 2 rumours feature for the latest info), the follow-up to the almighty Switch handheld, is sure to buoy the industry, as will the juggernaut that is GTA 6, even if it swallows attention from other titles like a black hole sucking in light. Yet there’s still that lingering sense of unease. Can new live-service games succeed in the market, given the disaster of Concord? Will generative AI improve games, or make things worse? Will Microsoft's Game Pass succeed, or are subscription services on the way out? In the midst of all this uncertainty, it’s perhaps comforting that games with relatively simple, old-school design are cutting through, like the excellent Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 and Still Wakes The Deep, indicating that bigger, more beautiful and more complicated worlds aren’t necessarily better, or even what players particularly want. The rise of 'AAA-lite' games, advances in AI for indie development, more cross-platform and cross-media games, as well perhaps a relaunch of classic IP as publishers play on nostalgia in the wake of Silent Hill 2: Remake's success, could all point to a better, more balanced year for games and indies. In light of all that, here are ten gaming trends and predictions to look out for in 2025. These include new launches, advances in tech, new ways of working and more. Anticipation is mounting for the follow-up to Nintendo’s mega-hit Switch console, which has sold more than 146 million units since its release in March 2017. Nintendo has said that an announcement on Switch 2, or whatever it ends up being called, will be made by the end of March 2025 at the latest, and we already know it will be backwards compatible with the Switch. Will Nintendo play it safe by essentially making another Switch with beefier specs and a better screen? Or will Nintendo follow past precedent by introducing some kind of new hardware gimmick? My money’s on some kind of dual-screen setup, toying with our love and nostalgia for Nintendo DS, but Nintendo does like to surprise us. Remember that alarm clock?

What seems almost certain is that we’ll get a new 3D Mario, probably as a launch title, since it’s been seven whole years since the last one, Super Mario Odyssey. And if we’re lucky, Metroid Prime 4 Beyond might make its long-awaited debut alongside the new console, ever since being teased at a Nintendo Direct earlier this year. Sony's live service shooter Concord was the biggest video-game flop of 2024, shut down just two weeks after its launch in August as a result of catastrophically low player counts. Sony later shuttered the game’s creator, Firewalk Studios, having only bought the studio in 2023. Earlier in the year, Warner Bros.’ Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League made a similarly disappointing debut, showing that even licensed properties can struggle in vain to attract players away from well-established live-service titles such as Fortnite and GTAV. These high-profile failures are likely to make big publishers think twice about launching new live-service titles in 2025. At Sony, as reported in sister site Games Radar, The Last of Us Online has already been cancelled, but reportedly there’s still a Horizon MMO in the works: it remains to be seen whether it will live to see the light of day, given the Concord debacle. Sony also has at least two other live-service games lined up, currently without a firm release date: Marathon from Bungie, developer of Destiny 2 (read our deep dive into making the The Final Shape expansion), and Fairgame$ from Jade Raymond’s Haven Studios. Will they release in 2025? And can they fare any better? Concord has shown how difficult it is to launch new IP in the live-service space, but one game could potentially buck the trend: early feedback on Valve’s Deadlock has been positive from sister games site PCGamer, and there’s every chance it could burst out of beta in 2025. Microsoft reportedly had some lengthy internal debates (according to The Verge) about whether to put Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass. Since the purchase of Activision Blizzard, Call of Duty has become Microsoft’s jewel in the crown, but shoving the new CoD game onto Microsoft’s subscription service would naturally mean sacrificing some hefty day-one sales on Xbox. The fact that it happened shows Microsoft is committed to making Game Pass succeed. Circana reported that Game Pass subscriptions surged on the release of Black Ops 6, but the big question is whether these new subscribers will stick around for the long haul. Expect to see older Call of Duty games being drip fed onto Game Pass over the next 12 months to keep these new subscribers interested. Microsoft has a lot coming to, and on, Game Pass, including the new Indiana Jones and the Golden Circle blockbuster, Stalker 2 and in 2025 Avowed from respected RPG team Obsidian Entertainment is come to the service, alongside Fable, DOOM: The Dark Ages and Gears of War E-Day. At the same time, Microsoft is pushing Game Pass onto as many devices as possible, including Samsung TVs and Amazon Fire Stick, backed by the confusing ‘This is an Xbox’ ad campaign. There's a clear strategy to move beyond hardware and release games across platforms, something other publishers are also looking into, including Sony with its PlayStation Plus subscription. But if subscriber numbers falter in 2025, this could signal the end of the Game Pass experiment: if Call of Duty can’t make subscribers stick around, then surely nothing can. The past two years have seen the release of a plethora of big-hitter VR and AR devices, including PSVR2, Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 (all featured in our best VR headsets roundup). But 2025 seems to be a bit quieter on the new hardware front. "We're unlikely to see Apple's next headset this year, though reports on the specific timeline are conflicted," says Henry Stockdale, staff writer at UploadVR. "Samsung's upcoming Android XR headset is also on the way, but that's reportedly been delayed,” he adds, meaning we’re increasingly unlikely to see it in 2025. But there’s an outside chance that Valve might spring a surprise. “We've recently seen controller models emerge on SteamVR for the rumoured Valve Deckard,” Henry says, referring to Valve’s long-in-gestation follow up to its Index VR headset from 2019. “Knowing Valve though, whether that's actually coming soon is anyone's guess.” Although Apple Vision Pro 2 might be a long way off, there’s a chance we could see a cheaper version of the Apple Vision headset by the end of the year, which could give Meta a headache, unless Quest 4 is incoming. The idea of creating generative-AI powered non-player characters (NPCs) has captivated some, who see it as a way to generate realistic, expansive conversations in place of characters that default to the same repeating phrases. Others, meanwhile, like Inkle’s Jon Ingold, merely regard it as a way of “creating an unworkable design purely to employ AI”. Whatever your viewpoint, we will start to see generative-AI powered NPCs emerge in 2025, such as the antagonist of Meaning Machine’s Dead Meat, a game that sees you posing questions to a large language model-powered suspect in an attempt to extract a murder confession. We might also start to see the first NPCs made using Nvidia ACE, which is now available as a plugin for Unreal Engine 5. We've already got to test Nvidia's character AI for games and it's actually remarkable, but also fallible and has revealed good writers will be in demand even with gen AI characters. Other major developers are experimenting with gen AI for game design and NPCs, ahead of them all seems to be Ubisoft, that could have a game out in 2025 which makes use of Nvidia Audio2Face AI, to create its own NEO NPC, as well as other AI apps. Read 'How Ubisoft’s New generative AI prototype changes the narrative for NPCs' for an insight. Since its release in 2013, GTA V has sold well over 200 million copies, and the launch of GTA 6 is set to upend all sales records, such is the demand for a sequel. Indeed, the announcement that Grand Theft Auto 6 would launch in 2025 was so momentous that it broke through the navel-gazing world of video games and into the world at large, making headlines on the BBC and other mainstream news channels. Accordingly, although GTA 6 is likely to lift the overall revenue of the games industry, its debut will be devastating for any games released in its wake. "No one will play anything else for six months after it," says Mike Rose, head of indie publisher No More Robots. "In the weeks, months after GTA 6 comes out, some people will never buy a game ever again. They'll play this game, and that will be it: it will become their Roblox." Sam Barlow, founder of Immortality maker Half Mermaid Productions, has noted the trend for more ambitious, open-world indie games like Sable and Tchia over the past few years, with “people stepping out of the assumptions around pixel art and two-dimensional things into more full-bodied 3D experiences”. He thinks this trend will continue in 2025, with indie developers using engines like Unreal Engine 5 and Unity 6 to streamline many processes and create bigger worlds rather than making the prettiest games possible. "The cool thing with indies is, if you have more powerful machines and engines, it's not about maxing them out, it's just you can make things quicker". Indie auteur Sam Barlow isn't the first developer to say this, when we spoke with Anna Hollinrake about making her first game as an indie dev, the colourful open-world narrative game Crescent County, she revealed the move to Unreal Engine 5 made the larger world design, for a small team, possible. "We actually ended up making it too big," she told us. The EU Digital Markets Act has paved the way for rival app stores to come to iOS, and the Epic Game Store has already launched on Apple devices. “Unfortunately very few people seem to have noticed,” says Neil Long, founder of MobileGamer.biz, “and I’m not all that confident that even the promise of regular free games, like Epic offers through its PC store, will help.” Neil thinks that the monster hit Fortnite isn’t enough to tempt most people away from Apple’s own App Store, or Google’s equivalent. “Epic needs more killer content to get people to use its stores and make it clear why people should bother when the default iOS and Android stores do a solid job,” he says. Microsoft is also likely to launch its own app store in 2025. But Neil points out that the Redmond giant’s mobile strategy has been “all over the place”, so he isn’t confident that either Epic or Microsoft can attract sufficient customer numbers, “even though the market desperately needs new contenders to rein in Apple and Google, who are utterly dominant.” We've seen Apple itself push new mobile hardware to gamers, including seeing more Triple-A game releases on iPad, such Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Mirage and Resident Evil 4 for iPhone. The mobile space is set to grow and become more important in 2025, and we've already seen both Unity and Unreal Engine 5.5 promote new tools for development on mobile platforms. There's a convergence happening with technology, as Unreal Engine and Unity become as useful outside of game development as within. We've seen in the past how Unreal us used to create immersive live experiences, such as Frameless in London that puts you into classic works of art and its use in filmmaking to drive LED Volume stages, the kind used by ILM for Star Wars. Just this month Felix & Paul Studios has announced a new 20,000-Square-Foot 'Interstellar Arc' mixed reality experience that will launch in Las Vegas in 2025 to rival the Las Vegas Sphere for tech and spectacle. This could lead to more virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality events launching in 2025, particularly as publishers look to leverage brands in new ways. Already an early contender to take your money, at least in the UK, is the upcoming Pac-Man Live experience that uses similar immersive tech as an Unreal Volume to out players into the Pac-Man maze as they're chased by augmented reality ghosts. Expect more immersive events in 2025 as gaming and game design evolves from the screen and into real life in new ways, especially with advances in AI like the Move AI's mocap 'Live' system that can capture movement and put it into scenes on a screen in real time. Sam Barlow notes that some of the biggest hits of the past year have relied on tried and tested design elements. “I mean, Metaphor: ReFantazio is pretty much literally a PS2 game in the way it’s set up,” he says, calling it “an extremely archaic RPG design” that is “extremely confident and polished in what it's doing”. He gives Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl as another example. “They're not even necessarily embracing a lot of the technical progress that's been made,” he says of the game that has dominated his recent playing time. “Stalker 2 is a 2000s PC game: it doesn't have cool, emergent physics, all the stuff that Zelda: Breath of the Wild did to innovate open world. It's not doing any of that. It's them going, ‘What if we made a 2000s PC game, but we can do 100 times as many trees?’.” Similarly, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, which shot past 4.5 million sales in a month is an old-fashioned Xbox 360-style shooter that simply refines classic ideas and reworks them for new players. Its success, and that of other old-school new releases, shows that players seem happy to embrace simpler game design, perhaps even as a form of nostalgia. It’s likely other studios will take note and follow suit in 2025. The wake of team downsizing and studio closures, and soaring development costs, combined with 'smaller' games performing well in 2024, a big game design trend for 2025 will see the return of well-made, polished, smaller-scale games made on sustainable budgets with a blend of AAA ambition and indie sensibilities. Likewise, publishers will look at the buzz around brand revivals like Silent Hill 2, Dragon Quest III HD-2D and Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and want to replicate those successes. We already have Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD and The Thing Remastered from remaster specials Nightdive Studios, so expect something special from Sony in particular. While it's clear Nintendo Switch 2, generative AI, new tools for Unreal Engine 5, the rise of indies and more will happen in 2025, there are some outside chances of other things happening in video games.

Title: Beef, milk supply TAINTED with new BlackRock-backed animal drug called Bovaer that claims to stop animal farts

Full Content:
Beef and dairy cattle are eating the drug, made by DSM-firmenich â BlackRock is a major shareholder in DSM-firmenich, by the way â as part of an effort by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) to decrease animal methane releases and thus cool planetary temperatures. The idea was hatched back in 2006. The FAO started fearmongering about cattle casting a "long shadow" with their flatulence, which comes out slightly warm and stinky much to the chagrin of the globalists who fear that the weather might get too hot if something is not done to cap those smelly fumes. A report issued at that time by the UN claimed that livestock is responsible for 18 percent of the world's greenhouse gases. It turns out this figure was pulled out of a bull's behind, so to speak. (Related: Did you hear that the FDA just approved a new drug called 3-NOP for dairy cattle that supposedly stops them from farting â but at what cost?) Animal farts are normal Dr. Frank Mitloehner, an air quality specialist in the Department of Animal Sciences at UC Davis, says the report and its claims are wildly flawed. And the FAO was later forced to admit that Mitloehner is right. "I must say honestly that he has a point," commented one of the study's authors about Mitloehner's discovery that the paper only looked at "the tailpipe emissions of cars" rather than conduct "a comprehensive life-cycle assessment." "We factored in everything for meat emissions, and we didn't do the same thing with transport â we just used the figure from the IPCC ..." The researchers now admit that while they did conduct a full life-cycle analysis on meat, taking into account both direct and indirect emissions, the only thing factored in as far as the transportation of meat is concerned was direct emissions, "leaving out activities like extracting fuel or the disposal of old cars." "While FAO researchers initially stuck with their 18 percent figure based on their confidence in what makes up total emissions worldwide, a subsequent FAO study calculated global livestock emissions slightly lower, at 14.5 percent." Mitloehner says that the way to create "less heat," if that is what the climate cultists are worried about, is to do "smarter animal farming, not less farming." "Producing less meat and milk will only mean more hunger in poor countries," he warns. It turns out that the original FAO report from 2006 that started all this does not even contain evidence to back the claim that the "livestock sector" is responsible for producing too many greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Much of the public confusion over the supposed role that meat and milk play in climate change is attributable to just two sentences in the report that are printed only in the executive summary and nowhere else in the body of the text: "The livestock sector is a major player, responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions measured in CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalents). This is a higher share than transport." Both of these sentences are factually wrong, and yet these false claims serve as the foundation of a decades-long quest by climate lunatics to stamp out animal flatulence and other natural processes that they strangely fear are going to destroy the planet. "Methane emitted by livestock is part of the biogenic carbon cycle, a natural process," Mitloehner says.

"We factored in everything for meat emissions, and we didn't do the same thing with transport â we just used the figure from the IPCC ..." The researchers now admit that while they did conduct a full life-cycle analysis on meat, taking into account both direct and indirect emissions, the only thing factored in as far as the transportation of meat is concerned was direct emissions, "leaving out activities like extracting fuel or the disposal of old cars." "While FAO researchers initially stuck with their 18 percent figure based on their confidence in what makes up total emissions worldwide, a subsequent FAO study calculated global livestock emissions slightly lower, at 14.5 percent." Mitloehner says that the way to create "less heat," if that is what the climate cultists are worried about, is to do "smarter animal farming, not less farming." "Producing less meat and milk will only mean more hunger in poor countries," he warns. It turns out that the original FAO report from 2006 that started all this does not even contain evidence to back the claim that the "livestock sector" is responsible for producing too many greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Much of the public confusion over the supposed role that meat and milk play in climate change is attributable to just two sentences in the report that are printed only in the executive summary and nowhere else in the body of the text: "The livestock sector is a major player, responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions measured in CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalents). This is a higher share than transport." Both of these sentences are factually wrong, and yet these false claims serve as the foundation of a decades-long quest by climate lunatics to stamp out animal flatulence and other natural processes that they strangely fear are going to destroy the planet. "Methane emitted by livestock is part of the biogenic carbon cycle, a natural process," Mitloehner says.

Against the backdrop of people raising concerns about high rents and a shortage of affordable housing to canvassing politicians in advance of last Friday’s general election, on the opposite end of the spectrum, Ireland’s super-prime residential market has been motoring on quietly and is showing no sign of slowing down. As the end of 2024 approaches, an examination of the Property Price Register (PPR) shows that approximately 1,235 sales have been completed nationally for sums of €1 million and above. The figure is roughly the same as that transacted until the end of November 2023 and over the same period in 2022. A further inspection of the register shows that approximately 202 sales with a value of €2 million and above were completed in Ireland in the 11-month period to the end of November, while 62 homes changed hands for at least €3 million, with the most valuable sale approaching €30 million. What follows are the top 10 residential sales by value this year. Where they appear on the register, the recorded figure reflects the amount paid for the principal residence and up to an acre of land. When a residential property sale includes more than an acre of land, the value of that extra land is not included on the register; we have marked the sale prices of these homes with an asterisk. A few miles upstream from Youghal in east Cork is Ballynatray House, a late Georgian estate set on 850 acres, located on a bend in the river Blackwater, which achieved €29.25 million, according to the PPR. It is understood to have been sold off-market last February, making it the most valuable transaction to have taken place in the Irish residential market so far this year. The PPR does not take into account the 850 acres of land included in the property, with some reports estimating the full sale price to be in the region of €32 million to €35 million. Situated where the river is at its most expansive, the 11-bay, two-storey-over-basement classical-style house is understood to have been bought by British vacuum-cleaner magnate, James Dyson. Ballynatray House was built between 1795 and 1797 on a symmetrical plan incorporating the fabric of an earlier house (built circa 1700), and includes ruins of an ancient abbey as well as estate houses. The property last came to market in March 2003, when it was purchased for over €11 million by property investor Henry Gwyn-Jones, along with 400 acres of land. Gwyn-Jones bought it from French aristocrats Serge and Henriette Boissevain, who had bought Ballynatray in 1995 when the then-1,000-acre estate sold for about £1.5 million. It is said the Boissevains entertained many of Europe’s best and brightest at the residence, including Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, known as Princess TNT, whom one local recalls being photographed on the lawns for a glossy fashion magazine. The grounds of Ballynatray House also featured in the 1975 Stanley Kubrick movie Barry Lyndon, which starred Ryan O’Neal. Censure House was launched to the market seeking €15 million in May, 2022. When it didn’t sell at that price, it is understood to have gone through a number of agents before being sold by Lisney for €10 million (17 per cent below its €12.5 million guide price) in March of this year, according to the PPR. It is a six-bedroom property extending to 1,365sq m (14,700sq ft), with a lift for simple transportation to all floors, and a self-contained one-bedroom apartment. The apartment was built on the site of an existing Regency villa, named Ceanchor House, which once belonged to the late socialite Jennifer Guinness. Nestled into the rock face, the property is sheltered from the elements by mature trees, while it maintains sea views to its south, east and west. It also abuts the cliff walk, so, despite the elevation, you can exit a gate and nip down the cliffs to take a dip in the sea at Jameson Beach, one of Howth’s few south-facing swimming spots, within a matter of minutes. Read our full review here A decade ago, when it last went on the market, Victoria House also made the list of the 10 most expensive house sales of the year. It was purchased for €4.41 million, according to the PPR, and has since been extensively remodelled and extended by its most recent owners. It was brought to market last April by Sherry FitzGerald, seeking €10 million – a sum which it achieved in September, according to the PPR. The vendors of the classic Victorian restored its coving, cornicing and ceiling roses and had engineers reinforce the feature staircase. They also engaged Bloom-gold-medal-winning landscape architect Jane McCorkell to reimagine the beautiful south-facing back garden. Set on the sunny side of this embassy belt road and extending to 550sq m (5,901sq ft), the six-bedroom residence backs on to the German ambassador’s residence, Danesfield, set on four acres. Read our full review here Melbeach was sold off-market deal by Inhous. Set over three floors, the six-bedroom house extends to about 743sq m (8,000 sq ft) with sea views from its kitchen, livingroom and diningroom. Daniel Lanois, who produced U2′s 1987 album, The Joshua Tree, alongside Brian Eno, told Hot Press in 2007 that Melbeach was where songs such as Mothers of the Disappeared and Bullet the Blue Sky were born, when it was owned by The Edge. Rarc An Ilan came to market in October 2023 seeking €8 million, and sold for €7.5 million (6 per cent below the guide price) last June, through Knight Frank, according to the PPR. Despite it looking like it has been in situ since Georgian times, the house dates from 1993 when it was purchased by accountant and businessman Howard Kilroy, whom Michael Smurfit described in his autobiography, A Life Worth Living, as “his long-time colleague”. It is understood Kilroy knocked an existing house and built this period-looking home of 318sq m (3,423sq ft) on the 0.6-acre site. Roscommon-based architectural firm Udo Humborg Associates was engaged to ensure original features, such as the old granite steps, lion’s heads and chimney pots, were reinstated. Along with maritime views, Rarc An Ilan offers direct access to the sea, where the water pools in the granite rocks. The new owner is understood to be a tech professional, and will find themself in good company in Dalkey, which Daft research found to be the area with the highest concentration of property millionaires as of 2018. Read our full review here One of the largest properties on Dublin 6′s Dartry Road, and once the childhood home of the late former taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, it is understood Lonsdale has been acquired in an off-market sale conducted by Inhous. Dating from 1884, the detached six-bedroom home, extending to 791sq m (8,514sq ft), is also one of the oldest holdings on the road. The granite-porticoed house comes with half an acre of gardens plus significant frontage to the road and includes an old coach and mews house. A fine example of the classical Victorian revival, it is fitting that the residence has been bought by the Italian embassy as the ambassador’s residence. “There was some domestic interest in the property but they weren’t coming up to the asking price,” says selling agent Barbara Carty. She says it is likely that events will be hosted there, pointing out that there is “half an acre to put up marquees”. Read more here Waverley is a seven-bedroom detached house on an acre of impressive gardens, which came to market seeking €8.45 million in April 2023 through Sherry FitzGerald. It then sold for €7.255 million last July, according to the PPR, 14 per cent below the asking price. Designed for entertaining, and previously rented as an embassy residence, one can picture pyramids of Ferrero Rocher being served while those gathered sip cocktails and explore the vast house and stylish grounds. The vendors bought the premises in the middle of the property boom in 2005 for €7.2 million, then set about completely revamping it: “We kept one or two things,” they told The Irish Times – the double-height nine-panelled front window with a sandstone surround and the portico leading to the front door, for example. But they changed much of the rest of the house, working with architectural firm Frank Ennis & Associates and designer Suzanne Roche. Built in 1999 to look like a stately period home, the completely modern house extends to 698sq m (7513sq ft), has B1 Ber, triple-glazed windows, geothermal central heating and underfloor heating on the ground and first floors. A balcony off the principal bedroom overlooks the back garden and beyond it, Foxrock golf club, on to which the property backs. It has a 46sq m (500sq ft) well-equipped home gym in the building at the bottom of the garden as well as a detached executive office. The garden of Waverley was designed first by Diarmuid Gavin and later by Paul Doyle. It is tended to twice a week by a gardener. Read our full review here Lansdowne Place in Dublin 4 continues to attract buyers with deep pockets. The highest-value sale at the scheme was recorded at €7 million in 2023, with the second most expensive unit, 21 The Templeton – a seventh-floor, three-bedroom penthouse – selling for €6.6 million through joint agents Sherry FitzGerald New Homes and Savills in May this year. The penthouse’s new owner will enjoy floor-to-ceiling vistas of the city in a vast space that extends to 320sq m (3,454sq ft) and includes a terrace of 17sq m (189sq ft), big enough to fit a table for 12. However, it is the further 174sq m (1,879sq ft) of roof terrace above that deliver wow-factor views to the mountains and sea. The owner may even bump into high-profile fellow residents of the scheme, such as pop star Rod Stewart or former Republic of Ireland and Manchester United captain Roy Keane. Read more here Number 3 Churchfields at the K Club is a five-bedroom detached Regency-style residence, extending to 582sq m (6,246sq ft), that was constructed in the late 1990s. The property also contains a detached garage and an annexe which is currently used as a gym studio. It was sold in September for €6 million, according to the PPR, in an off-market deal. It is understood John Bosco French of French Estates advised on the deal. Originally owned by the late racehorse trainer Vincent O’Brien and his wife, Jacqueline, the house may be familiar to hawk-eyed analysts of the PPR as it is listed as having sold for €2.3 million in May 2017 and again for €2.825m in December 2020, and has since been extensively refurbished. Rathbeale Hall in Swords sold for €5.875m in April, according to the PPR. The property is listed on the National Built Heritage Service website as one of architectural, archaeological and artistic note. Dating from about 1680, the detached five-bay, three-storey-over-basement pile was remodelled in 1750 to incorporate a Palladian facade along with flanking wings of two storeys each. It was further extended in 1850 to include a two-storey kitchen block. Kilree Estate, Kilree, Co Kilkenny. (On 535 acres.) Sale price: €1.2m*. Agent: Savills. Property including land understood to have sold for €7.75m. Killough Castle and Farm, Thurles, Co Tipperary. (On 527 acres.) Sale price: €505,000*. Agent: Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes. Property including land understood to have sold for in excess of €6.39m asking price. Tullyard House and Farm, Trim, Co. Meath. (On 189 acres.) Sale price: €900,000*. Agent: Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes. Property including land understood to have sold for slightly under €3.85m asking price. Rathduff Stud, Golden, Cashel, Co Tipperary. (On 95 acres.) Sale price: €850,000*. Agent: Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes. Property including land understood to have sold for €2.675m at auction. Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes reports the sale of Dowth Hall on 11 acres in Co Meath, which it says closed in January 2024, at a price of €11m. The sale has yet to appear on the PPR. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Godot Isn't Making it

Full Content:
Before we get going — please enjoy my speech from Web Summit, Why Are All Tech Products Now Shit? I didn’t write the title. I have been warning you for the best part of a year that generative AI has no killer apps and had no way of justifying its valuations (February), that generative AI had already peaked (March), and I have pleaded with people to consider an eventuality where the jump from GPT-4 to GPT-5 was not significant, in part due to a lack of training data (April). I shared concerns in July that the transformer-based-architecture underpinning generative AI was a dead end, and that there were few ways we'd progress past the products we'd already seen, in part due to both the limits of training data and the limits of models that use said training data. In August, I summarized the Pale Horses of the AI Apocalypse — events, many that have since come to pass, that would signify that the end is indeed nigh — and again added that GPT-5 would likely "not change the game enough to matter, let alone [add] a new architecture to build future (and more capable) models on." Throughout these pieces I have repeatedly made the point that — separate to any lack of a core value proposition, training data drought, or unsustainable economics — generative AI is a dead end due to the limitations of probabilistic models that hallucinate, where they authoritatively state things that aren't true. The hallucination problem is one that is nowhere closer to being solved — and, at least with the current technology — may never go away, and it makes it a non-starter for a great many business tasks, where you need a high level of reliability. I have — since March — expressed great dismay about the credulousness of the media in their acceptance of the "inevitable" ways in which generative AI will change society, despite a lack of any truly meaningful product that might justify an environmentally-destructive industry led by a company that burns more than $5 billion a year and big tech firms spending $200 billion on data centers for products that people don't want. The reason I'm repeating myself is that it's important to note how obvious the problems with generative AI have been, and for how long. And you're going to need context for everything I'm about to throw at you. A few weeks ago, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are struggling to build more advanced AI, and that OpenAI's "Orion" model — otherwise known as GPT-5 — "did not hit the company's desired performance," and that "Orion is so far not considered to be as big a step up" as it was from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, its current model. You'll be shocked to hear the reason is that because "it’s become increasingly difficult to find new, untapped sources of high-quality, human-made training data that can be used to build more advanced AI systems," something I said would happen in March, while also adding that the "AGI bubble is bursting a little bit," something I said more forcefully in July. I also want to stop and stare daggers at one particular point: The only people taking this as "gospel" have been members of the media unwilling to ask the tough questions and AI founders that don't know what the fuck they're talking about (or that intend to mislead). Generative AI's products have effectively been trapped in amber for over a year. There have been no meaningful, industry-defining products, because, as economist Daron Acemoglu said back in May, "more powerful" models do not unlock new features, or really change the experience, nor what you can build with transformer-based models. Or, put another way, a slightly better white elephant is still a white elephant. Despite the billions of dollars burned and thousands of glossy headlines, it's difficult to point to any truly important generative-AI-powered product. Even Apple Intelligence, the only thing that Apple really had to add to the latest iPhone, is utterly dull, and largely based on on-device models. Yes, there are people that use ChatGPT — 200 million of them a week, allegedly, losing the company money with every prompt — but there is little to suggest that there's widespread adoption of actual generative AI software. The Information reported in September that between 0.1% and 1% of the 440 million of Microsoft's business customers were paying for its AI-powered Copilot, and in late October, Microsoft claimed that "AI is on pace to be a $10 billion-a-year business," which sounds good until you consider a few things: I must be clear that every single one of these investments and products has been hyped with the whisper that they would get exponentially better over time, and that eventually the $200 billion in capital expenditures would spit out remarkable productivity improvements and fascinating new products that consumers and enterprises would buy in droves. Instead, big tech has found itself peddling increasingly-more-expensive iterations of near-identical Large Language Models — a direct result of them all having to use the same training data, which it’s now running out of. The other assumption — those so-called scaling laws — has been that by simply building bigger data centers with more GPUs (the expensive, power-hungry graphics processing units used to both run and train these models) and throwing as much training data at them as possible, they'd simply start sprouting new capabilities, despite there being little proof that they'd do so. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google have all burned billions on the assumption that doing so would create something — be it a human-level "artificial general intelligence" or, I dunno, a product that would justify the costs — and it's become painfully obvious that it isn't going to work. As we speak, outlets are already desperate to try and prove that this isn't a problem. The Information, in a similar story to Bloomberg's, attempted to put lipstick on the pig of generative AI, framing the lack of meaningful progress with GPT-5 as fine, because OpenAI can combine its GPT-5 Model with its o-1 "reasoning" model, which will then do something of some sort, such as "write a lot more very difficult code" according to OpenAI CEO and career liar Sam Altman, who intimated that GPT-5 may function like a "virtual brain" in May. Chief Valley Cheerleader Casey Newton wrote on Platformer last week that diminishing returns in training models "may not matter as much as you would guess," with his evidence being that Anthropic, who he claims "has not been prone to hyperbole," do not think that scaling laws are ending. To be clear, in a 14,000 op-ed that Newton wrote two pieces about, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that "AI-accelerated neuroscience is likely to vastly improve treatments for, or even cure, most mental illness," the kind of hyperbole that should have you tarred and feathered in public. So, let me summarize: The entire tech industry has become oriented around a dead-end technology that requires burning billions of dollars to provide inessential products that cost them more money to serve than anybody would ever pay. Their big strategy was to throw even more money at the problem until one of these transformer-based models created a new, more useful product — despite the fact that every iteration of GPT and other models has been, well, iterative. There has never been any proof (other than benchmarks that are increasingly easier to game) that GPT or other models would become conscious, nor that these models would do more than they do today, or three months ago, or even a year ago. Yet things can, believe it or not, get worse. The AI boom helped the S&P 500 hit record high levels in 2024, largely thanks to chip giant NVIDIA, a company that makes both the GPUs necessary to train and run generative AI models and the software architecture behind them. Part of NVIDIA's remarkable growth has been its ability to capitalize on the CUDA architecture — the software layer that lets you do complex computing with GPUs, rather than simply use them to render video games in increasingly higher resolution — and, of course, continually create new GPUs to sell for tens of thousands of dollars to tech companies that want to burn billions of dollars on generative AI, leading the company's stock to pop more than 179% over the last year. Back in May, NVIDIA CEO and professional carnival barker Jensen Huang said that the company was now "on a one-year rhythm" in AI GPU production, with its latest "Blackwell" GPUs (specifically the B100, B200 and GB200 models used for generative AI) supposedly due at the end of 2024, but are now delayed until at least March 2025.Before we go any further, it's worth noting that when I say "GPU," I don't mean the one you'd find in a gaming PC, but a much larger chip put in a specialized server with multiple other GPUs, all integrated with specialized casing, cooling, and networking infrastructure. In simple terms, the things necessary to make sure all these chips work together efficiently, and also stop them from overheating, because they get extremely hot and are running at full speed, all the time. The initial delay of the new Blackwell chips was caused by a (now-fixed) design flaw in production, but as I've suggested above, the problem isn't just creating the chips — it's making sure they actually work, at scale, for the jobs they're bought for. But what if that, too, wasn't possible? A few days ago, The Information reported that NVIDIA is grappling with the oldest problem in computing — how to cool the fucking things. According to the report, NVIDIA has been asking suppliers to change the design of its 3,000-pound, 75-GPU server racks "several times" to overcome overheating problems, which The Information calls "the most complicated design NVIDIA had ever come up with." According to the report, a few months after revealing the racks, engineers found that they...didn't work properly, even with Nvidia’s smaller 36-chip racks, and have been scrambling to fix it ever since. While one can dazzle investors with buzzwords and charts, the laws of physics are a far harsher mistress, and if NVIDIA is struggling mere months before the first installations are to begin, it's unclear how it practically launches this generation of chips, let alone continues its yearly cadence. The Information reports that these changes have been made late in the production process, which is scaring customers that desperately need them so that their models can continue to do something they'll work out later. To quote The Information: The fact that NVIDIA is having such significant difficulties with thermal performance is very, very bad. These chips are incredibly expensive — as much as $70,000 a piece — and will be running, as I've mentioned, at full speed, generating an incredible amount of heat that must be dissipated, while sat next to anywhere from 35 to 71 other chips, which will in turn be densely packed so that you can cram more servers into a data center. New, more powerful chips require entirely new methods to rack-mount, operate and cool them, and all of these parts must operate in sync, as overheating GPUs will die. While these units are big, some of their internal components are microscopic in size, and unless properly cooled, their circuits will start to crumble when roasted by a guy typing "Garfield with Gun" into ChatGPT. Remember, Blackwell is supposed to represent a major leap forward in performance. If NVIDIA doesn’t solve its cooling problem — and solve it well — its customers will undoubtedly encounter thermal throttling, where the chip reduces speed in order to avoid causing permanent damage. It could eliminate any performance gains obtained from the new architecture and new manufacturing process, despite costing much, much more than its predecessor. NVIDIA's problem isn't just bringing these thermal performance issues under control, but both keeping them under control and being able to educate their customers on how to do so. NVIDIA has, according to The Information, repeatedly tried to influence its customers' server integrations to follow its designs because it thinks it will "lead to better performance," but in this case, one has to worry if NVIDIA's Blackwell chips can be reliably cooled. While NVIDIA might be able to fix this problem in isolation within its racks, it remains to be seen how this works at scale as they ship and integrate hundreds of thousands of Blackwell GPUs starting in the front half of 2025. Things also get a little worse when you realize how these chips are being installed — in giant “supercomputer” data centers where tens of thousands, or as many as a hundred thousand in the case of Elon Musk’s “colossus” data center — of GPUs run in concert to power generative AI models. The Wall Street Journal reported a few weeks ago that building these vast data centers creates entirely new engineering challenges, with one expert saying that big tech companies could be using as much as half of their capital expenditures on replacing parts that have broken down, in large part because these clusters are running their GPUs at full speed, at all times. Remember, the capital expenditures on generative AI and the associated infrastructure have gone over $200 billion in the last year. If half of that’s dedicated to replacing broken gear, what happens when there’s no path to profitability? In any case, NVIDIA doesn’t care. It’s already made billions of dollars selling Blackwell GPUs — they're sold out for a year, after all — and will continue to do so for now, but any manufacturing or cooling issues will likely be costly. And even then, at some point somebody has to ask the question: why do we need all these GPUs if we've reached peak AI? Despite the remarkable "power" of these chips, NVIDIA's entire enterprise GPU business model centers around the idea that throwing more power at these problems will finally create some solutions. What if that isn't the case? The tech industry is over-leveraged, having doubled, tripled, quadrupled down on generative AI — a technology that doesn't do much more than it did a few months ago and won't do much more than it can do now. Every single big tech company has piled tens of billions of dollars into building out massive data centers with the intent of "capturing AI demand," yet never seemed to think whether they were actually building things that people wanted, or would pay for, or would somehow make the company money. While some have claimed that "agents are the next frontier," the reality is that agents may be the last generative AI product — multiple Large Language Models and integrations bouncing off of each other in an attempt to simulate what a human might do at a cost that won't be sustainable for the majority of businesses. While Anthropic's demo of its model allegedly controlling a few browser windows with a prompt might have seemed impressive to credulous people like Casey Newton, these were controlled demos which Anthropic added were "slow" and "made lots of mistakes." Hey, almost like it's hallucinating! I sure hope they fix that totally unfixable problem. Even if it does, Anthropic has now successfully replaced...an entry-level data worker position at an indeterminate and likely unprofitable price. And in many organizations, those jobs had already been outsourced, or automated, or staffed with cheaper contractors. The obscenity of this mass delusion is nauseating — a monolith to bad decision-making and the herd mentality of tech's most powerful people, as well as an outright attempt to manipulate the media into believing something was possible that wasn't. And the media bought it, hook, line, and sinker. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been wasted building giant data centers to crunch numbers for software that has no real product-market fit, all while trying to hammer it into various shapes to make it pretend that it's alive, conscious, or even a useful product. There is no path, from what I can see, to turn generative AI and its associated products into anything resembling sustainable businesses, and the only path that big tech appeared to have was to throw as much money, power, and data at the problem as possible, an avenue that appears to be another dead end. And worse still, nothing has really come out of this movement. I've used a handful of AI products that I've found useful — an AI powered journal, for example — but these are not the products that one associates with "revolutions," but useful tools that would have been a welcome surprise if they didn't require burning billions of dollars, blowing past emissions targets and stealing the creative works of millions of people to train them. I truly don't know what happens next, but I'll walk you through what I'm thinking. If we're truly at the diminishing returns stage of transformer-based models, it will be extremely difficult to justify buying further iterations of NVIDIA GPUs past Blackwell. The entire generative AI movement lives and dies by the idea that more compute power and more training data makes these things better, and if that's no longer the case, there's little reason to keep buying bigger and better. After all, what's the point? Even now, what exactly happens when Microsoft or Google has racks-worth of Blackwell GPUs? The models aren't going to get better. This also makes the lives of OpenAI and Anthropic that much more difficult. Sam Altman has grown rich and powerful lying about how GPT will somehow lead to AGI, but at this point, what exactly is OpenAI meant to do? The only way it’s ever been able to develop new models is by throwing masses of compute and training data at the problem, and its only other choice is to start stapling its reasoning model onto its main Large Language Model, at which point something happens, something so good that literally nobody working for OpenAI or in the media appears to be able to tell you what it is. Putting that aside, OpenAI is also a terrible business that has to burn $5 billion to make $3.4 billion, with no proof that it’s capable of bringing down costs. The constant refrain I hear from VCs and AI fantasists is that "chips will bring down the cost of inference," yet I don't see any proof of that happening, nor do I think it'll happen quickly enough for these companies to turn things around. And you can feel the desperation, too. OpenAI is reportedly looking at ads as a means to narrow the gap between its revenues and losses. As I pointed out in Burst Damage, introducing an advertising revenue stream would require significant upfront investment, both in terms of technology and talent. OpenAI would need a way to target ads, and a team to sell advertising — or, instead, use a third-party ad network that would take a significant bite out of its revenue. It’s unclear how much OpenAI could charge advertisers, or what percentage of its reported 200 million weekly users have an ad-blocker installed. Or, for that matter, whether ads would provide a perverse incentive for OpenAI to enshittify an already unreliable product. Facebook and Google — as I’ve previously noted — have made their products manifestly worse in order to increase the amount of time people spend on their sites, and thus, the number of ads they see. In the case of Facebook, it buried your newsfeed under a deluge of AI-generated sludge and “recommended content.” Google, meanwhile, has progressively degraded the quality of its search results in order to increase the volume of queries it received as a means of making sure users saw more ads. OpenAI could, just as easily, fall into the same temptation. Most people who use ChatGPT are trying to accomplish a specific task — like writing a term paper, or researching a topic, or whatever — and then they leave. And so, the amount of ads they’d conceivably see each will undoubtedly be comparatively low compared to a social network or search engine. Would OpenAI try to get users to stick around longer — to write more prompts — by crippling the performance of its models? Even if OpenAI listens to its better angels, the reality still stands: ads won’t dam the rising tide of red ink that promises to eventually drown the company. This is a truly dismal situation where the only options are to stop now, or continue burning money until the heat gets too much. It cost $100 million to train GPT-4o, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei estimated a few months ago that training future models will cost $1 billion to $10 billion, with one researcher claiming that training OpenAI's GPT-5 will cost around $1 billion. And that’s before mentioning any, to quote a Rumsfeldism, “unknown unknowns.” Trump’s election, at the risk of sounding like a cliché, changes everything and in ways we don’t yet fully understand. According to the Wall Street Journal, Musk has successfully ingratiated himself with Trump, thanks to his early and full-throated support of his campaign. He’s now reportedly living in Mar a Lago, sitting on calls with world leaders, and whispering in Trump’s ear as he builds his cabinet. And, as The Journal claims, his enemies fear that he could use his position of influence to harm them or their businesses — chiefly Sam Altman, who is “persona non grata” in Musk’s world, largely due to the new for-profit direction of OpenAI. While it’s likely that these companies will fail due to inevitable organic realities (like running out of money, or not having a product that generates a profit), Musk’s enemies must now contend with a new enemy — one with the full backing of the Federal government, and that neither forgives nor forgets. And, crucially, one that’s not afraid to bend ethical or moral laws to further his own interests — or to inflict pain on those perceived as having slighted him. Even if Musk doesn’t use his newfound political might to hurt Altman and OpenAI, he could still pursue the company as a private citizen. Last Friday, he filed an injunction requesting a halt to OpenAI’s transformation from an ostensible non-profit to a for-profit business. Even if he ultimately fails, should Musk manage to drag the process out, or delay it temporarily, it could strike a terminal blow for OpenAI. That’s because in its most recent fundraise, OpenAI agreed that it would convert its recent $6.6bn equity investment into high-interest debt, should it fail to successfully convert into a for-profit business within a two-year period. This was a tight deadline to begin with, and it can’t afford any delays. The interest payments on that debt would massively increase its cash burn, and it would undoubtedly find it hard to obtain further outside investment. Outside of a miracle, we are about to enter an era of desperation in the generative AI space. We're two years in, and we have no killer apps — no industry-defining products — other than ChatGPT, a product that burns billions of dollars and nobody can really describe. Neither Microsoft, nor Meta, nor Google or Amazon seem to be able to come up with a profitable use case, let alone one their users actually like, nor have any of the people that have raised billions of dollars in venture capital for anything with "AI" taped to the side — and investor interest in AI is cooling. It's unclear how much further this farce continues, if only because it isn't obvious what it is that anybody gets by investing in future rounds in OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other generative AI company. At some point they must make money, and the entire dream has been built around the idea that all of these GPUs and all of this money would eventually spit out something revolutionary. Yet what we have is clunky, ugly, messy, larcenous, environmentally-destructive and mediocre. Generative AI was a reckless pursuit, one that shows a total lack of creativity and sense in the minds of big tech and venture capital, one where there was never anything really impressive other than the amount of money it could burn and the amount of times Sam Altman could say something stupid and get quoted for it. I'll be honest with you, I have no idea what happens here. The future was always one that demanded that big tech spent more to make even bigger models that would at some point become useful, and that isn't happening. In pursuit of doing so, big tech invested hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure specifically to follow one goal, and put AI front and center at their businesses, claiming it was the future without ever considering what they'd do if it wasn't. The revenue isn't coming. The products aren't coming. "Orion," OpenAI's next model, will underwhelm, as will its competitors' models, and at some point somebody is going to blink in one of the hyperscalers, and the AI era will be over. Almost every single generative AI company that you’ve heard of is deeply unprofitable, and there are few innovations coming to save them from the atrophy of the foundation models. I feel sad and exhausted as I write this, drained as I look at the many times I’ve tried to warn people, frustrated at the many members of the media that failed to push back against the overpromises and outright lies of people like Sam Altman, and full of dread as I consider the economic ramifications of this industry collapsing. Once the AI bubble pops, there are no other hyper-growth markets left, which will in turn lead to a bloodbath in big tech stocks as they realize that they’re out of big ideas to convince the street that they’re going to grow forever. There are some that will boast about “being right” here, and yes, there is some satisfaction in being so. Nevertheless, knowing that the result of this bubble bursting will be massive layoffs, a dearth in venture capital funding, and a much more fragile tech ecosystem. I’ll end with a quote from Bubble Trouble, a piece I wrote in April: I was right then and I’m right now. Generative AI isn’t a revolution, it’s an evolution of a tech industry overtaken by growth-hungry management consultant types that neither know the problems that real people face nor how to fix them. It’s a sickening waste, a monument to the corrupting force of growth, and a sign that the people in power no longer work for you, the customer, but for the venture capitalists and the markets. I also want to be clear that none of these companies ever had a plan. They believed that if they threw enough GPUs together they would turn generative AI – probabilistic models for generating stuff — into some sort of sentient computer. It’s much easier, and more comfortable, to look at the world as a series of conspiracies and grand strategies, and far scarier to see it for what it is — extremely rich and powerful people that are willing to bet insanely large amounts of money on what amounts to a few PDFs and their gut. This is not big tech’s big plan to excuse building more data centers — it’s the death throes of twenty years of growth-at-all-costs thinking, because throwing a bunch of money at more servers and more engineers always seemed to create more growth. In practice, this means that the people in charge and the strategies they employ are borne not of an interest in improving the lives of their customers, but in increasing revenue growth, which means the products they create aren’t really about solving any problem other than “what will make somebody give me more money,” which doesn’t necessarily mean “provide them with a service.” Generative AI is the perfect monster of the Rot Economy — a technology that lacks any real purpose sold as if it could do literally anything, one without a real business model or killer app, proliferated because big tech no longer innovates, but rather clones and monopolizes. Yes, this much money can be this stupid, and yes, they will burn billions in pursuit of a non-specific dream that involves charging you money and trapping you in their ecosystem. I’m not trying to be a doomsayer, just like I wasn’t trying to be one in March. I believe all of this is going nowhere, and that at some point Google, Microsoft, or Meta is going to blink and pull back on their capital expenditures. And before then, you’re going to get a lot of desperate stories about how “AI gains can be found outside of training new models” to try and keep the party going, despite reality flicking the lights on and off and threatening to call the police. I fear for the future for many reasons, but I always have hope, because I believe that there are still good people in the tech industry and that customers are seeing the light. Bluesky feels different — growing rapidly, competing with both Threads and Twitter, all while selling an honest product and an open protocol. There are other ideas for the future that aren’t borne of the scuzzy mindset of billionaire shitheels like Sundar Pichai and Sam Altman, and they can — and will — grow out of the ruins created by these kleptocrats.

Full Content:
Before we get going — please enjoy my speech from Web Summit, Why Are All Tech Products Now Shit? I didn’t write the title. I have been warning you for the best part of a year that generative AI has no killer apps and had no way of justifying its valuations (February), that generative AI had already peaked (March), and I have pleaded with people to consider an eventuality where the jump from GPT-4 to GPT-5 was not significant, in part due to a lack of training data (April). I shared concerns in July that the transformer-based-architecture underpinning generative AI was a dead end, and that there were few ways we'd progress past the products we'd already seen, in part due to both the limits of training data and the limits of models that use said training data. In August, I summarized the Pale Horses of the AI Apocalypse — events, many that have since come to pass, that would signify that the end is indeed nigh — and again added that GPT-5 would likely "not change the game enough to matter, let alone [add] a new architecture to build future (and more capable) models on." Throughout these pieces I have repeatedly made the point that — separate to any lack of a core value proposition, training data drought, or unsustainable economics — generative AI is a dead end due to the limitations of probabilistic models that hallucinate, where they authoritatively state things that aren't true. The hallucination problem is one that is nowhere closer to being solved — and, at least with the current technology — may never go away, and it makes it a non-starter for a great many business tasks, where you need a high level of reliability. I have — since March — expressed great dismay about the credulousness of the media in their acceptance of the "inevitable" ways in which generative AI will change society, despite a lack of any truly meaningful product that might justify an environmentally-destructive industry led by a company that burns more than $5 billion a year and big tech firms spending $200 billion on data centers for products that people don't want. The reason I'm repeating myself is that it's important to note how obvious the problems with generative AI have been, and for how long. And you're going to need context for everything I'm about to throw at you. A few weeks ago, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are struggling to build more advanced AI, and that OpenAI's "Orion" model — otherwise known as GPT-5 — "did not hit the company's desired performance," and that "Orion is so far not considered to be as big a step up" as it was from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, its current model. You'll be shocked to hear the reason is that because "it’s become increasingly difficult to find new, untapped sources of high-quality, human-made training data that can be used to build more advanced AI systems," something I said would happen in March, while also adding that the "AGI bubble is bursting a little bit," something I said more forcefully in July. I also want to stop and stare daggers at one particular point: The only people taking this as "gospel" have been members of the media unwilling to ask the tough questions and AI founders that don't know what the fuck they're talking about (or that intend to mislead). Generative AI's products have effectively been trapped in amber for over a year. There have been no meaningful, industry-defining products, because, as economist Daron Acemoglu said back in May, "more powerful" models do not unlock new features, or really change the experience, nor what you can build with transformer-based models. Or, put another way, a slightly better white elephant is still a white elephant. Despite the billions of dollars burned and thousands of glossy headlines, it's difficult to point to any truly important generative-AI-powered product. Even Apple Intelligence, the only thing that Apple really had to add to the latest iPhone, is utterly dull, and largely based on on-device models. Yes, there are people that use ChatGPT — 200 million of them a week, allegedly, losing the company money with every prompt — but there is little to suggest that there's widespread adoption of actual generative AI software. The Information reported in September that between 0.1% and 1% of the 440 million of Microsoft's business customers were paying for its AI-powered Copilot, and in late October, Microsoft claimed that "AI is on pace to be a $10 billion-a-year business," which sounds good until you consider a few things: I must be clear that every single one of these investments and products has been hyped with the whisper that they would get exponentially better over time, and that eventually the $200 billion in capital expenditures would spit out remarkable productivity improvements and fascinating new products that consumers and enterprises would buy in droves. Instead, big tech has found itself peddling increasingly-more-expensive iterations of near-identical Large Language Models — a direct result of them all having to use the same training data, which it’s now running out of. The other assumption — those so-called scaling laws — has been that by simply building bigger data centers with more GPUs (the expensive, power-hungry graphics processing units used to both run and train these models) and throwing as much training data at them as possible, they'd simply start sprouting new capabilities, despite there being little proof that they'd do so. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google have all burned billions on the assumption that doing so would create something — be it a human-level "artificial general intelligence" or, I dunno, a product that would justify the costs — and it's become painfully obvious that it isn't going to work. As we speak, outlets are already desperate to try and prove that this isn't a problem. The Information, in a similar story to Bloomberg's, attempted to put lipstick on the pig of generative AI, framing the lack of meaningful progress with GPT-5 as fine, because OpenAI can combine its GPT-5 Model with its o-1 "reasoning" model, which will then do something of some sort, such as "write a lot more very difficult code" according to OpenAI CEO and career liar Sam Altman, who intimated that GPT-5 may function like a "virtual brain" in May. Chief Valley Cheerleader Casey Newton wrote on Platformer last week that diminishing returns in training models "may not matter as much as you would guess," with his evidence being that Anthropic, who he claims "has not been prone to hyperbole," do not think that scaling laws are ending. To be clear, in a 14,000 op-ed that Newton wrote two pieces about, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that "AI-accelerated neuroscience is likely to vastly improve treatments for, or even cure, most mental illness," the kind of hyperbole that should have you tarred and feathered in public. So, let me summarize: The entire tech industry has become oriented around a dead-end technology that requires burning billions of dollars to provide inessential products that cost them more money to serve than anybody would ever pay. Their big strategy was to throw even more money at the problem until one of these transformer-based models created a new, more useful product — despite the fact that every iteration of GPT and other models has been, well, iterative. There has never been any proof (other than benchmarks that are increasingly easier to game) that GPT or other models would become conscious, nor that these models would do more than they do today, or three months ago, or even a year ago. Yet things can, believe it or not, get worse. The AI boom helped the S&P 500 hit record high levels in 2024, largely thanks to chip giant NVIDIA, a company that makes both the GPUs necessary to train and run generative AI models and the software architecture behind them. Part of NVIDIA's remarkable growth has been its ability to capitalize on the CUDA architecture — the software layer that lets you do complex computing with GPUs, rather than simply use them to render video games in increasingly higher resolution — and, of course, continually create new GPUs to sell for tens of thousands of dollars to tech companies that want to burn billions of dollars on generative AI, leading the company's stock to pop more than 179% over the last year. Back in May, NVIDIA CEO and professional carnival barker Jensen Huang said that the company was now "on a one-year rhythm" in AI GPU production, with its latest "Blackwell" GPUs (specifically the B100, B200 and GB200 models used for generative AI) supposedly due at the end of 2024, but are now delayed until at least March 2025.Before we go any further, it's worth noting that when I say "GPU," I don't mean the one you'd find in a gaming PC, but a much larger chip put in a specialized server with multiple other GPUs, all integrated with specialized casing, cooling, and networking infrastructure. In simple terms, the things necessary to make sure all these chips work together efficiently, and also stop them from overheating, because they get extremely hot and are running at full speed, all the time. The initial delay of the new Blackwell chips was caused by a (now-fixed) design flaw in production, but as I've suggested above, the problem isn't just creating the chips — it's making sure they actually work, at scale, for the jobs they're bought for. But what if that, too, wasn't possible? A few days ago, The Information reported that NVIDIA is grappling with the oldest problem in computing — how to cool the fucking things. According to the report, NVIDIA has been asking suppliers to change the design of its 3,000-pound, 75-GPU server racks "several times" to overcome overheating problems, which The Information calls "the most complicated design NVIDIA had ever come up with." According to the report, a few months after revealing the racks, engineers found that they...didn't work properly, even with Nvidia’s smaller 36-chip racks, and have been scrambling to fix it ever since. While one can dazzle investors with buzzwords and charts, the laws of physics are a far harsher mistress, and if NVIDIA is struggling mere months before the first installations are to begin, it's unclear how it practically launches this generation of chips, let alone continues its yearly cadence. The Information reports that these changes have been made late in the production process, which is scaring customers that desperately need them so that their models can continue to do something they'll work out later. To quote The Information: The fact that NVIDIA is having such significant difficulties with thermal performance is very, very bad. These chips are incredibly expensive — as much as $70,000 a piece — and will be running, as I've mentioned, at full speed, generating an incredible amount of heat that must be dissipated, while sat next to anywhere from 35 to 71 other chips, which will in turn be densely packed so that you can cram more servers into a data center. New, more powerful chips require entirely new methods to rack-mount, operate and cool them, and all of these parts must operate in sync, as overheating GPUs will die. While these units are big, some of their internal components are microscopic in size, and unless properly cooled, their circuits will start to crumble when roasted by a guy typing "Garfield with Gun" into ChatGPT. Remember, Blackwell is supposed to represent a major leap forward in performance. If NVIDIA doesn’t solve its cooling problem — and solve it well — its customers will undoubtedly encounter thermal throttling, where the chip reduces speed in order to avoid causing permanent damage. It could eliminate any performance gains obtained from the new architecture and new manufacturing process, despite costing much, much more than its predecessor. NVIDIA's problem isn't just bringing these thermal performance issues under control, but both keeping them under control and being able to educate their customers on how to do so. NVIDIA has, according to The Information, repeatedly tried to influence its customers' server integrations to follow its designs because it thinks it will "lead to better performance," but in this case, one has to worry if NVIDIA's Blackwell chips can be reliably cooled. While NVIDIA might be able to fix this problem in isolation within its racks, it remains to be seen how this works at scale as they ship and integrate hundreds of thousands of Blackwell GPUs starting in the front half of 2025. Things also get a little worse when you realize how these chips are being installed — in giant “supercomputer” data centers where tens of thousands, or as many as a hundred thousand in the case of Elon Musk’s “colossus” data center — of GPUs run in concert to power generative AI models. The Wall Street Journal reported a few weeks ago that building these vast data centers creates entirely new engineering challenges, with one expert saying that big tech companies could be using as much as half of their capital expenditures on replacing parts that have broken down, in large part because these clusters are running their GPUs at full speed, at all times. Remember, the capital expenditures on generative AI and the associated infrastructure have gone over $200 billion in the last year. If half of that’s dedicated to replacing broken gear, what happens when there’s no path to profitability? In any case, NVIDIA doesn’t care. It’s already made billions of dollars selling Blackwell GPUs — they're sold out for a year, after all — and will continue to do so for now, but any manufacturing or cooling issues will likely be costly. And even then, at some point somebody has to ask the question: why do we need all these GPUs if we've reached peak AI? Despite the remarkable "power" of these chips, NVIDIA's entire enterprise GPU business model centers around the idea that throwing more power at these problems will finally create some solutions. What if that isn't the case? The tech industry is over-leveraged, having doubled, tripled, quadrupled down on generative AI — a technology that doesn't do much more than it did a few months ago and won't do much more than it can do now. Every single big tech company has piled tens of billions of dollars into building out massive data centers with the intent of "capturing AI demand," yet never seemed to think whether they were actually building things that people wanted, or would pay for, or would somehow make the company money. While some have claimed that "agents are the next frontier," the reality is that agents may be the last generative AI product — multiple Large Language Models and integrations bouncing off of each other in an attempt to simulate what a human might do at a cost that won't be sustainable for the majority of businesses. While Anthropic's demo of its model allegedly controlling a few browser windows with a prompt might have seemed impressive to credulous people like Casey Newton, these were controlled demos which Anthropic added were "slow" and "made lots of mistakes." Hey, almost like it's hallucinating! I sure hope they fix that totally unfixable problem. Even if it does, Anthropic has now successfully replaced...an entry-level data worker position at an indeterminate and likely unprofitable price. And in many organizations, those jobs had already been outsourced, or automated, or staffed with cheaper contractors. The obscenity of this mass delusion is nauseating — a monolith to bad decision-making and the herd mentality of tech's most powerful people, as well as an outright attempt to manipulate the media into believing something was possible that wasn't. And the media bought it, hook, line, and sinker. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been wasted building giant data centers to crunch numbers for software that has no real product-market fit, all while trying to hammer it into various shapes to make it pretend that it's alive, conscious, or even a useful product. There is no path, from what I can see, to turn generative AI and its associated products into anything resembling sustainable businesses, and the only path that big tech appeared to have was to throw as much money, power, and data at the problem as possible, an avenue that appears to be another dead end. And worse still, nothing has really come out of this movement. I've used a handful of AI products that I've found useful — an AI powered journal, for example — but these are not the products that one associates with "revolutions," but useful tools that would have been a welcome surprise if they didn't require burning billions of dollars, blowing past emissions targets and stealing the creative works of millions of people to train them. I truly don't know what happens next, but I'll walk you through what I'm thinking. If we're truly at the diminishing returns stage of transformer-based models, it will be extremely difficult to justify buying further iterations of NVIDIA GPUs past Blackwell. The entire generative AI movement lives and dies by the idea that more compute power and more training data makes these things better, and if that's no longer the case, there's little reason to keep buying bigger and better. After all, what's the point? Even now, what exactly happens when Microsoft or Google has racks-worth of Blackwell GPUs? The models aren't going to get better. This also makes the lives of OpenAI and Anthropic that much more difficult. Sam Altman has grown rich and powerful lying about how GPT will somehow lead to AGI, but at this point, what exactly is OpenAI meant to do? The only way it’s ever been able to develop new models is by throwing masses of compute and training data at the problem, and its only other choice is to start stapling its reasoning model onto its main Large Language Model, at which point something happens, something so good that literally nobody working for OpenAI or in the media appears to be able to tell you what it is. Putting that aside, OpenAI is also a terrible business that has to burn $5 billion to make $3.4 billion, with no proof that it’s capable of bringing down costs. The constant refrain I hear from VCs and AI fantasists is that "chips will bring down the cost of inference," yet I don't see any proof of that happening, nor do I think it'll happen quickly enough for these companies to turn things around. And you can feel the desperation, too. OpenAI is reportedly looking at ads as a means to narrow the gap between its revenues and losses. As I pointed out in Burst Damage, introducing an advertising revenue stream would require significant upfront investment, both in terms of technology and talent. OpenAI would need a way to target ads, and a team to sell advertising — or, instead, use a third-party ad network that would take a significant bite out of its revenue. It’s unclear how much OpenAI could charge advertisers, or what percentage of its reported 200 million weekly users have an ad-blocker installed. Or, for that matter, whether ads would provide a perverse incentive for OpenAI to enshittify an already unreliable product. Facebook and Google — as I’ve previously noted — have made their products manifestly worse in order to increase the amount of time people spend on their sites, and thus, the number of ads they see. In the case of Facebook, it buried your newsfeed under a deluge of AI-generated sludge and “recommended content.” Google, meanwhile, has progressively degraded the quality of its search results in order to increase the volume of queries it received as a means of making sure users saw more ads. OpenAI could, just as easily, fall into the same temptation. Most people who use ChatGPT are trying to accomplish a specific task — like writing a term paper, or researching a topic, or whatever — and then they leave. And so, the amount of ads they’d conceivably see each will undoubtedly be comparatively low compared to a social network or search engine. Would OpenAI try to get users to stick around longer — to write more prompts — by crippling the performance of its models? Even if OpenAI listens to its better angels, the reality still stands: ads won’t dam the rising tide of red ink that promises to eventually drown the company. This is a truly dismal situation where the only options are to stop now, or continue burning money until the heat gets too much. It cost $100 million to train GPT-4o, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei estimated a few months ago that training future models will cost $1 billion to $10 billion, with one researcher claiming that training OpenAI's GPT-5 will cost around $1 billion. And that’s before mentioning any, to quote a Rumsfeldism, “unknown unknowns.” Trump’s election, at the risk of sounding like a cliché, changes everything and in ways we don’t yet fully understand. According to the Wall Street Journal, Musk has successfully ingratiated himself with Trump, thanks to his early and full-throated support of his campaign. He’s now reportedly living in Mar a Lago, sitting on calls with world leaders, and whispering in Trump’s ear as he builds his cabinet. And, as The Journal claims, his enemies fear that he could use his position of influence to harm them or their businesses — chiefly Sam Altman, who is “persona non grata” in Musk’s world, largely due to the new for-profit direction of OpenAI. While it’s likely that these companies will fail due to inevitable organic realities (like running out of money, or not having a product that generates a profit), Musk’s enemies must now contend with a new enemy — one with the full backing of the Federal government, and that neither forgives nor forgets. And, crucially, one that’s not afraid to bend ethical or moral laws to further his own interests — or to inflict pain on those perceived as having slighted him. Even if Musk doesn’t use his newfound political might to hurt Altman and OpenAI, he could still pursue the company as a private citizen. Last Friday, he filed an injunction requesting a halt to OpenAI’s transformation from an ostensible non-profit to a for-profit business. Even if he ultimately fails, should Musk manage to drag the process out, or delay it temporarily, it could strike a terminal blow for OpenAI. That’s because in its most recent fundraise, OpenAI agreed that it would convert its recent $6.6bn equity investment into high-interest debt, should it fail to successfully convert into a for-profit business within a two-year period. This was a tight deadline to begin with, and it can’t afford any delays. The interest payments on that debt would massively increase its cash burn, and it would undoubtedly find it hard to obtain further outside investment.

There are some that will boast about “being right” here, and yes, there is some satisfaction in being so. Nevertheless, knowing that the result of this bubble bursting will be massive layoffs, a dearth in venture capital funding, and a much more fragile tech ecosystem. I’ll end with a quote from Bubble Trouble, a piece I wrote in April: I was right then and I’m right now. Generative AI isn’t a revolution, it’s an evolution of a tech industry overtaken by growth-hungry management consultant types that neither know the problems that real people face nor how to fix them. It’s a sickening waste, a monument to the corrupting force of growth, and a sign that the people in power no longer work for you, the customer, but for the venture capitalists and the markets. I also want to be clear that none of these companies ever had a plan. They believed that if they threw enough GPUs together they would turn generative AI – probabilistic models for generating stuff — into some sort of sentient computer. It’s much easier, and more comfortable, to look at the world as a series of conspiracies and grand strategies, and far scarier to see it for what it is — extremely rich and powerful people that are willing to bet insanely large amounts of money on what amounts to a few PDFs and their gut. This is not big tech’s big plan to excuse building more data centers — it’s the death throes of twenty years of growth-at-all-costs thinking, because throwing a bunch of money at more servers and more engineers always seemed to create more growth. In practice, this means that the people in charge and the strategies they employ are borne not of an interest in improving the lives of their customers, but in increasing revenue growth, which means the products they create aren’t really about solving any problem other than “what will make somebody give me more money,” which doesn’t necessarily mean “provide them with a service.” Generative AI is the perfect monster of the Rot Economy — a technology that lacks any real purpose sold as if it could do literally anything, one without a real business model or killer app, proliferated because big tech no longer innovates, but rather clones and monopolizes. Yes, this much money can be this stupid, and yes, they will burn billions in pursuit of a non-specific dream that involves charging you money and trapping you in their ecosystem. I’m not trying to be a doomsayer, just like I wasn’t trying to be one in March. I believe all of this is going nowhere, and that at some point Google, Microsoft, or Meta is going to blink and pull back on their capital expenditures. And before then, you’re going to get a lot of desperate stories about how “AI gains can be found outside of training new models” to try and keep the party going, despite reality flicking the lights on and off and threatening to call the police. I fear for the future for many reasons, but I always have hope, because I believe that there are still good people in the tech industry and that customers are seeing the light. Bluesky feels different — growing rapidly, competing with both Threads and Twitter, all while selling an honest product and an open protocol. There are other ideas for the future that aren’t borne of the scuzzy mindset of billionaire shitheels like Sundar Pichai and Sam Altman, and they can — and will — grow out of the ruins created by these kleptocrats.

Title: Bitcoin passes $100,000 milestone

Bitcoin rose above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday as the election of Donald Trump as US president has spurred expectations that his administration will create a friendly environment for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up about 45% in the four weeks since Trump’s sweeping election victory on Nov 5, when a number of pro-crypto lawmakers were also elected to Congress. Bitcoin was trading around $102,600 (3.51 million baht) late Thursday morning Thailand time. “We’re witnessing a paradigm shift. After four years of political purgatory, bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream,” said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of the US crypto firm Galaxy Digital. “This momentum is fueled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a clearer regulatory path.” More than 16 years after its creation, bitcoin appears on the cusp of mainstream acceptance, despite naysayers and a history of controversies. “Bitcoin crossing $100,000 is more than just a milestone; it’s a testament to shifting tides in finance, technology, and geopolitics,” said Justin D’Anethan, a Hong Kong-based crypto analyst. “The figure not that long ago dismissed as fantasy, stands as a reality.” For years a sceptic about crypto, Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Crypto investors see an end to increased scrutiny under US Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler, who said last week he would step down in January when Trump takes office. On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Paul Atkins to run the SEC. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to “develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms”, and the Chamber of Digital Commerce. A number of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are jostling for a seat on Trump’s promised crypto advisory council, seeking a say in his planned overhaul of policy, according to digital asset industry executives. Trump’s businesses may also have a stake in the sector. He unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September. Although details about the business have been scarce, investors have taken his personal interest in the sector as a bullish signal. Trump’s social media company is in advanced talks to buy the crypto trading firm Bakkt, the Financial Times reported last week, citing two people with knowledge of the talks. Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates Truth Social, is close to an all-stock acquisition of Bakkt, according to the FT report. Billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s rebound from a slide below $16,000 in late 2022 has been rapid, boosted by the approval of US-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January this year. The SEC had long attempted to block ETFs from investing in bitcoin, citing investor protection concerns, but the products have allowed more investors, including institutional investors, to gain exposure to bitcoin. More than $4 billion has streamed into US-listed bitcoin ETFs since the election. “We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov 5, US investors resumed buying hand-over-fist,” said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund. There was a strong debut for options on a BlackRock ETF in November with call options — bets on the price going up — substantially more popular than puts. McCann calculated the put to call ratio at about 22 to one. Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with shares in the bitcoin miner Mara Holdings up around 65% in November. Yet the rise is not without critics. Two years ago, the industry was wracked by scandal with the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and the jailing of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The cryptocurrency industry also has been criticised for its staggering energy usage, while crypto crime remains a concern, too. Market participants are keeping a close eye on what happens now that bitcoin has broken above $100,000, with investors and speculators possibly looking to pocket some of their recent gains. “But once we flush out those sell orders, this could go higher still, and very rapidly,” said Steven McClurg, the founder of Canary Capital, a digital assets investment firm. He said he expects bitcoin to hit $120,000 by Christmas.

Title: SolarZero collapse: Willis demands more answers from NZGIF, Crown agency says BlackRock caught it on the hop

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Finance Minister Nicola Willis says she still has multiple questions about Crown-backed NZ Green Investment Finance's $145 million credit line for SolarZero installs. Photo / Mark Mitchell A fact-finding day on SolarZero’s collapse has only led to more questions. The Kiwi-founded firm, bought by US private equity giant BlackRock for $110 million in mid-2022, went into liquidation on Tuesday last week, owing more than $40m, including $4.1m to tradies and a similar amount to staff in holiday and notice pay. In August, the NZ Green Investment Fund (NZGIF) set up by the previous Government said it had extended the debt facility it provided to SolarZero to $145m as part of wider credit arrangements involving international lenders that totalled $365m. NZGIF said SolarZero had drawn down $110m by the time of its liquidation. On Thursday morning, NZGIF chairwoman Cecilia Tarrant met with Finance Minister Nicola Willis and Climate Change Minister Simon Watts. Shortly after the meeting, Willis’ office sent a statement saying, “Nicola Willis conveyed her expectation that NZGIF will be publicly accountable for the investment it has made.” She still has questions about: “The failure of SolarZero raised questions about taxpayers’ money being used in this way and those are questions ministers will be giving consideration to,” the statement said. Willis sought assurances about NZGIF’s other investments. These include solar farm start-up Lodestone Energy, to which it provided a $15m working capital facility in FY24. “This facility remains current,” a spokesman told the Herald this afternoon. A full list of its investments has been posted online here. While its various SolarZero debt facilities have been easily the largest bits of business for the self-styled “green bank” (it is not a registered bank), NZGIF has also extended chunky credit lines to EV fleet leasing firm Carbn ($42.4m), UK firm Zenobe ($20m), which is doing work on electrification of businesses in NZ, solar farm firms Far North Solar Farm ($78m) and Lodestone Energy ($15m). And although a lot of NZGIF’s dealings have been with startups, it has also done business with established players including a $1.2m debit facility for Genesis Energy (”to help industry switch from fossil fuels”), a $10m mezzanine debt facility to NZ Post to co-finance $10m spent on electric vans and a $15m “green credit facility” to CentrePort for “accelerating projects to decarbonise Wellington’s port”. As she emerged from her meeting with Willis and Watts, Tarrant initially refused to comment, then said to Newstalk ZB’s Jason Walls: “We do feel very bad, as we all do, about the people who have lost their jobs, but we did not lend to SolarZero the company and we are not responsible for what the company has done.” Tarrant said: “Let’s step back a minute and understand that we did not lend to SolarZero itself. We lent on the receivables; the panels and batteries that were installed on people’s houses and those contracts. Those customers are fine. They are now being serviced by Verofi as the standby servicer who has stepped in to take over from SolarZero.” The NZGIF debt was securitised and held by two special-purpose vehicles, both of which were taken over by the Public Trust shortly before the liquidation. The special purpose vehicles are not in liquidation. The first liquidators report says: “The Liquidators understand that SZL [SolarZero Limited] had underwritten certain aspects of the securitisation, resulting in unsustainable regular payments to the SPVs.” Later on Thursday, Tarrant added in a statement: “Our Shareholding Ministers rightly have questions about how this all happened, and so do we. The change in stance from SolarZero’s owner BlackRock came as a surprise to NZGIF and other lenders, and indeed appears to have caught SolarZero’s CEO off guard given recent public comments. “We are extremely frustrated by this outcome. NZGIF and other international lenders worked to support the growth of this business. BlackRock has not explained its sudden change in stance toward this company, which has severely impacted its staff, suppliers, contractors and partners. “Prior to early November we had no indication from the SolarZero board or BlackRock that the company did not have the support of its owner, which had been funding the ongoing operation of the group. NZGIF takes an active role in monitoring and engaging with investee and client companies and it is fair to say we, along with staff, suppliers and customers, have been shocked by BlackRock’s decision to place the company in liquidation,” Tarrant said. An NZGIF spokesman said earlier that it had less than a day’s notice of BlackRock’s intent to liquidate. The Herald has asked BlackRock for comment. The first liquidators’ report revealed that beyond the $110m it paid for SolarZero, the private equity firm had “injected significant additional capital to the group since its 2022 acquisition, totalling $147.8m”. Liquidators Russell Moore and Stephen Keen, both of Grant Thornton, said the firm had never been profitable. The pair said the total amount owing was still being established. It was not clear at this point if there would be funds to pay secured creditors. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team.

Title: To $100,000 and beyond: Bitcoin's wild ride

(Reuters) -Bitcoin broke above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday as the election of Republican Donald Trump as president fuelled bets that his administration will create a friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. The world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency has more than doubled from this year's low of $38,505 and is up over 50% since Trump's sweeping election win in early November. Here are key events in bitcoin's journey towards $100,000 and beyond: 2008: Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the cryptocurrency's presumed developer, introduces the concept of bitcoin 2010: The first retail transaction takes place when a user pays 10,000 bitcoin for two Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) pizzas 2013: As bitcoin's popularity grows, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of crypto exchange Gemini, file their first application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to create a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale Investments launches the Bitcoin Investment Trust, an open-ended private bitcoin trust. 2016: The Winklevoss brothers adjust their application numerous times, such as the exchange on which the product would be traded. They also file amendments naming State Street (NYSE:STT) as administrator. Grayscale files with the SEC to convert its bitcoin trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. 2017: The SEC rejects the Winklevoss application on the grounds bitcoin markets were not mature enough. Grayscale withdraws its first attempt to convert its trust into an ETF, saying the regulatory environment was not developed enough. 2018: The SEC rejects the Winklevoss twins' second application to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, saying cryptocurrency exchanges do not have the necessary controls to prevent manipulation. 2020: Grayscale transforms its trust into an SEC-reporting entity, and its shares begin trading on the pink sheets, for stocks that trade over the counter. Although not an ETF, it is the first publicly traded bitcoin fund in the U.S. 2021: The first spot bitcoin ETF launches in Canada. Gary Gensler replaces Jay Clayton as SEC chair in April. In October, the SEC approves the ProShares Bitcoin Trust listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, noting the CME has a satisfactory mechanism for surveilling abuse in the futures market. It is the first U.S.-listed futures-based bitcoin ETF, accumulating $1 billion in assets within its first days of trading - faster than any other ETF. Also in October, Grayscale again submits an application to the SEC to convert its trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. 2022: The SEC rejects several applications from would-be spot bitcoin ETF issuers, including SkyBridge, Fidelity and Bitwise. The SEC also rejects Grayscale's application, prompting the company to sue the agency. Amid crashing crypto prices, multiple crypto companies file for bankruptcy, including Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and FTX, whose founder Sam Bankman-Fried is also charged with fraud. 2023: May: Cathie Woods' ARK Investments and CBOE Global Markets file for a spot bitcoin ETF, giving the SEC a maximum of 240 days to approve or reject the application. June: BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) files a spot bitcoin ETF application with the SEC, raising industry hopes the agency may approve the product and sending the price of bitcoin to a one-year high. A flurry of other issuers and exchanges, including Fidelity and Invesco, file bitcoin ETF applications in the subsequent weeks and months. August: A federal appeals court in Washington D.C. rules in favour of Grayscale, saying the SEC did not justify why it had rejected its proposal. Europe's first spot bitcoin ETF begins trading on the Euronext (EPA:ENX) Amsterdam stock exchange. October: The SEC opts not to appeal the court's ruling in the Grayscale case and is required to reexamine the application. 2024: Jan. 10: The SEC approves 11 proposals from issuers including BlackRock, Fidelity and VanEck, among others, to launch spot bitcoin ETFs. February: Net inflows into the 10 largest ETFs hit $4 billion in the first month, according to LSEG data. March: Bitcoin tops $70,000 for the first time to hit a record high, having doubled in value in the five months. June: Trump pitches himself as a champion for cryptocurrency and slammed Democrats' attempts to regulate the sector during a San Francisco fundraiser. July: Trump tells a bitcoin conference that, if elected, he will create a strategic national bitcoin stockpile and will ensure the United States is the "crypto capital of the planet." October: The SEC grants "accelerated approval" to U.S. exchanges to list and trade options tied to 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. Nov 6: Trump is declared winner of the presidential election, sparking a huge rally in a range of assets, with bitcoin being the standout gainer. Nov 12: Total (EPA:TTEF) crypto market cap tops $3 trillion. Year-to-date ETF net inflows hit $25.8 billion, according to LSEG data. Nov 21: Bitcoin nears $100,000 for the first time in history, driven by a swell of buying from investors in anticipation of Trump dismantling a lot of the regulation around crypto investment. Dec. 5: Bitcoin soars past $100,000 for the first time, taking its gains for the year to over 140%.

Latest Topics The Nightly Topics The price of bitcoin soared past the long-awaited $US100,000 benchmark for the first time ever late Wednesday evening. The flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by more than 5 per cent at $101,072.00, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it rose as high as $101,555.40. The move came hours after President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to nominate Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a move viewed by the crypto community as being in keeping with his promise not just to replace Gary Gensler — who has become something of a villain in crypto for the agency’s regulation-by-enforcement approach to the industry under his leadership — but to set up a more supportive regulatory environment for the crypto industry more broadly.

In the same day, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said bitcoin is “just like gold only it’s virtual, it’s digital,” speaking at the DealBook conference. He further clarified that “people are not using it as a form of payment, or as a store of value” and that “it’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold.” It’s a day of celebration for longtime bitcoin investors, who have held on for dear life, or “HODL’d” through several of the cryptocurrency’s boom and bust cycles, during which government and financial institutions remained dismissive — and even hostile — toward the asset class. That’s largely because of the cryptocurrency’s anti-establishment roots. The original idea for Bitcoin was proposed at the height of the 2008 financial crisis: a “peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution,” its founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote in the Bitcoin Whitepaper. In recent years, however, the industry has demonstrated the value of bitcoin to much of the institutional investing world. BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco and others launched the first spot bitcoin ETFs at the beginning of this year — bitcoin’s “IPO” moment — and the growing demand for them by institutions has helped drive the price higher. In November, Rick Wurster, the incoming CEO of Charles Schwab, said the firm is preparing to enter spot crypto trading, pending regulatory changes expected in the next Trump administration. “We’re witnessing a paradigm shift. After four years of political purgatory, bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream,” Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, told CNBC. Bitcoin has been widely expected to reach the landmark $100,000 level since the U.S. presidential election. However, excited investors sent bitcoin closer to this mark much sooner than initially anticipated; it rose as high as $99,849.99 on Nov. 22. There is much hope that President-elect Donald Trump will deliver on several pro-crypto initiatives in the year ahead – including the establishment of a national strategic bitcoin reserve or stockpile, no taxes on crypto transactions and opening up the crypto public equity markets with more IPOs. “Over the long term, I’m bullish,” Novogratz added. “It won’t be a straight line up, and investors should always consider taking gains off the table. But, with a pro-crypto administration about to take charge in the U.S., it’ll be hard for the rest of the world not to take notice.” Copy Link Copied Government accused of inflaming anti-Semitism as Australian Jews become targets of ‘domestic terrorism’.

Title: Bitcoin hits $100k - and seven other wild moments in its history

The price of Bitcoin has for the first time broken past the $100,000 mark, hitting a new record high. The value of the world's biggest cryptocurrency has been boosted by hopes US President-elect Donald Trump will adopt crypto-friendly policies. The milestone was reached hours after Trump said he would nominate former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Paul Atkins to run the Wall Street regulator. Mr Atkins is seen as being far more pro-cryptocurrency than the current head of the SEC, Gary Gensler. The $100,000 milestone prompted celebrations from cryptocurrency fans around the world. Bitcoin's wildly fluctuating value has always attracted interest, with its backers reacting with delight when it has passed previous price thresholds - and defiance during its slumps. But this particular landmark has been especially keenly anticipated. For weeks charts, memes and predictions have swirled around social media about when the price would hit the figure thought to be one of the holy grails of the crypto world. Millions of viewers even tuned in to online watch parties as the price hovered close to $100k. The value of a single bitcoin is one of the barometers of optimism in the cryptocurrency industry which is now estimated to be worth $3.3tn, according to analysis firm Coin Market Cap. Trump's election victory last month was the catalyst for the latest surge. The president-elect has vowed to make the US "the crypto capital of the planet" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a "scam." Also remarkable is just how Bitcoin's price has rocketed. A valuation of $100k represents a 40% increase on election day in the U.S. and more than double the price it started the year at. But there's lots more to Bitcoin than the dizzying changes in its value. From its enigmatic inventor to the bringing down of the so-called Crypto King, it's a story with many twists and turns, which has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes. So here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history. Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto. They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email. Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers. But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out. In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be a false lead caused by some mistranslated information. Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi. Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him. Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza. On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas. A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day. A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online. Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin. The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars! In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender. Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country. While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped. He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country. As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years. The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country. It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value. A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value. In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions. These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part. Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves. At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment. But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts. Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth. Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact. Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (£78m) - and then accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details. That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline. Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him. He told the BBC: "It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling." No-one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community. FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days. Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research. Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: "I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was." After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years. Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies. In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any. Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs. It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined. Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold. Ann Jensen, from Salisbury, was tricked into investing by a deepfake of Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Justin Sun described Maurizio Cattelan's infamous 2019 work as "much better than other bananas". New evidence suggests the YouTuber promoted investments without revealing his financial interest in them. James Howells accidentally threw out his hard drive in 2013 and has been searching for it ever since. Ilya Lichtenstein laundered the stolen cryptocurrency with his wife Heather Morgan aka Razzlekhan. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

By Thursday afternoon, the flagship cryptocurrency pulled back from the milestone. It was recently higher by 0.28% at $99,140.00, according to Coin Metrics, trading at the lows of Thursday's trading following some profit taking by investors. On Wednesday night, it rose as high as $103,844.05. The move came after President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to nominate Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The appointment could fulfill Trump's most important campaign promise to the crypto industry: to replace Gary Gensler, who has become something of a villain in crypto for the agency's regulation-by-enforcement approach to the industry under his leadership. Trump congratulated bitcoiners in a Truth Social post Thursday morning, saying "you're welcome" for his part in helping send bitcoin to $100,000 and that "together, we will make America great again." It's a day of celebration for longtime bitcoin investors, who have held on for dear life, or "HODL'd" through several of the cryptocurrency's boom-and-bust cycles, during which government and financial institutions remained dismissive — and even hostile — toward the asset class. That's largely because of the cryptocurrency's anti-establishment roots.

Title: Bitcoin Hits Major Milestone of $100K, Nears $2 Trillion Market Value

Bitcoin's price has surged past the $100,000 mark for the first time in its history, fueled by institutional demand, corporate accumulation and heightened expectations of crypto-friendly policies under Donald Trump's presidency. Now ahead about 130% year-to-date, bitcoin's market capitalization has risen to just shy of $2 trillion only 15 years after coming into existence. For reference, Nvidia and Apple sport market caps of about $3.5 trillion, Microsoft $3 trillion, and Google and Amazon $2.2 trillion. The market capitalization of all the gold in the world is roughly $17.7 trillion. At the forefront of this rally was the early-2024 launch of spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) by asset management giants including BlackRock and Fidelity. These products have been a resounding success, securing assets under management of around $30 billion in less than one year's time. Despite the success of the ETFs, the move higher in bitcoin seemingly stalled throughout a large chunk of this year, at least in part thanks to regulatory uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election. The early November victory of crypto-friendly Donald Trump, though, spurred new legs for the rally, with bitcoin quickly taking out its March high above $73,500, then in fast time moving past $80,000, then $90,000, and finally $100,000 just minutes ago. Read more: Crypto Foe and SEC Chair Gary Gensler Will Quit When Trump Takes Office Another large part of the bull story is growing corporate adoption, led by MicroStrategy (MSTR) and its Executive Chairman Michael Saylor. The company — which began its bitcoin purchases in August 2020 — has continued to raise billions of dollars to deploy into bitcoin, taking its holdings to 386,700 tokens which are now worth more than $38 billion. Saylor and team have inspired other publicly traded companies, U.S.-listed Semler Scientific and Japan-listed Metaplanet among them, to pursue similar strategies. Even tech giant Microsoft has a proposal before its board as to whether it should pursue a bitcoin treasury strategy.

Title: Bitcoin tops $100,000 on optimism over Trump crypto plans

(Reuters) -Bitcoin catapulted above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, a milestone hailed even by sceptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a friendly U.S. administration to cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets. Once it broke $100,000 in Thursday's Asian morning, boosted by U.S. President-elect Trump's nomination of pro-crypto Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was soon at an all-time high of $103,649. It last fetched $98,803, up 0.95% on the day. The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost doubled over the year so far to hit a record over $3.8 trillion, according to data provider CoinGecko. By comparison, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) alone is worth about $3.7 trillion. Bitcoin's march from the libertarian fringe to Wall Street has minted millionaires, a new asset class and popularised the concept of "decentralised finance" in a volatile and often controversial period since its creation 16 years ago. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up more than 50% in the four weeks since Donald Trump's sweeping election victory, which also saw a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to Congress. "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!" Trump said on Truth Social, his social media network, on Thursday. "We're witnessing a paradigm shift," said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of U.S. crypto firm Galaxy Digital (TSX:GLXY). "Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream - this momentum is fuelled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a clearer regulatory path." Trump - who once labelled crypto a scam - embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. "We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov. 5, U.S. investors resumed buying hand-over-fist," said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund. Bitcoin's proponents cheered Trump's nomination of Atkins to the SEC. A former SEC commissioner, Atkins has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to "develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms," and the Chamber of Digital Commerce. "Atkins will offer a new perspective, anchored by a deep understanding of the digital asset ecosystem," said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith. "We look forward to working with him ... and ushering in – together – a new wave of American crypto innovation." A slew of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are also jostling for a seat on Trump's promised crypto advisory council. PART OF THE LANDSCAPE Bitcoin has proven a survivor through precipitous downturns. Its move into six-figure territory is a remarkable comeback from a dip below $16,000 in 2022 when the industry was reeling from the collapse of the FTX exchange. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was subsequently jailed. Analysts say the growing embrace of bitcoin by big investors this year has been a driving force behind the record-breaking rally. U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds were approved in January and have been a conduit for large-scale buying, with more than $4 billion streaming into these funds since the election. "Roughly 3% of the total supply of bitcoins that will ever exist have been purchased in 2024 by institutional money," said Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF). "Digital assets, as an asset class, is becoming normalised," he said. It is already becoming increasingly financialised, with the launch of bitcoin futures in 2017 and a strong debut for options on BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s ETF in November. Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings and exchange operator Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) each up around 65% in November. Software (ETR:SOWGn) firm Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), which has repeatedly raised funds to buy bitcoin and held an aggregate of about 402,100 bitcoins as of Dec. 1, has gained around 540% this year. Trump himself unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September, although details have been scarce and billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. Some say the asset remains a speculative or investment vehicle and not an instrument for payments. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell likened bitcoin to gold, “only it's virtual, it's digital." "People are not using it as a form of payment, or as a store of value. It's highly volatile, it’s not a competitor for the dollar." While earlier big bitcoin rallies have been followed by significant pullbacks, its wider adoption now may help tamp down volatility, analysts said. "That is not to say that there will not be 30-50% drawdowns over time, but my base case is that the nature of the drawdowns will be less severe than what we saw in the last bear market," Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said. "Passive flows into ETFs, a liquid options market, corporate treasury adoption, and nation state adoption will likely play a large role in dampening volatility," Farrell said. 'WHO CAN PROHIBIT IT' Cryptocurrencies have been criticised for their massive energy consumption and use in crime around the world, and the underlying technology is far from delivering a revolution in the way money moves around the globe. The U.S. and Britain announced on Wednesday they had disrupted what they described as a global money laundering ring which used cryptocurrency to help rich Russians to evade sanctions and launder cash for drug traffickers. Although calculations vary, the Cambridge University Centre for Alternative Finance estimates bitcoin uses around the same amount of electricity each year as Poland or South Africa. Still, as Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out at an investment conference on Wednesday: "Who can prohibit it? No one." And its longevity is perhaps testament to a degree of resilience. "As time goes by it's proving itself as part of the financial landscape," said Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) in Sydney. "I find it very hard to value it ... it's anyone's guess. But it does have a momentum aspect to it and at the moment the momentum is up."

Title: Marc Benioff says humans are already working alongside AI agents

The future is here and it's humans working alongside robots, according to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. Salesforce reported its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, beating revenue expectations and sending the stock price up around 10% as of market close on Wednesday. During the earnings call, Benioff made it clear he's all in on Agentforce, the company's service that clients can use to build AI-powered agents. AI agents, which can operate computers and complete tasks that might otherwise require human hands, have been touted by some as the next big thing in generative AI. Benioff seems to agree. Agentforce became generally available in late October and allows companies to create their own custom AI agents. Benioff said the company delivered 200 deals in that first week and that he expects demand for AI agents to increase, calling Salesforce the "largest supplier of digital labor." Benioff said some Salesforce clients already building out their digital labor force include FedEx, Adecco, Accenture, Ace Hardware, IBM, and RBC Wealth Managements. Benioff said that in addition to humans working alongside AI agents, they'll soon be working alongside robots as well. "On top of this agentic layer, we'll soon see a robotic layer as well where these agents will manifest into robots," he said, adding, "These agents are not tools. They are becoming collaborators." Benioff has previously said he thought the "upper limits" of large language models, which power chatbots like ChatGPT, had been reached and that the future was AI agents. Salesforce isn't the only tech company focusing on agents. Microsoft helps customers create agents through its AI studio, Copilot. Meta is working on agents, Google its making AI agents with Gemini, and Bloomberg recently reported OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, plans to launch AI agents next year. Benioff also said on the earnings call that the rise in digital labor means "productivity is no longer tied to workforce growth, but to this intelligent technology that can be scaled without limits." "This isn't just some far off future," he added, "It's happening right now." Jump to

Title: Bitcoin Whale Resurfaces After 11 Years After Its BTC’s Value Rose Over 15,000%
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/12/bitcoin-whale-resurfaces-after-11-years-after-its-btcs-value-rose-over-15000/
Time Published: 2024-12-04T23:50:00Z
Full Content:
A Bitcoin whale that had been inactive for 11 years has resurfaced with a transaction of around $257 million in BTC after seeing the price of their holdings surge by over 15,300% since their last action. According to data shared by on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the long-dormant Bitcoin whale received 2,700 BTC back in December 2013 when the price of the cryptocurrency was at $625.84. Since then, BTC’s price rose more than 15,300% to now stand at $96,320. Bitcoin whale movements are notable as they can influence the price of the flagship cryptocurrency, with whales from around the era of BTC creator Satoshi Nakamoto, who disappeared back in 2010, being especially influential and closely watched. The whale resurfaced at a time in which the total amount of Bitcoin exchange reserves has dropped to its lowest level in years after massive outflows have been seen since the US presidential election in early November led to a massive cryptocurrency market rally. According to data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, over 171,000 BTC have moved off of cryptocurrency trading platforms since Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won the election, leading to a market rally given his pro-crypto stance during the campaign. As CryptoGlobe reported, Bitcoin whales have been steadily accumulating over the last few weeks as BTC trades below the psychological resistance level around $100,000. CryptoQuant data shows that 16,000 BTC worth nearly $1.5 billion entered whale reserves in a single day late last month. A lower amount of Bitcoin on exchanges suggests that there is less supply available on the market, which if coupled with steady or rising demand could lead to a cryptocurrency price rise. The price of Bitcoin has been strolling to surpass the $100,000 psychological barrier after surging exponentially after Trump secured the US elections. The cryptocurrency is, at the time of writing, trading at $96.700 after moving up more than 40% in the last month. While whales are accumulating, the total holdings of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) offered by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, have grown to surpass the 500,000 BTC mark. Another entity heavily accumulating the flagship cryptocurrency is Nasdaq-listed business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which accumulated an additional 15,400 coins for $1.5 billion earlier this month to bring its total BTC holdings above the 400,000 threshold.

Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently upgraded Axon's stock from Equalweight to Overweight, reflecting growing confidence in the company's sustainability, which has been reported between 25-30%. The firm's bullish stance is partly due to robust police technology budgets and the potential for rapid adoption of Axon's artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Simultaneously, Axon reported a strong third-quarter performance, with record bookings and a 32% year-over-year growth in revenue. The company raised its Q4 revenue guidance to between $560-570 million and expects full-year revenue to exceed $2.07 billion. This performance was spurred by the integration of recently acquired Dedrone and the launch of new AI-driven products. However, shares of Axon, along with other defense contractors, saw a decline in response to potential ceasefire reports between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Nevertheless, analysts from Morgan Stanley recommend purchasing Axon's stock on any weakness, indicating a strong conviction in the company's market position and future performance.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In this article, we’ll be summarizing a bullish thesis posted on VIC covering Aspen Aerogels, Inc. (NYSE:ASPN) in October, when the stock was trading at $21.86. Currently, ASPN stock is trading at $14.83, which shows that the stock has dipped since the publication of this thesis. Nonetheless, ASPN stock is now trading at a forward PE ratio (non-GAAP) of 38.44, and the stock is trading at 2.70 times, forward sales estimates. A technician meticulously inspecting a corrosion-resistant insulation panel for a fire-protection system. As a leading proponent of aerogel technology, Aspen Aerogels, Inc. (ASPN) offers cutting-edge thermal management solutions for sectors including sustainable building insulation, energy infrastructure, electric vehicles (EVs), and industry. Its PyroThin® insulation tackles critical EV problems including thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries, placing Aspen as a major player in an industry expected to reach over 100 million vehicles by 2030. In order to improve energy efficiency and sustainability, the company's aerogels are also extensively applied in projects related to energy infrastructure like petrochemical plants and LNG facilities. Growing environmental and legislative concerns have helped Aspen since its products fulfill strict energy efficiency criteria and ESG targets. The company obtained a $150 million DOE loan in 2023 to grow its Georgia plant, raising PyroThin® manufacturing capacity. This development helps it to satisfy growing demand both domestically and abroad, especially as EV safety rules tighten worldwide. Aspen's long-term income from that relationship may be lowered by GM's move toward prismatic battery cells, but diversification among other OEMs and industrial uses as well as Aspen's larger prospects in cylindrical and pouch cell markets should help to offset this impact. Driven by increasing demand in the EV industry and industrial uses, Aspen's growth path has been distinguished by constant upward changes in revenue projection. Its capacity to boost guidance several times in 2024 highlights the confidence of management and the resilience of its plan. Aspen's strategic efforts in growing production and enhancing operational efficiency, together with its central role in energy-efficient markets, help it to be positioned for continuous growth despite hazards like pricing constraints and EV market dependency. The company's competitive edge in highly sought-after markets is cemented by its alignment with federal sustainability projects and developing industry trends. Aspen Aerogels, Inc. (ASPN) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Title: Stocks Buoyed by Tech Rally With Powell in Focus: Markets Wrap

(Bloomberg) -- A rally in the world’s largest technology companies drove stocks higher, with traders wading through the latest economic data and awaiting Jerome Powell’s remarks for clues on the Federal Reserve’s next steps. Treasuries rose and the dollar fluctuated. Equities headed toward all-time highs, with the S&P 500 set for its 56th closing record in 2024. The Nasdaq 100 climbed about 1%. Nvidia Corp. led a gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps higher as the group extended this year’s surge to 62%. Salesforce Inc. jumped 9% and Marvell Technology Inc. soared 24% as their results boosted hopes both companies will keep benefiting from an industrywide boom in artificial intelligence. Just days ahead of the key jobs report, data showed employment at US companies remained firm in November while services activity expanded at the slowest pace in three months. Powell participates in a moderated discussion later Wednesday, and one of his favorite barometers of the economy — the Beige Book — will likely reflect the post-election surge in sentiment. “Right now, the odds favor another cut this month followed by a pause in January, but a significant change in the jobs landscape could rearrange those puzzle pieces,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%. The Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. European stocks advanced for a fifth consecutive session as German shares hit a fresh record. Investors were watching the no-confidence vote taking place in France. Treasury 10-year yields declined four basis points to 4.18%. The market-implied odds of a quarter-point Fed cut this month have improved to around 70%. Additionally, a cumulative 80 basis points of easing is priced in by the end of next year. To George Smith at LPL Financial, momentum could continue for stocks as December has been a good month for market seasonals. It’s overall the second-best performing month since 1950 — with a 1.6% average gain — and the third-strongest over the past five years, according to Smith. When studying the proportion of positive monthly returns since 1950, December often delivers the highest proportion of positive monthly returns — around 74%. Despite the seasonality, Smith doesn’t out the possibility of short-term weakness, especially as geopolitical threats have the potential to escalate. Equities may also need to readjust to what may be a slower and shallower Fed rate-cutting cycle than markets are currently pricing in, he noted. “We remain tactically bullish into year-end given the positive macro environment, earnings growth, and a Fed that remains supportive of markets,” wrote JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Market Intelligence Team led by Andrew Tyler. “It is sensible to play the market’s momentum and see low pullback potential until mid-January,” they say. To some technical analysts who watch and analyze price moves, and strategists that keep an eye on investor sentiment, the initial rumblings are starting to sound a lot like a stock market that has overheated. A Bank of America Corp. indicator that tracks sell-side strategists’ average recommendations remains at its highest level since early 2022, in neutral territory, but much closer to a contrarian “sell” signal than a “buy.” “Statistically (and paradoxically), the impact of 2024’s big gains has made the market look riskier for long-term investors, but potentially safer for near-term speculators,” the Leuthold Group’s Doug Ramsey wrote this week. Leuthold’s major trend index (MTI) — which takes into account many different kinds of indicators — remains at a “high neutral,” but all of the indexes in the MTI closed last week with maximum-bullish readings. All the short-term positioning, rally chasing and mechanical buying flow speaks to an attitude of just running with the market tide. That doesn’t stop the potential for things to change when the calendar flips into 2025. “To put it simply, and probably no one wants to hear it, but this is not a good set up — investors and speculators alike have been lulled into permabull paradise,” writes Callum Thomas at Topdown Charts. Investors have their hopes up for a Santa Claus rally, but a healthy dose of skepticism might be warranted after November’s stellar run-up, according to Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “The bar for success is now a lot higher for an economy that may still be in flux,” Cox said. “Yields show that expectations have moved a lot over the past two months, yet we haven’t seen any sustained, clear momentum in economic data. Expectations matter, and the job market is under a microscope.” To Mark Hackett at Nationwide, the sustainability of the market rally will be dependent on the continued resilience of the consumer. One of the best forecasters of consumer spending is the health of the job market. “Markets continue to be driven by a combination of technical and fundamental factors,” Hackett noted. “The consistency of the rally is demoralizing to bears, creating a ‘virtuous circle’ where buying drives further buying. There are questions of sustainability into 2025 given elevated expectations and valuations, but that is unlikely to derail the near-term momentum.” Appetite for equities has shown no sign of abating this year. The S&P 500 made multiple record highs, surging over 25%, powered by technology shares and a broad preference for US assets. The rally extended after the election of Donald Trump raised hopes of tax cuts and deregulation. While American equities have persistently outpaced their global peers, BlackRock Investment Institute says that could continue. The US benefits more from “mega forces,” driving corporate earnings, the firm notes. That is supported by a favorable growth outlook plus potential tax cuts and regulatory easing. “Some valuation measures – whether price-to-earnings ratios or equity risk premiums – look rich relative to history. But they may not tell the full story,” according to BII. “Comparing today’s index to that of the past is like comparing apples to oranges. Plus, valuations tend to matter more for returns over a long-term horizon than in the near term.” BII says the AI mega force will likely benefit US stocks more and that’s why the firm stays overweight, particularly relative to global peers such as European stocks. “The upshot: We are risk-on for now, but stay nimble. Key signposts for changing our view include any surge in long-term bond yields or an escalation in trade protectionism,” BII concluded.

Full Content:
Joshua Isner, President of Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON), recently sold a significant amount of the company's stock, according to a recent SEC filing. The transactions took place on December 3 and December 4, 2024. The sales come as Axon's stock has delivered remarkable returns, with InvestingPro data showing a 183% gain over the past year and the stock trading near its 52-week high. On December 3, Isner sold shares totaling approximately $1.46 million, with prices ranging from $638.00 to $652.79 per share. These sales were part of a pre-arranged trading plan established on September 15, 2023, as noted in the filing. Additionally, on December 4, Isner sold shares valued at $557,687, at a price of $667.09 per share. These sales follow prior transactions on December 2, where Isner disposed of shares to cover tax liabilities related to the vesting of restricted stock units, amounting to approximately $1.5 million, with prices between $636.39 and $646.96 per share. The transactions reflect Isner's continued management of his holdings in Axon Enterprise, a company known for its development of public safety technologies. In other recent news, Axon Enterprise Inc. reported a robust third-quarter performance, with record bookings and a 32% year-over-year growth in revenue. The company's focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and TASER products has played a significant role in this success. Axon raised its Q4 revenue guidance to between $560-570 million and expects full-year revenue to exceed $2.07 billion. This robust performance comes on the heels of the integration of recently acquired Dedrone and the launch of new AI-driven products. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) upgraded the stock from Equalweight to Overweight, reflecting a growing confidence in Axon's growth rate. The upgrade was partly due to recent insights from the International Association of Chiefs of Police event, which underscored the robustness of police tech budgets and Axon's competitive edge in AI solutions. Shares of defense contractors, including Axon, experienced a decline in response to potential ceasefire reports between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah. These developments are recent, reflecting the dynamic nature of the market. It's important to note that while analysts' predictions can provide insight, they do not guarantee future performance.

US stocks ended higher on Wednesday, jumping to fresh highs as traders took in Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's optimistic comments on the US economy. The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed at records, with the Dow topping 45,000 for the first time ever. All eyes were on Powell in the afternoon, when the central bank chief spoke on the strength of the economy at The New York Times' DealBook Summit. "Growth is definitely stronger than we thought, and inflation is coming a little higher," Powell said at the event. "The good news is that we can afford to be a little more cautious as we try to find neutral," he added, referring to the neutral interest rate, a hypothetical level where rates neither expand nor contract the economy. Traders also took in weaker-than-expected private jobs data. Private payrolls rose just 146,000 in the last month, lower than the expected 163,000, according to ADP. Bets that the Fed will cut rates another 25 basis points at their December policy meeting also surged, with investors now pricing in a 78% chance the central bank will issue another quarter-point cut. Odds for a further 25 basis point cut in January held steady at 18%.

Title: Why Walmart Inc. (WMT) Is the Best Retail Stock to Invest in

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Retail Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stands against the other best retail stocks to invest in. On December 2, Lindsey Bell, Chief Strategist at 248 Ventures, appeared on CNBC to discuss the consumer and economy in the holiday shopping season and the impact of proposed tariffs and the strong dollar on earnings. She said that the economy will see a resilient consumer, economy, and marketplace this week and at the end of the year. Bell expressed optimism going into the end of the year and was of the view that there is opportunity in retail at the present after staying in the shadows as a forgotten area. As consumers have shifted in how they spend money and what they spend it on over the last several years, the retail sector is starting to see a comeback to discretionary items. Although an opportunity exists, retailers can only avail of it if they have the right merchandise at the right price or offer the right experience for the consumer. This is because the consumer is still value-oriented and price-sensitive simultaneously. Concerns are circulating in the retail industry about the potential effects of "tariff threats" on the economy. Bell was of the view that it is undoubtedly necessary to stay on top of the potential threats that the president-elect's proposed tariffs might cause to the markets. However, she took us back to Trump's first term as a president and the tariff increases he made, that Joe Biden continued in his term, highlighting that there wasn't a significant lasting inflationary impact to them. She explained how tariffs work, saying that they go up when put on and have an impact in the near term, but eventually subside over time. The markets saw that in 2018 and 2019, while real inflation came in 2021 and 2022 with the pandemic. She reiterated that although the tariffs are something we need to keep an eye on, the scenario is not something we need to worry about from a consumer perspective this holiday shopping season. Although the tariffs may not pose threats to consumers, what do they mean for investors? With the dollar up by half a percent at the time of the interview, concerns are rising about the dollar's possible strength going into the next earnings season and the possible impact on rates that these "tariff threats" might bring about. Bell agreed that the dollar's strength impacts the earnings season, as about 50% of the S&P 500 gets its revenues from overseas multinational companies. She said that the dollar's strength can continue into the year ahead, but this is a relative game. It is important to consider the currency and the strength of the economy around the world, as a strong dollar does depict a strong economy here in the US.

For this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify around 40 retail stocks and narrowed our list to 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund holders, as of fiscal Q3 2024. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey's database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88 Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an omnichannel retailer that operates retail and wholesale stores and clubs, e-commerce websites, and mobile applications. It offers an elaborate array of items, ranging from general merchandise and electronics to food, groceries, and more. The company's fiscal Q3 2025 earnings showed sales growing by 6.1% in constant currency and profit growing by 9.8%. E-commerce was one of the primary drivers of growth worldwide, up 27%. Other growth drivers included advertising and membership income, which grew by 28% and 22%, respectively. These trends allowed the company to grow profits faster than sales while simultaneously working to lower prices and invest in its associates. The rapid growth from these newer businesses is allowing Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to strengthen its business model. It is continuing to gain market share in the US in both general merchandise and grocery. Further trends in the US in fiscal Q3 2024 saw growing in-store volumes, faster curbside pickup, and an increase in delivery sales. There was no like-for-like inflation in the US in fiscal Q3 2025. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is becoming more convenient for its customers and members, and that is helping it drive growth. Overall, WMT ranks 1st on our list of best retail stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of retail stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than WMT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Walmart acquires VIZIO, highlighting its commitment to evolving its digital ecosystem and diversifying revenue streams. Senior merchant jobs can lead to bigger things at Walmart. The former Red Bull executive is faced with turning around investor perceptions amid pressure on shares. Shares of connected TV platform company Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) jumped Wednesday morning after Needham analyst Laura Martin said she believes that Roku will be acquired at a hefty premium in 2025. As of 11:30 a.m. ET, Roku stock was up by 10.5%. Likely in response, Walmart decided to acquire Roku rival Vizio, a deal that closed Tuesday. The bull market looks to be in full force as valuations continue to rise higher for many stocks. Three of these hot stocks that investors should be extra careful about these days are MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR), and CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). Although they have generated some fantastic returns for investors, you may want to consider taking a second look at these stocks before deciding to invest in them, as their valuations are at absurdly high levels. US president Joe Biden made a mistake in not embracing Elon Musk, his predecessor Bill Clinton has said, after the Tesla boss donated millions to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Elon Musk is on another level this year. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO added $119 billion to his fortune in 2024. This pushed his net worth to $348 billion. That's not just a number. It's more than the entire net worth of tech icon Michael Dell. Let that sink in. Musk isn't alone in raking it in, though.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq, Dow, S&P 500 hit records as tech surges, Fed's Powell says economy in 'remarkably good shape'

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A tech rally boosted US stocks on Wednesday, with all three major indexes hitting new record closes, as investors digested Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments that US economy is in "remarkably good shape." The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed about 0.7%, or over 300 points, to close above 45,000 for the first time ever. Meanwhile the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added roughly 0.6% for a fresh closing high of 6,086.49. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 1.3%, clinching a record of its own at 19,735.12. Cloud and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) hit intraday all-time highs on Wednesday, as did iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). AI chip darling Nvidia (NVDA) gained over 3%, nearing its own record. Salesforce (CRM) stock surged 11% after the software maker's quarterly revenue beat boosted hopes for its artificial intelligence products. Markets kept moving higher as Powell spoke at the New York Times DealBook Summit and did little to shake investor confidence that the Fed will cut interest rates at its December meeting. Powell touted a US economy in "remarkably good shape" as a reason he feels the Fed can be "afford to be a little more cautious" in its interest rate cutting path. The central bank is widely expected to lower rates at its Dec. 18 meeting. Traders see near 77% odds of a 25 basis point cut, compared with around 67% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. On that economic strength: A reading on private payrolls suggested the labor market is softening — but not too much. The report is one of several key economic releases this week, leading into the all-important monthly jobs report on Friday. In corporate news, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) halted its investor day after the CEO of insurance unit UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, was fatally shot in Manhattan on Wednesday morning. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy All three major indexes clinched fresh record highs on Wednesday while bitcoin (BTC-USD) headed for a milestone of its own. The world's largest cryptocurrency quickly gained steam in the afternoon, nearly touching $100,000 per coin for the first time ever, as investors digested President-elect Donald Trump's nomination for chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitcoin's prior all-time high is $99,655.50 per coin. Trump officially announced the nomination of Paul Atkins, who is seen as a pro-cryptocurrency official. The former SEC chair under the George W. Bush administration currently serves on the advisory board for digital securities issuance platform Securitize. The labor market has showed signs of further cooling in the second half of 2024. But there have still be an occasional signs of labor market tightness within data, as seen in a Wednesday release from ADP. New data from ADP released Wednesday showed that the median year-over-year pay increase for job switchers rose to 7.2% in November, up from 6.7% in October. Meanwhile, the year-over-year pay increase for job stayers rose to 4.8% from 4.7% the month prior, marking the first monthly increase in wage growth for job stayers in 25 months. "Job changers are the most sensitive to real time labor market conditions," ADP chief economist Nela Richardson told Yahoo Finance. "So if they're getting paid a little bit more in November than they did in October, that tells you that there's a labor market out there that's still a little tight. And that is meaningful to the fed." Specifically, Richardson added, it could be a challenge for a Fed that's already been digesting inflation prints that have shown little progress in recent months. "As long as you have sticky inflation and strong wage growth, you can't be on a preset course to cutting rates, because that could come and bite you later," Richardson said. "So I think they're still going to be very cautious, very data dependent." A rally in megacap tech helped lift US equities on Wednesday. Nvidia (NVDA) rallied more than 3% while Amazon (AMZN) popped more than 2%. All of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) this week, with each stock rising more than 2% in the past three trading days compared to the benchmark index's less than 1% gain. We recently highlighted that these stocks have also been seeing stronger earnings revisions over the past month compared to the S&P 500, perhaps one of the driver's behind the recent market action. "US Big Tech names have solid earnings estimate momentum, and they are much better off than the S&P as a whole as well as its top 10 non-Tech holdings," DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe wrote in a recent note. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that recent economic data could lead to a "cautious" interest rate-cutting cycle. In an interview at the New York Times DealBook Summit, Powell said the US economy is in "remarkably good shape." Given that, and how recent data has calmed concerns over how rapidly the US labor market is weakening, Powell believes the Fed won't need to rapidly cut interest rates while the central bank waits for inflation to fall to its 2% goal. "We can afford to be a little more cautious as we try to find neutral," Powell said. Over the past few years, a stronger-than-expected US economy has continuously surprised Wall Street and its projections. While we've become somewhat used to them now, the recent underestimations are a reversal of what was seen prior to the pandemic when US economic forecasts were often too lofty, RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina told Yahoo Finance. And now, heading into 2025, strategists like Calvasina are leaning into the post-pandemic trend and betting consensus economic forecasts will once again be surprised to the upside by the US economy. "Given that history recently of underestimating [US economic growth] and the fact that GDP forecasts for next year are creeping up very, very, very slowly, I'm making a bet on the 2% to 3% [growth] instead of the 1% to 2%," said Calvasina, who sees the S&P 500 ending next year at 6,600. On Tuesday, Wells Fargo's Christopher Harvey issued the most bullish target on Wall Street at 7,007 while highlighting a "cyclical opportunity catalyzed by upward GDP revisions." If 2024's market driving abbreviation was AI, 2025's is set to be GDP. Read more here. President-elect Donald Trump officially announced the nomination of Paul Atkins as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. Atkins, currently the CEO at Patomak Global Partners, served as SEC chair under the George W. Bush administration from 2002 to 2008. Unlike his potential predecessor Gary Gensler, who is set to leave office in January 2025, Atkins is seen as a pro-cryptocurrency official and currently serves on the advisory board for digital securities issuance platform Securitize. "He's certainly a person that is known for streamlining regulation and being very pro-digital assets, and very knowledgeable in the industry," Carlos Domingo, the founder and CEO of Securitize, told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) moved slightly higher on the news and was trading just north of $96,000 per coin in afternoon trade. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) touched intraday record highs on Wednesday as markets edged higher, buoyed by tech stocks. The S&P 500 Tech sector (XLK) outperformed, jumping about 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also climbed after a strong quarterly report from software maker Salesforce (CRM). UnitedHealth Group (UNH) released a statement Wednesday following the fatal shooting in Manhattan of Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. “We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson," read the company statement. "Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him. We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian’s family and all who were close to him.” Thompson was shot outside the Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan, where the company was holding its investor day. UnitedHealth halted the event this morning following the shooting. President-elect Donald Trump has asked Peter Navarro to be senior counselor for Trade and Manufacturing. Navarro served under Trump's first term as White House trade adviser. "I am pleased to announce that Peter Navarro, a man who was treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else you would like to call it, will serve as my Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing," wrote Trump on social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday. "During my First Term, few were more effective or tenacious than Peter in enforcing my two sacred rules, Buy American, Hire American," wrote Trump. Amazon (AMZN) hit an all-time high on Wednesday amid the company’s AWS re:Invent 2024 cloud conference. Shares of the e-commerce and cloud giant rose more than 2% in early trading. On Wednesday, numerous Wall Street analysts reaffirmed their bullish Buy ratings on the stock, citing the company's artificial intelligence capabilities. The stock has 77 Buy ratings, 5 Holds, and zero Sells. Amazon shares are up 43% year to date. Foot Locker (FL) shares tumbled 12% in early trading after the footwear retailer cut its full-year guidance while missing third quarter estimates, citing weak consumer demand. "Consumer spending trends softened following the peak Back-to-School period in August, and the promotional environment was more elevated than anticipated," the company said in its quarterly release. The stock is down more than 30% year to date. US stocks edged higher on Wednesday, as tech rose, led by shares of Salesforce (CRM). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed 0.4%, or around 200 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.3% on the heels of an all-time closing high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.7%. Salesforce (CRM) stock climbed around 8% in early trading after the software maker's quarterly revenue beat boosted hopes for its AI products. Investors await Fed Chair Jerome Powell's appearance in New York on Wednesday afternoon. Investors will be looking for clues from his commentary about the direction of Fed policymakers' next interest rate move. The last Fed rate policy meeting of the year is slated for Dec. 18.

Title: Why Vertiv Holdings (VRT) Will Be a Major Beneficiary of AI

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Stocks That Will Benefit From AI. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) stands against other stocks that will benefit from AI. Artificial intelligence has been the driving theme of the stock market over the past couple of years which have seen investors battle inflation and high interest rates. Ever since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT in November 2022 and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted the next year that there was a trillion-dollar market in play when it came to upgrading traditional computing hardware to accelerated computing, the stock market has seen no respite. However, when it comes to AI stocks, not all of them have flourished. Apart from Huang's firm, the world's leading graphics processing unit (GPU) designer, shares of OpenAI's biggest backer, i.e., the firm known for the Windows operating system, were two of the biggest initial AI beneficiaries. Between December 2022 and H1 2024, their shares have gained 631% and 75%, respectively. Other technology stocks have also ridden the AI wave and have posted gains ranging between 42% to 308%. Within these, the stock that has gained 308% is Facebook's parent entity and its focus on GPU investments and success with the Llama open source model have caught investor attention. These firms have primarily posted gains because the AI wave, as analysts would like to remind you, is in its early stages. This stage is characterized by investor interest in firms that are AI enablers. However, the next stage of AI investment could see investors broaden their horizons. Some of this diversification away from technology stocks has already taken place in the form of impressive performance by utility stocks in 2024. Their performance is evident through the utility component of the flagship S&P index gaining 28% from the start of the year to the end of November as it led the benchmark index by a percentage point. We analyzed this stage in AI investment in great detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks. Stocks in this list range from utility firms to computer hardware providers, semiconductor firms, and glass companies. Within this list, data center hardware firms were quite common, and as you read below, you'll find out why they might be the biggest beneficiaries of the next wave in AI investment. Wells Fargo has extensively covered the topic of what other stocks apart from the most valuable in the world can benefit from artificial intelligence. Its research covers firms that benefit from AI spending and applications. Starting from stocks that might benefit from AI spending, the bank notes that these will primarily include areas where the money trickles from AI data spending. In 2025, it estimates that hyperscaler cloud providers' capital expenditures can sit around a cool $180 billion. This is more than twice the expected spending by oil majors, which is estimated to sit at close to $85 billion. So where will this money trickle down to? Well, WF believes that while the "largest portion of cost involved in constructing data centers is graphics processing units (GPUs) and the supercomputers that contain them," other sectors that should not be ignored include "cabling; steel racks; cooling (liquid and air); electrical equipment (both inside and outside the box); and backup generators" along with others that "are required to lay the foundation and power generation to support the facility." While it lists down the usual culprits of information technology, communications services, and software firms that are part of discretionary stocks as the beneficiaries of data center spending, WF also adds two other sectors. These are industrial and material stocks, as the bank believes that while a "data center may not be a factory, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it might be a duck." It quotes research to share that since as much as 45% of the cost of building a data center "is related to land, building shell, and basic building fit-out," firms that "supply steel, aggregates, cement, and water equipment and, by extension, construction and engineering firms as well as broad non-residential construction suppliers (such as industrial distributors)" can benefit from the $180 billion in estimated hyperscaler capital expenditure. WF adds that data center spending will also include electrical and HVAC systems, as it notes that this sector can benefit from the fact that "there are a relatively limited number of scaled suppliers of large electrical equipment, commercial HVAC systems, and diesel generators."

A close-up of a group of technicians working on complex data center systems. To make our list of stocks that will benefit from AI, we ranked the stocks part of our list of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. This upgrades the list since it was published when the latest hedge fund data was unavailable and it narrows down the list of stocks to the top fund favorites. Why are we interested in stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 91 Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) is a computer hardware company that designs and sells power management, racks, cooling equipment, and other associated equipment. It is one of the top-performing stocks in 2024 as the shares are up 180% year-to-date. Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) has been an investor favorite particularly since it also sells liquid cooling products. These are indispensable for AI workloads due to the excessive heat generated by performance-intensive GPUs. The firm is particularly exposed to the data center industry as it generates 75% of its revenue from this industry. The positive catalysts from AI-generated demand were also evident in Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT)'s third quarter results. These saw the firm grow sales by 19% and orders by 37%. Therefore, the year-to-date share price gain is unsurprising. Baron Small Cap Fund mentioned Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) is a leader in data center equipment, with significant share in both power and cooling applications. The stock rebounded off recent weakness, as investors gained confidence that a massive build out of AI data centers globally was on the horizon. Vertiv’s strong relationship with chip manufacturers and involvement in the necessary technology roadmap for solutions as the energy density of server racks increases were catalysts. Vertiv’s orders were up 57% year-over-year in the second quarter, backlog was $7 billion, a record, and 2024 operating profit margin and EPS guidance was raised.” Overall, VRT ranks 9th on our list of stocks that will benefit from AI. While we acknowledge the potential of VRT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VRT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

World Labs, a startup co-founded by Stanford A.I. pioneer Fei-Fei Li earlier this year that quickly grabbed the attention of high-profile investors, has remained relatively quiet on its products—until now. The startup yesterday (Dec. 3) provided a glimpse of one of its early projects, which takes the form of virtual 3D scenes generated from a 2D image. “This will change how we make movies, games, simulators and other digital manifestations of our physical worlds,” said World Labs in a blog post accompanied by interactive examples of its 3D worlds. The preview shines a light on Li’s larger efforts to develop A.I. models that have “spatial intelligence” and can understand and interact with the real world. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Based on images of landscapes, urban scenes and even artwork from painters like Vincent van Gogh and Edward Hopper, World Labs creates entire 3D worlds that users can explore—albeit with some barriers, such as a limit on how large the interactive area is. According to the startup, this 3D content provides more control than typical 2D A.I. content, as it allows users to adjust aspects like field of depth or play with camera dolly zooms. Often referred to as the “Godmother of A.I.” for her contributions to the field, Li in the 2000s played a large role in the release of ImageNet, a database of 15 million images that helped kickstart pivotal advances in machine learning. She is currently on partial leave from her role as co-director of Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered A.I. to work on World Labs, which Li established earlier this year alongside fellow A.I. researchers Justin Johnson, Ben Mildenhall and Christoph Lassner. The startup in September raised some $230 million in a round led by Radical Ventures, a Canadian venture capital firm where Li serves as a partner, with the participation of Andreessen Horowitz and NEA. Other World Lab investors include “A.I. godfather” Geoffrey Hinton, former Google (GOOGL) CEO Eric Schmidt, LinkedIn (LNKD) co-founder Reid Hoffman, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Google’s chief scientist Jeff Dean, actor-turned-investor Ashton Kutcher, and Nvidia (NVDA)’s venture capital arm, NVentures. World Labs’ primary goal is developing the ability to take action with vision or perception within A.I. models—a type of intelligence that took 540 million years to evolve in the human brain. “If we want to advance A.I. beyond its current capabilities, we want more than A.I. that can see and talk. We want A.I. that can do,” Li said during a TED Talk in April. This week’s initial preview is just an early look at what World Labs hopes to eventually accomplish. The company said it has offered early access to its technology to digital content creators like Eric Solorio and Brittani Natali. “We are hard at work improving the size and fidelity of our generated worlds, and experimenting with new ways for users to interact with them,” said World Labs.

Title: Why Vistra Corp. (VST) Will Be a Major Beneficiary of AI

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Stocks That Will Benefit From AI. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) stands against other stocks that will benefit from AI. Artificial intelligence has been the driving theme of the stock market over the past couple of years which have seen investors battle inflation and high interest rates. Ever since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT in November 2022 and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted the next year that there was a trillion-dollar market in play when it came to upgrading traditional computing hardware to accelerated computing, the stock market has seen no respite. However, when it comes to AI stocks, not all of them have flourished. Apart from Huang's firm, the world's leading graphics processing unit (GPU) designer, shares of OpenAI's biggest backer, i.e., the firm known for the Windows operating system, were two of the biggest initial AI beneficiaries. Between December 2022 and H1 2024, their shares have gained 631% and 75%, respectively. Other technology stocks have also ridden the AI wave and have posted gains ranging between 42% to 308%. Within these, the stock that has gained 308% is Facebook's parent entity and its focus on GPU investments and success with the Llama open source model have caught investor attention. These firms have primarily posted gains because the AI wave, as analysts would like to remind you, is in its early stages. This stage is characterized by investor interest in firms that are AI enablers. However, the next stage of AI investment could see investors broaden their horizons. Some of this diversification away from technology stocks has already taken place in the form of impressive performance by utility stocks in 2024. Their performance is evident through the utility component of the flagship S&P index gaining 28% from the start of the year to the end of November as it led the benchmark index by a percentage point. We analyzed this stage in AI investment in great detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks. Stocks in this list range from utility firms to computer hardware providers, semiconductor firms, and glass companies. Within this list, data center hardware firms were quite common, and as you read below, you'll find out why they might be the biggest beneficiaries of the next wave in AI investment. Wells Fargo has extensively covered the topic of what other stocks apart from the most valuable in the world can benefit from artificial intelligence. Its research covers firms that benefit from AI spending and applications. Starting from stocks that might benefit from AI spending, the bank notes that these will primarily include areas where the money trickles from AI data spending. In 2025, it estimates that hyperscaler cloud providers' capital expenditures can sit around a cool $180 billion. This is more than twice the expected spending by oil majors, which is estimated to sit at close to $85 billion. So where will this money trickle down to? Well, WF believes that while the "largest portion of cost involved in constructing data centers is graphics processing units (GPUs) and the supercomputers that contain them," other sectors that should not be ignored include "cabling; steel racks; cooling (liquid and air); electrical equipment (both inside and outside the box); and backup generators" along with others that "are required to lay the foundation and power generation to support the facility." While it lists down the usual culprits of information technology, communications services, and software firms that are part of discretionary stocks as the beneficiaries of data center spending, WF also adds two other sectors. These are industrial and material stocks, as the bank believes that while a "data center may not be a factory, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it might be a duck." It quotes research to share that since as much as 45% of the cost of building a data center "is related to land, building shell, and basic building fit-out," firms that "supply steel, aggregates, cement, and water equipment and, by extension, construction and engineering firms as well as broad non-residential construction suppliers (such as industrial distributors)" can benefit from the $180 billion in estimated hyperscaler capital expenditure. WF adds that data center spending will also include electrical and HVAC systems, as it notes that this sector can benefit from the fact that "there are a relatively limited number of scaled suppliers of large electrical equipment, commercial HVAC systems, and diesel generators."

Solar panel workers installing a new farm for clean energy generation. To make our list of stocks that will benefit from AI, we ranked the stocks part of our list of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.

(see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 97 Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is one of the top-performing stocks of 2024 as its shares are up by a whopping 305% year-to-date. It is a Texas-based utility, and as you might have guessed, the firm has wide exposure to the nuclear industry. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) also benefits from being an unregulated utility which enables it to self-set rate of returns on its power generation projects. The stock has risen in 2024 after the firm's decision to bring a nuclear business fully under its fold sent the shares soaring by 25%. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) also scored another win this year when regulators approved its request to extend the operational life of a nuclear power plant. For full-year 2024, the firm aims to earn between $5 billion to $5.2 in operating income and $2.65 billion to $2.85 billion in free cash flow. Along with deals with data center firms for clean energy and the regulatory environment for future projects, these also play an important role in Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)'s story. Meridian Funds mentioned Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: "Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is an integrated retail electricity and power generation company, primarily serving Texas and the Midwest. We own Vistra because we expect power markets to continue tightening as baseload supply declines, coupled with rising demand from data centers, electric vehicles, and manufacturing reshoring. These factors create a favorable pricing environment for Vistra’s generation fleet, especially its nuclear and gas assets. The stock performed well during the period for three key reasons: tightening energy markets and strengthened pricing in forward-year energy contracts, the continuation of Vistra’s aggressive share repurchase program, and the company’s announced plan to acquire the remaining interest in Vistra Vision at an attractive valuation. Additionally, the company reaffirmed its 2024 guidance, indicating that results are trending toward the upper end of the previously projected range. We took advantage of the stock’s strength this quarter to trim our position.” Overall, VST ranks 7th on our list of stocks that will benefit from AI. While we acknowledge the potential of VST as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Why BlackRock is turning even more bullish on US stocks for next year
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-blackrock-bullish-2025-ai-mega-forces-valuations-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-04T20:00:42Z
Full Content:
The world's largest asset manager says it's not too late to turn bullish on US stocks heading into 2025. In its outlook for the new year, BlackRock upgraded its "Overweight" rating on US stocks, turning even more bullish than its prior recommendation even as the S&P 500 trades at all-time highs. The firm was previously "+1" overweight relative to "Neutral" and is now "+2" overweight, with its highest overweight rating being "+3." BlackRock's recommendation to stay "pro-risk" toward US stocks is the opposite of Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett, who recommended this week that investors should bet on international stocks in 2025 due to the fear that America's exceptionalism trade is about to end. But BlackRock isn't buying it. "U.S. equities have persistently outpaced their global peers," BlackRock's Investment Institute wrote in their 2025 outlook. "We think that could continue." The driving force behind BlackRock's doubling down on the US stock market rally to continue is the belief that "mega forces" like artificial intelligence are disproportionately set to benefit American companies. "We think the AI mega force will benefit U.S. stocks more and that's why we stay overweight, particularly relative to international peers such as European stocks," BlackRock said. The firm also believes potential tax cuts and an easing regulatory environment under the incoming Donald Trump administration should support continued economic growth. One top concern for US stock market investors has been valuations, which, based on metrics like price-to-earnings ratios, are hitting historical extremes. However, BlackRock dismissed the valuation concern by highlighting that the US economy looks a lot different than it did in the past, as technology and services take center stage at the expense of manufacturing. "The equity market's changing sectoral composition reflects the transformation taking hold. So, comparing today's index to that of the past is like comparing apples to oranges," BlackRock said. Valuation measures have also proven to be a poor timing tool for getting in or out of the stock market, the firm said. "We are risk-on for now but stay nimble." The firm said factors that could force it to change its bullish tune include a significant surge in long-term bond yields or an escalation in trade protectionism.

Title: Intel’s CEO shakeup puts foundry plans, CHIPS Act cash at risk

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) is in crisis. The company forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger on Monday, its stock price is down more than 50% on the year, and the grand plan to add third-party semiconductor manufacturing to its repertoire is suddenly more unclear than ever. Gelsinger’s gambit to transform Intel into a US-based version of Taiwan’s TSMC that builds chips for its rivals is one of the reasons the company received $7.8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. But the foundry business, which it plans to operate as an independent subsidiary, has been hemorrhaging money and its biggest customer is still Intel itself. Yes, the company has picked up deals to build chips for Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), but that hasn’t quelled calls for Intel to kill its third-party foundry plan. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in an investor note that Intel could go as far as fully separating its design and manufacturing businesses. But ditching its fabs, or fabrication facilities, is a lot easier said than done, especially if Intel wants to hold on to those CHIPS Act funds. “They just got the CHIPS Acts money. And if you look very closely at the details, it basically says that Intel cannot sell more than a controlling share of the manufacturing footprint,” explained Mario Morales, group vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC. “So that means that Intel will have to maintain manufacturing control of their capacity.” In other words, there’s no easy path forward for the US’s largest homegrown chip builder. The Commerce Department and Intel announced the chipmaker would be getting CHIPS Act funding just last week, with the DoC saying the cash would help Intel expand its manufacturing capacity in the US, a key part of Gelsinger’s plan to help the company compete with TSMC and Samsung, two of the largest chipmakers in the world. Gelsinger initially unveiled the ambitious agenda, called IDM 2.0, or integrated device manufacturing 2.0, in 2021, the same year he took the reins as CEO. At the time, he said Intel would create a world-class foundry business. But Gelsinger took over an Intel beset by problems. Lack of investment and missed opportunities over the years meant the company failed to catch the mobile wave and fell behind TSMC in design capabilities. And building out a global manufacturing footprint isn’t cheap, which, for a company that was already hurting, wasn’t ideal. Gelsinger had four years to make the turnaround happen, and while Intel’s chip design process is catching up, building chip manufacturing facilities takes time, more than Intel’s board seemed interested in giving Gelsinger. “Some of the problems that Intel had, and still has, are not things you can solve overnight. They are multiyear issues,” said TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell. “Gelsinger started on a path to follow some of these things. And I think ultimately, at the highest level, what he chose to do, which is to get the manufacturing stuff back in shape and to work on design, is ultimately what the company needs to do.” Now Intel has to make a decision: carry on with Gelsinger’s plan or cut back and focus on its own chip building capabilities or give up the business entirely. But doing that means saying goodbye to CHIPS Act money unless it can get approval from the Commerce Department Under the terms of the CHIPS Act agreement, Intel is prohibited from certain change of control transactions. If the company spins off its foundry business, it has to hold on to at least 50.1% of the voting rights of the entity if it’s a private company. If the new entity goes public, a third party can’t own 35% or more of it. That means Intel can’t simply cut its foundry business loose and go fabless if it wants to hold on to that CHIPS money. But moving forward with the foundry model could be difficult. “I think as a combined entity it's hard to survive, because the biggest problem is your potential customers for foundry are all your competitors against Intel products,” explained Gartner analyst Gaurav Gupta. “So how would they have trust in Intel foundry and become its customers, right?” If Intel does end up pulling back on its third-party manufacturing ambitions, however, it could end up eating a good portion of the losses. “You'd have to scale back. You'd have to lay off people. I'm sure there would be some sunk cost, but the alternative is you keep losing billions of dollars a quarter,” Citi head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely told Yahoo Finance. “So, I think you just need to scrap it. Take your lumps. If you have to, return the money to the government.” While Danely believes Intel should drop its goal of serving as a global foundry for other companies, he says it should continue to build its own chips. “I still think they should manufacture their own CPUs,” he explained. "There's been speculation for a long time that they're just going to turn the keys over to [TSMC] and have [TSMC] make everything. We don't think that that's the right move.” Before that, however, Intel needs to find a new permanent CEO. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

In this must-watch video, Bev Turner explores how corporate corruption, global elites like Bill Gates, and powerful financial institutions like BlackRock are manipulating UK politics behind the scenes.

British civil servants ran the place for a very long time before the term Deep State came into currency. The idea was that the Ministries have a steady hand on the tiller despite the vacillations of elective politics. Power, as Lord Acton said, tends to corrupt. Don’t leave out the CFR or the Trilateral commision. I’ll wait till the TRIALS. Yes, democracy is just an illusion. They keeps telling us that we have one when in reality, it’s an oligarchy operating behind the scenes. bkmk The Deep State is, essentially, when every political party has allowed the revolving door of top executive branch insitutions to go on for so long that the top officials in those institutions and a great mass of the officials under them, see our elections as events that no longer concern them so much, they, what they think of as “the real government”, will survive, institutionally, intact, AND if anyone aspires to election to disrupt that, they will directly interfere in the election processes in order to keep their power unchecked. I think it is time for a wholesale do over. This is why Trump is a “threat to our democracy,” emphasis on “our”. Tree of Liberty must be watered by...? Our system isn’t much different in that regard.

British civil servants ran the place for a very long time before the term Deep State came into currency. The idea was that the Ministries have a steady hand on the tiller despite the vacillations of elective politics. Power, as Lord Acton said, tends to corrupt. Don’t leave out the CFR or the Trilateral commision. I’ll wait till the TRIALS. Yes, democracy is just an illusion. They keeps telling us that we have one when in reality, it’s an oligarchy operating behind the scenes. bkmk The Deep State is, essentially, when every political party has allowed the revolving door of top executive branch insitutions to go on for so long that the top officials in those institutions and a great mass of the officials under them, see our elections as events that no longer concern them so much, they, what they think of as “the real government”, will survive, institutionally, intact, AND if anyone aspires to election to disrupt that, they will directly interfere in the election processes in order to keep their power unchecked. I think it is time for a wholesale do over. This is why Trump is a “threat to our democracy,” emphasis on “our”. Tree of Liberty must be watered by...? Our system isn’t much different in that regard.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Farmland and Agriculture Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) stands against the other farmland and agriculture stocks. The farmland and agriculture sector is crucial for global food security and economic stability. As the world population continues to grow, the demand for food increases, necessitating innovative practices in agriculture and farming. Recent trends indicate a significant shift towards technology-driven agriculture, which aims to enhance productivity while promoting sustainability. In the first quarter of 2024, McKinsey surveyed around 4,400 farmers across Europe, India, Latin America, and North America to understand the factors influencing their profitability and technology adoption. The firm conducted a similar survey in 2022. The findings indicate that while farmers are increasingly adopting technology, the pace remains slow, with a three-percentage-point rise since 2022 in those using or willing to use at least one new digital tool to improve operations.

In the US, 61% of farmers are using or willing to adopt digital agronomy. Additionally, 51% are using or willing to adopt precision agriculture hardware, and 38% are adopting remote-sensing technologies. Latin America showed the most significant growth in technology adoption, with a remarkable ten-percentage-point increase from 2022 to 2024. Farmers around the world are more inclined to adopt new technologies that directly improve operations. According to the data, digital agronomy and precision agriculture hardware are the most popular technologies around the world. The survey highlights that in the US, larger farms are 45% more likely to adopt agricultural technology compared to smaller farms. This trend can be attributed to the greater scale needed for a favorable return on investment (ROI) in agtech. Despite the challenges posed by rising input costs and extreme weather conditions, farmers are looking towards sustainable practices and innovative technologies to enhance their productivity and profitability. Organizations that provide technology and services have a unique opportunity to cater to farmers’ diverse needs across different regions. To compile our list of the 13 best farmland and agriculture stocks to invest in according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest farmland and agriculture companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources. From an initial pool of more than 30 farmland and agriculture stocks, we focused on the top 13 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 13 best farmland and agriculture stocks to invest in are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Title: Why Is Kura Oncology, Inc. (KURA) Among the Best Small-Cap Biotech Stocks With Massive Potential According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Small-Cap Biotech Stocks with Massive Potential According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) stands against the other small-cap biotech stocks. The biotechnology sector is expanding quickly due to rising demand for novel therapies, technological advances, and government assistance. Advances in fields like gene editing, sequencing, personalized medicine, and artificial intelligence are making new techniques possible, while the aging population and growing healthcare demands are driving a robust market for new treatments. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, venture capital firms made approximately $52 billion in global investments in therapeutic-focused biotech companies between 2019 and 2021. Two-thirds of this sum was given to platform-tech start-up companies. Despite its growth, many biotech companies have faced challenges in turbulent markets, taking drastic measures such as cutting programs and implementing significant layoffs to conserve cash. While recent rate cuts could encourage the revival of scientific projects, analysts like Jared Holz note the difficulty of gauging their impact. Holz also highlighted a shift in market dynamics, observing that biotech's performance increasingly correlates with small-cap equities. If small-cap stocks trade well, biotech is likely to follow, though stagnation could occur if momentum fades. Notably, the idea of interest rates predicting biotech success is relatively new, emerging only after the pandemic, which reshaped the industry by driving substantial investment into therapeutic-focused companies. With innovative treatments, biotech businesses are revolutionizing healthcare by tackling important unmet medical needs. Establishing the National Bioeconomy Board as a component of Biden's Investing in America agenda is a significant breakthrough. It seeks to maximize biotechnology's economic potential in the United States. Furthermore, policy suggestions to expedite the approval process for biotechnology goods are being developed by the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology. More academics will be able to use biotechnology for agricultural purposes if entry obstacles are reduced, which will benefit American farmers and increase food security. It is anticipated that these initiatives will open up new markets. This year (2024) started strongly for the biotechnology sector due to a rise in mergers and acquisitions as well as anticipations of falling interest rates. Therefore, estimates suggest that the worldwide biotechnology market might increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 14% from 2024 to 2033, reaching an astonishing $5.7 trillion. The market for agricultural biotechnology is also expected to develop at a 7.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and reach $232 billion by 2032. But even with the market's potential, investing in biotech companies still carries a number of serious dangers. Bankruptcy may result from failing to satisfy clinical trial endpoints or obtain adequate finance before a product launch. In the biotech industry, where drug development usually takes more than ten years and has an estimated failure rate of about 90%, the danger of failure is very substantial. Hence, biotech stocks are often considered “high-risk, high-reward” investments due to their upside potential coupled with significant risks In our methodology, we identified the top small-cap biotech stocks with significant growth potential, ranked according to their total hedge fund holdings as of Q2 2024. Our selection process began by filtering companies with a small market capitalization. Next, we reviewed analyst recommendations, focusing on stocks with strong bullish sentiment and high institutional ownership. Finally, we ranked these companies based on the number of hedge funds holding their shares as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A biopharmaceutical researcher intently studying results from a clinical trial. Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 36 Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing precision medicines for the treatment of cancer. At its core, the company designs and develops targeted therapies that aim to improve outcomes for patients with various types of solid tumors and blood cancers. A major catalyst for Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) is the development of ziftomenib, its lead drug candidate. Ziftomenib, an oral medication targeting the menin-MLL1 protein-protein interaction, has received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for patients with relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This designation could accelerate the drug's path to market, potentially leading to increased revenue and market share. Another catalyst is the company's expanding clinical trial program. The corporation has completed enrollment in a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of ziftomenib (KOMET-001) and is conducting multiple clinical trials to evaluate ziftomenib in combination with current standard-of-care regimens. Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) reported significant financial developments in Q3 2024, with research and development expenses increasing to $41.7 million from $29.3 million in Q3 2023 which was driven by higher clinical trial costs for key programs such as ziftomenib and KO-2806. General and administrative expenses also rose to $18.2 million from $13.1 million, contributing to a net loss of $54.4 million, up from $38.6 million in the prior year. The company maintains a strong cash position of $455.3 million, ensuring operational funding into 2027. As of the third quarter of 2024, 36 hedge funds had investments in the company, with Suvretta Capital Management being the largest shareholder, holding stakes valued at $149.5 million, according to the Insider Monkey database. Analysts on Wall Street have a consensus Strong Buy rating for the stock. Over the past three months, analysts have set a 12-month price target of $30.89, with estimates ranging from a low of $22.00 to a high of $37.00. This represents a potential upside of 52.47% from the current price of $20.26. Overall KURA ranks 2nd on our list of the best small-cap biotech stocks with massive potential according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of KURA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The market for agricultural biotechnology is also expected to develop at a 7.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and reach $232 billion by 2032. But even with the market's potential, investing in biotech companies still carries a number of serious dangers. Bankruptcy may result from failing to satisfy clinical trial endpoints or obtain adequate finance before a product launch. In the biotech industry, where drug development usually takes more than ten years and has an estimated failure rate of about 90%, the danger of failure is very substantial. Hence, biotech stocks are often considered “high-risk, high-reward” investments due to their upside potential coupled with significant risks In our methodology, we identified the top small-cap biotech stocks with significant growth potential, ranked according to their total hedge fund holdings as of Q2 2024. Our selection process began by filtering companies with a small market capitalization. Next, we reviewed analyst recommendations, focusing on stocks with strong bullish sentiment and high institutional ownership. Finally, we ranked these companies based on the number of hedge funds holding their shares as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A biopharma executive in a meeting room discussing the clinical-stage of a new therapy. Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 34 Arvinas, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARVN) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that specializes in developing innovative protein degradation therapeutics. At its core, the company focuses on creating drugs that harness the body's natural protein disposal system to selectively remove disease-causing proteins. A major catalyst for Arvinas, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARVN) is its robust clinical pipeline, particularly its lead candidate vepdegestrant (ARV-471). This PROTAC protein degrader is being investigated for treating ER+/HER2- breast cancer. Clinical trials have yielded encouraging results, with a Phase 1b trial demonstrating a clinical benefit rate of 63% and an overall response rate of 41.9% among heavily pretreated patients. These outcomes have prompted the initiation of several Phase 3 trials, including VERITAC-2 and VERITAC-3, which could pave the way for regulatory approval if successful. The company has shown impressive growth since its market debut in 2016, when it raised about $120 million through the issuance of approximately 7.5 million shares at $16 per share. The stock has experienced significant volatility, with notable gains in recent years. For instance, shares surged from around $22 in November 2023 to approximately $29, marking an impressive gain of nearly 35%. Arvinas, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARVN) has emerged as one of the best biotech stocks, gaining notable hedge fund interest. The company reported impressive Q3 2024 financial results, with revenue surging to $102.4 million from $34.6 million in Q3 2023 which was driven primarily by $76.7 million from the Novartis license agreement, which offset declines in collaborations with Pfizer and Bayer. The corporation maintains a strong cash position of $1.1 billion, ensuring an operational runway into 2027. R&D expenses rose slightly to $86.9 million from $85.9 million, while G&A expenses increased significantly to $75.8 million from $22.6 million, reflecting strategic investments. As of Q3 2024, 34 hedge funds held stakes in Arvinas, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARVN), with EcoR1 Capital being the largest shareholder, holding $165.7 million in the company, according to the Insider Monkey database. Analysts have a consensus Strong Buy rating on the company, with an average price target of $61.14, ranging from a low of $48.00 to a high of $87.00. This represents a potential upside of 144.85% from the current price of $24.97. Overall ARVN ranks 3rd on our list of the best small-cap biotech stocks with massive potential according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of ARVN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ARVN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The Scoop: Edelman cuts 5% of workforce

Also: UnitedHealthcare responds after CEO fatally shot during meeting; American adults view media as being as biased as ever. Edelman is laying off 330 staff members, or over 5% of its workforce, as part of a global restructuring effort. The global PR agency also plans to sunset several of its subsidiary boutique agencies. [RELATED: Join us March 19-21 for Ragan’s Social Media Conference at Walt Disney World] As part of its company announcement, CEO Richard Edelman issued a statement to the company (and the broader industry) providing context about the “simplification of our firm’s structure.” “Clients now require integration of specialist services into the larger firm for speedy access to our geographic reach, deep industry knowledge and creative ability,” the statement reads. “We are best when we bring the full force of Edelman to the complex problems facing our clients. Corporate affairs, marketing and government affairs are now all closely aligned on the client side. We are skating to where the puck will be — everything is interconnected now.” As part of a restructuring, Edelman will shutter Edible, Revere, Salutem, Mustache, EGA and Delta brands. However, it plans to keep open three of its specialty arms: Edelman Smithfield (financial communications), DXI (research) and UEG (experiential marketing). Those boutique firms will serve as the “connective tissue” between Edelman and the related Zeno Group and RUTH. The agency will also maintain two client-specific entities — Assembly for Microsoft and Kinisi for J&J. Edelman plans to keep open its 60 global offices. Why it matters: Edelman is one of the biggest players in the PR game, and if it’s making a move, it’s important for the entire industry to take note. In this context, that appears to be moving – or “skating,” as Richard Edelman described it – toward a more integrated model. As Axios reported, Edelman is working “to take money away from classic marketing agencies and compete for budgets that [they] couldn’t have before.” But the changes are also about becoming more “nimble and agile.” While still a $1 billion revenue business, Edelman saw its revenue drop by about 8% last year – and further efficiency would likely help change that trend. It’s not clear if the growth of artificial intelligence is part of that changing model or the cuts in staff. But Edelman has emphasized its commitment to investing in its own AI technology. “We are investing in our own large language model premised on 25 years of Trust data that enables AI as a predictive tool, both communications and action, enabling better decisions by business related to trust,” Richard Edelman said. Following the downsizing, he told Axios positions affected by the downsizing “about evenly split” between “vice president and up” and “account executive to account supervisor.” But he also stressed in his company statement to deliver on client needs “with senior people leading every engagement.” That suggests the Edelman team really wants to use in-house staff time on strategy when and where possible. To that end, Edelman has hired over 200 creative employees in Colombia and plans to staff up in India and South Africa, per Axios. Keep an eye on next steps for Edelman, as it could be a strong sign of what’s in store for the industry. Editor’s Top News A newly released survey from the Pew Research Center suggests the overwhelming majority of American adults believe mainstream news coverage has a bias when discussing political or social issues. The September survey, which published Monday, found that 77% of U.S. adults believe news organizations tend to go either left or right when presenting on those topics. That number represents about nine-in-ten Republicans (88%), compared with 67% of Democrats. Far fewer (22%) believe news organizations deal fairly with all sides. The poll is near the highest share of Americans who say so since it started in 1985. In an era where people are increasingly turning to social media influencers and podcasts over traditional news, this poses a challenge for traditional earned media. Trust is key, and if a team can’t trust the reporter or their perspective on a particular subject, it won’t resonate with target audiences as it should. This doesn’t mean you should give up on your earned media strategy entirely. But now, as much as ever, PR teams must thoroughly vet the reporters and publications and closely examine sentiment scores. Casey Weldon is a reporter for PR Daily. Follow him on LinkedIn. Topics: Daily Scoop Topics: Daily Scoop As someone familiar with Edelman, I can confirm the number is closer to 500 employees. Considering the company’s reported financial challenges, there’s been speculation among staff about the necessity and timing of Nikki Haley’s hire three months ago, given that her compensation is likely significant.

Title: Sam Altman isn't worried about Elon Musk's relationship with Donald Trump

As his former colleague and artificial intelligence rival prepares for a role in the incoming Trump administration, Sam Altman says he’s not worried about Elon Musk. Despite there being “lots of things not to like about” Musk, it would go against the billionaire’s values to hurt competitors, the OpenAI chief executive said during an interview at the New York Times (NYT+0.37%) DealBook Summit on Wednesday. “I may turn out to be wrong, but I believe pretty strongly that Elon will do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power, to the degree that Elon has it, to hurt your competitors and advantage your own businesses,” Altman said. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA-0.44%) reported that Altman and other tech and business leaders who have drawn Musk’s ire are worried about the influence he could have on regulation. Altman reportedly reached out to his connections in Trump’s circle, including the President-elect’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and his brother, Joshua Kushner, head of major OpenAI investor Thrive Capital. Altman also reportedly asked a mutual friend to set up a meeting with Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for commerce secretary. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 before leaving over a conflict of interest in 2018, announced in September that his AI startup, xAI, had brought “the most powerful AI training system in the world” online after only 122 days. The Colossus training cluster is powered by 100,000 Nvidia (NVDA-0.04%) H100 training chips and “will double in size” “in a few months” to 200,000 chips, including 50,000 of the more powerful Nvidia H200 chips, Musk said. Altman said he assumes xAI will “be a really serious competitor” to OpenAI. “I have different feelings about him [Musk] now, but I’m still glad he exists,” Altman said. “Not just because I think his companies are awesome, which I do think, but because I think he, at a time when most of the world was not thinking very ambitiously, he pushed a lot of people, me included, to think much more ambitiously.” Additionally, Altman said ChatGPT’s search feature is his “favorite product we’ve launched in a long time,” and that OpenAI will announce new launches and demos for the next 12 business days starting on Thursday.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks. AI companies in Europe are competing with American counterparts for a larger slice of the AI cake in Asia and the Middle East. For example, French AI firm LightOn recently revealed plans to expand in the Middle East, targeting sectors such as banking, defense, and high-tech which require their data to be protected on local servers. According to a report by news agency Reuters, Laurent Daudet, the CEO of the firm, noted that banking, insurance, high-tech, defense, and healthcare were prime targets for the custom AI models from LightOn. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The report further highlights that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and neighbouring countries were among those being looked at by LightOn. The AI firms just recently debuted on the stock market, becoming the first listed genAI company on the Euronext Growth exchange. The demand for LightOn products is growing.

This shift, per Clark, has big implications for NVIDIA.

Title: The Dow gains 200 points as Salesforce and other tech stocks rise

The Dow surged nearly 300 points on Wednesday, driven by gains in Salesforce and other tech stocks. In the afternoon, the Dow climbed 272 points or 0.6%. The S&P 500 added 0.5%, while the Nasdaq rose by 1.1%. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached fresh record highs, signaling continued optimism in the equity markets. Moreover, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in the afternoon that the Fed can proceed “cautiously” while reducing interest rates. The central bank’s next meeting to discuss rate cuts is scheduled for December 17-18.

That could be an ominous sign for the market, and for the funds themselves as glitches emerge. Leveraged single stock ETFs hit a record of $17 billion of trading volume on Nov. 21, according Strategas ETF strategist Todd Sohn. Several issuers have launched these funds in recent years, typically tracking stocks with high volatility like Nvidia, Tesla and MicroStrategy. "The entire leveraged cohort is just 0.4% of U.S. ETF AUM, but with trading volume as % of total constantly flirting with the 8-9% range recently – that's up from 4% at the start of the year and we find the growth rate curious with equities trading at an all-time high," Sohn said in a note to clients last week. The volume would seem more likely to spike during downturns in the market, when general volatility rises, not well into a bull market, Sohn said. Their recent popularity could be a warning sign about euphoria among some investors. "Pair this off with the continued surge of inflows to equity ETFs and it creates a developing case of hot sentiment. Keep in mind – year 3 of a bull market is often a trickier backdrop than the initial years off major market lows," Sohn said. Similarly, Morningstar senior analyst Daniel Sotiroff told CNBC the rise of these types of leveraged funds funds is indicative of a "gambling mentality" in the market and that investors would be better off avoiding them altogether. For now, the broader Wall Street rally is still intact, but there are new signs of strain for some of the single stock ETFs. One of the big concerns around leveraged funds in general is that they are only designed to meet their stated return on a daily basis. Because of a characteristic often called "volatility drift," investors can expect leveraged long funds in particular to underperform the goal on the label over longer time horizons. But the soaring popularity of leveraged funds for MicroStrategy in particular has surfaced a different problem: the funds are struggling to track the volatile crypto-linked stock on even a daily basis. Return data from FactSet shows that, in the five trading days leading up to Thanksgiving, two major leveraged long MicroStrategy funds had multiple trading sessions where their return differed from the stated goal by more than 2 percentage points. The single stock funds typically buy swap agreements from banks to lock in the leveraged exposure. However, the T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF (MSTU) and the Defiance Daily Target 2X Long MSTR ETF (MSTX) have both turned to options to generate leverage in recent days because there wasn't enough supply in the swaps market, the firms behind the funds confirmed to CNBC, which could make it more difficult to achieve the goals of the funds. The two funds have more than $4 billion in combined assets, according to their websites. The heavy demand for the funds, combined with the high volatility of MicroStrategy itself, appears to be scaring off financial firms from helping facilitate these leveraged bets on the stock with swaps. "Every strategy has its limits at some point. Sometimes it's like a structural thing where the market just cannot handle any more, like you're kind of seeing now. Sometimes its more based on the particulars of the strategy," Sotiroff said. Despite the recent issues, the single stock ETF boom is still growing. On Tuesday, Defiance launched the Daily Target 2X Long NVO ETF (NVOX), giving leveraged exposure to the stock of obesity drug maker Novo Nordisk. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Pick This Drone Maker Over AXON Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/04/pick-this-drone-maker-over-axon-stock/
Time Published: 2024-12-04T14:56:25Z
Full Content:
DORTMUND, GERMANY - JANUARY 15: A police officer demonstrates the handling of an Taser on January ... [+] 15, 2021 in Dortmund, Germany. Police in North Rhine-Westphalia will begin using the Axon Taser 7 electroshock devices in a two-year pilot project, after which authorities will assess whether the devices will become standard issue. Similar pilot projects are underway in other German states. (Photo by Sascha Schuermann/Getty Images) We believe that AeroVironment stock,, a drone and uncrewed vehicle maker, is a better pick than its industry peer, Axon Enterprise stock (NASDAQ: AXON), best known for its products for the law enforcement agencies, including taser and body cams. AXON stock trades at 27x trailing revenues, versus 7x for AVAV stock, thanks to Axon’s superior revenue growth and profitability. However, we think this gap in valuation will narrow in favor of AeroVironment in the coming years. There is more to the comparison, and in the sections below, we compare a slew of factors, such as historical revenue growth, returns, and valuation for these stocks. Separately, check out Why Is Salesforce Stock Up 12%? AXON stock has seen stellar gains of 435% from levels of $125 in early January 2021 to around $670 now, vs. an increase of 130% for AVAV stock. This compares with about 60% gains for the broader S&P 500 index over this roughly four-year period. Admirably, AXON stock has outperformed the broader market in each of the last three years. Returns for the stock were 28% in 2021, 6% in 2022, and 56% in 2023. This was not the case for AeroVironment, with its stock seeing returns of -29%, 38%, and 47% in the last three years, respectively. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 – indicating that AVAV underperformed the S&P in 2021. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Industrials sector including MMM, UPS, and HON, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Axon has seen its revenue rise at an average annual rate of 32% from $681 million in 2020 to $1.9 billion now. On the other hand, AeroVironment’s average revenue growth rate of 22% from $395 million in fiscal 2021 (fiscal ends in April) to $754 million now, has been comparatively slower. Also see, What’s Happening With PFE Stock? Axon’s revenue growth lately has been led by increased demand for taser and body cams. The company is benefiting from increased adoption for its products, amid continued innovation. For example, Axon’s Draft One uses generative AI to convert the audio from the body cam into a report narrative draft. Also, it can translate over 100 languages. Such offerings help improve the efficiency of the police force. Looking at the latest quarter, Axon’s sales were up a solid 32% y-o-y, driven by a 36% jump in its Cloud & Services business, while Sensors & Other revenue was up 18%. AeroVironment’s revenue growth lately is being driven by its uncrewed systems and loitering munitions systems (kamikaze drones). The loitering munitions systems sales were up a whopping 60% y-o-y in fiscal 2024, while the uncrewed systems revenue were up 30%. Given the elevated geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Europe, there is an increased demand for uncrewed systems, bolstering AeroVironment’s top-line growth. AeroVironment’s Switchblade are employed in Ukraine. Just a few months back, the U.S. army awarded a $1 billion contract to AeroVironment for its kamikaze drones. Looking forward, we expect both companies to see strong revenue growth in the coming years. Still, we think Axon is likely to fare better, with its sales expected to nearly double from $1.6 billion in 2023 to around $3 billion in 2026. We think AeroVironment’s sales could rise by over 40% over this period. Axon’s operating margin declined from 63% in 2020 to 51% in 2023, while AeroVironment’s operating margin contracted from 11% in fiscal 2021 to 10% in fiscal 2024. If we look at the last twelve-month period, Axon’s operating margin of 54% fares much better than 9% for AeroVironment. Looking at financial risk, Axon has an edge over AeroVironment. Although its 1% debt as a percentage of equity is similar to AeroVironment, its 33% cash as a percentage of assets is much higher than 8% for the latter. This implies that both companies have a good debt position, but Axon has more cash cushion. While Axon has a better revenue growth, is more profitable, and offers lower financial risk, its stock has run up quite a bit. It’s up a stellar 160% this year, of which, over a 55% move came in a month. We think AXON is now slightly overpriced. At its current levels of $670, AXON trades at 27x trailing revenues, which is much higher than the stock’s average P/S ratio of 12x over the last three years. Now, some rise in valuation multiple seems warranted, given the strong sales and earnings growth. An increased adoption of its products bodes well for the stock in the long run, given that the company earns recurring revenues from sales of cartridges and services for its products. Furthermore, with Trump in the White House, law enforcement agencies are expected to be well funded under the new administration. There is a possibility of increased spending on technologies and products to improve security. Now, this factor bodes well for both Axon and AeroVironment. In comparison, AVAV stock, at levels of $193, trades at 7x trailing revenues, slightly higher than the stock’s average P/S ratio of 6x over the last three years. With increasing geopolitical uncertainty, the demand for drones may remain high. This implies more sales of drones. Ukraine is employing AeroVironment’s drones, Israel also received hundreds of kamikaze drones. The latest $1 billion contract from the U.S. army also reflects the increasing demand for drones. We think AVAV stock deserves an upward revision in valuation multiple. Notably, the $228 average of analysts’ price estimate reflects nearly a 20% upside from the current levels and factors an 8x P/S ratio. While AVAV looks a better pick over AXON, it is helpful to see other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons. Separately, look at Why Is Salesforce Stock Up 12%?

Title: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit Lowest Level in Years Amid Whale Accumulation
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/12/bitcoin-exchange-reserves-hit-lowest-level-in-years-amid-whale-accumulation/
Time Published: 2024-12-04T14:27:00Z

* Bitcoin exchange reserves have decreased to their lowest level in years due to significant outflows since the US presidential election. * The outflows are attributed to the cryptocurrency market rally following Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance during the campaign. * Bitcoin whales have been accumulating BTC, with 16,000 BTC worth nearly $1.5 billion entering whale reserves in a single day. The total amount of Bitcoin exchange reserves has dropped to its lowest level in years after massive outflows have been seen since the US presidential election in early November led to a massive cryptocurrency market rally. According to data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, over 171,000 BTC have moved off of cryptocurrency trading platforms since Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won the election, leading to a market rally given his pro-crypto stance during the campaign. The firm’s data notably shows there has been a steady decline in Bitcoin exchange reserves since the beginning of this year, as there were then around 3 million BTC on cryptocurrency exchanges. The figure has since plunged to around 2.64 million coins. As CryptoGlobe reported, Bitcoin whales have been steadily accumulating over the last few weeks as BTC trades below the psychological resistance level around $100,000. CryptoQuant data shows that 16,000 BTC worth nearly $1.5 billion entered whale reserves in a single day late last month. A lower amount of Bitcoin on exchanges suggests that there is less supply available on the market, which if coupled with steady or rising demand could lead to a cryptocurrency price rise. The price of Bitcoin has been strolling to surpass the $100,000 psychological barrier after surging exponentially after Trump secured the US elections. The cryptocurrency is at the time of writing trading at $96.700 after moving up more than 40% in the last month. While whales are accumulating, the total holdings of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) offered by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, have grown to surpass the 500,000 BTC mark. Another entity heavily accumulating the flagship cryptocurrency is Nasdaq-listed business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which accumulated an additional 15,400 coins for $1.5 billion earlier this month to bring its total BTC holdings above the 400,000 threshold.

New offerings position Invesco as the provider with the most expansive set of ETF assets that access unique exposures of the groundbreaking companies within Nasdaq Indexes ATLANTA, Dec. 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Invesco Ltd . (NYSE: NYSE:IVZ), a leading global asset management firm, announced today the expansion of the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite to include Invesco Top QQQ ETF (QBIG) and Invesco QQQ Low Volatility ETF (QQLV). The newest additions to the firm's popular family of QQQ strategies further positions the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite as the most expansive set of ETFs, by assets under management (AUM)1, to offer unique and varied exposures to the innovative companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index ®. "We're excited that the longstanding partnership between Nasdaq and Invesco continues to result in the launch of unique, innovative ETFs, positioning Invesco as the leading provider of Nasdaq-100 ETFs1," says Brian Hartigan, Invesco's Global Head of ETFs & Index Investments. "QBIG and QQLV will offer investors additional ways to access to the Nasdaq Indexes that meet their desired investment outcomes. These ETFs further advance the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite as a 'one stop shop' for innovation that offers investors a range of differentiated ETFs." The ETFs offer different exposures to the Nasdaq-100 Index, giving investors an opportunity to either access high beta or low beta versions of the Nasdaq-100 Index and providing options for both potential greater upside capture or potential downside mitigation. The two strategies consider the ever-changing economic landscape by giving shareholders two unique exposures to forward-thinking companies within the Nasdaq-100 Index. QBIG is an actively managed ETF that uses a rules-based approach to track the Nasdaq-100 Mega™ Index ®, which captures the top 45% of companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index. Invesco believes this approach is the most effective way to gain targeted exposure to innovation through high growth, mega-cap companies. Focusing on the top 45%, rather than specific named companies or a specific number of companies such as the "Magnificent 72," or previously, "FANMAG3" and "FAANG4", allows QBIG to be prepared for any potential shifts that may occur in the mega-cap landscape. QBIG's methodology adjusts on a quarterly basis for the inevitable and continuously evolving fluctuations in the composition of the largest companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index over a longer time horizon. QQLV is the first ETF in the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite to offer exposure to low volatility companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index. The passively managed fund tracks the Nasdaq-100 Low Volatility™ Index ®, which identifies the least volatile companies over the trailing 12 months within the Nasdaq-100 Index, offering investors access to growth companies within the Nasdaq-100 Index determined to have lower volatility. "Invesco and Nasdaq have been breaking new ground together for years, and we are excited to partner on two new additions to the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite," said Emily Spurling, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Index at Nasdaq. "For nearly 40 years, our flagship Nasdaq-100 Index has been the benchmark for innovation, and we are pleased Invesco can offer investors access to the concentrated companies in the Nasdaq-100 Mega Index and low volatility factor captured by the Nasdaq-100 Low Volatility Index." With the launch of QBIG and QQLV, investors now have a robust suite of ETFs that access different exposures and strategies of the Nasdaq Indexes. QQLV offers exposure to the Nasdaq-100 Index ® in a more conservative style, and could complement QBIG by offering an opportunity to invest in both ends of the Nasdaq-100 Index beta spectrum. QQLV also offers juxtaposition to the concentration risk of holding the largest mega-cap companies of the Nasdaq-100 Index.

An investment cannot be made directly into an index. About Risk: There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Index-based ETFs are not actively managed. Actively managed ETFs do not necessarily seek to replicate the performance of a specified index. Both index-based and actively managed ETFs are subject to risks similar to stocks, including those related to short selling and margin maintenance. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. Investments focused in a particular sector, such as information technology, are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. In general, equity values fluctuate, sometimes widely, in response to activities specific to the company as well as general market, economic and political conditions. QQLV Investments focused in a particular sector are subject to greater risk and are more greatly impacted by market volatility than more diversified investments. There is no assurance that the Fund will provide low volatility. The Fund may become "non-diversified," as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, solely as a result of a change in relative market capitalization or index weighting of one or more constituents of the Index. Shareholder approval will not be sought when the Fund crosses from diversified to non-diversified status under such circumstances. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not utilize an investing strategy that seeks returns in excess of its Underlying Index. Therefore, the Fund would not necessarily buy or sell a security unless that security is added or removed, respectively, from its Underlying Index, even if that security generally is underperforming. QBIG Market Risk. Securities held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations. You should anticipate that the value of the Shares will decline, more or less, in correlation with any decline in value of the securities in the Fund's portfolio. Additionally, natural or environmental disasters, widespread disease or other public health issues, war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, economic crises or other events could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's net asset value ("NAV"). Management Risk. The Fund is subject to management risk because a portion of its assets are actively managed. In managing certain of the Fund's investment sleeves and other portfolio holdings, the Adviser applies investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment and asset allocation decisions for the Fund, but there can be no guarantee that these actions will produce the desired results. Index Risk. While a portion of the Fund's portfolio is actively managed, another portion of the Fund's portfolio is designed to track the performance of the Index. In managing this portion of the Fund's portfolio, the portfolio managers will not generally buy or sell a security unless that security is added or removed, respectively, from the Index, regardless of the performance of that security. If a specific security is removed from the Index, the Fund may be forced to sell such security at an inopportune time or for a price lower than the security's current market value. The Index may not contain the appropriate mix of securities for any particular economic cycle. Equity Risk. In general, equity values fluctuate, sometimes widely, in response to activities specific to the company as well as general market, economic and political conditions. Swap Agreements Risk. Swaps involve greater risks than direct investments. Swaps are subject to leveraging, liquidity and counterparty risks, and therefore may be difficult to value. Adverse changes in the value or level of the swap can result in gains or losses that are substantially greater than invested, with the potential for unlimited loss. Industry Concentration Risk. Investments focused in a particular industry are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. Technology Industry Risk. Investments focused in a particular sector, such as technology, are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives may be more volatile and less liquid than traditional investments and are subject to market, interest rate, credit, leverage, counterparty and management risks. An investment in a derivative could lose more than the cash amount invested. Futures Contracts Risk. Risks of futures contracts include: an imperfect correlation between the value of the futures contract and the underlying commodity; possible lack of a liquid secondary market; inability to close a futures contract when desired; losses due to unanticipated market movements; obligation for the Fund to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin; failure to close a position may result in the Fund receiving an illiquid commodity; and unfavorable execution prices. Counterparty Risk. Counterparty risk is the risk that the other party to the contract will not fulfill its contractual obligations, which may cause losses or additional costs. Leverage Risk. Leverage created from borrowing or certain types of transactions or instruments may impair the fund's liquidity, cause it to liquidate positions at an unfavorable time or lose more than it invested, increase volatility or otherwise not achieve its intended objective. Cash/Cash Equivalent Risk. To the extent the Fund holds cash or cash equivalents rather than securities or other instruments in which it primarily invests, the Fund risks losing opportunities to participate in market appreciation and may experience potentially lower returns. Collateral Securities Risk. Collateral may include obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies and instrumentalities, including bills, notes and bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury, money market funds and corporate debt securities, such as commercial paper. Although the Fund may hold securities that carry U.S. government guarantees, these guarantees do not extend to shares of the Fund. Money market funds are subject to management fees and other expenses. Therefore, investments in money market funds will cause the Fund to bear indirectly a proportional share of the fees and costs of the money market funds in which it invests. At the same time, the Fund will continue to pay its own management fees and expenses with respect to all of its assets, including any portion invested in the shares of the money market fund. It is possible to lose money by investing in money market funds. Corporate debt securities such as commercial paper generally are short-term unsecured promissory notes issued by businesses. Corporate debt may be rated investment-grade or below investment-grade and may carry variable, or floating, rates of interest. Corporate debt securities carry both credit risk and interest rate risk. Credit risk is the risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer of a corporate debt security is unable to pay interest or repay principal when it is due. Some corporate debt securities that are rated below investment-grade generally are considered speculative because they present a greater risk of loss, including default, than higher quality debt securities. U.S. Government Obligations Risk. Obligations issued by US Government agencies and instrumentalities may receive varying levels of support from the government, which could affect the fund's ability to recover should they default. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise and vice versa. Portfolio Size Risk. The Fund typically will hold a small number of positions. To the extent that a significant portion of the Fund's total assets is invested in a limited number of holdings, the appreciation or depreciation of any one position may have a greater impact on the Fund's NAV than it would if the Fund held a greater number of constituents. Non-Diversified Fund Risk. The Fund is non-diversified and may experience greater volatility than a more diversified investment. ADR Risk. American Depository Receipts (ADRs) may be subject to certain of the risks associated with direct investments in the securities of foreign companies. ADRs may not track the price of the underlying securities on which they are based, and their value may change materially at times when U.S. markets are not open for trading. Issuer-Specific Changes Risk. The value of an individual security or particular type of security may be more volatile than the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of the market as a whole. Cash Transaction (JO:TCPJ) Risk. The Fund currently intends to effect creations and redemptions principally for cash, rather than principally in-kind because of the nature of the Fund's investments. As such, investments in the Fund may be less tax efficient than investments in ETFs that create and redeem in-kind. Market Trading Risk. The Fund is subject to numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market, losses from trading in secondary markets, and disruption in the creation/redemption process. During stressed market conditions, Shares may become less liquid as result of deteriorating liquidity which could lead to differences in the market price and the underlying value of those Shares. Tax Risk. To qualify as a regulated investment company ("RIC"), the Fund must meet a qualifying income test each taxable year. Failure to comply with the test would have significant negative tax consequences for shareholders. The Fund believes that income from futures should be treated as qualifying income for purposes of this test, thus qualifying the Fund as a RIC. If the IRS were to determine that the Fund's income is derived from the futures did not constitute qualifying income, the Fund likely would be required to reduce its exposure to such investments in order to maintain its RIC status. Before investing, investors should carefully read the prospectus/summary prospectus and carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.

NA3999500 11/24 Contact: Samantha Brandifino, samantha.brandifino@invesco.com, 332 323-5557 New offerings position Invesco as the provider with the most expansive set of ETF assets that access unique exposures of the groundbreaking companies within Nasdaq Indexes ATLANTA, Dec. 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Invesco Ltd . (NYSE: NYSE:IVZ), a leading global asset management firm, announced today the expansion of the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite to include Invesco Top QQQ ETF (QBIG) and Invesco QQQ Low Volatility ETF (QQLV). The newest additions to the firm's popular family of QQQ strategies further positions the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite as the most expansive set of ETFs, by assets under management (AUM)1, to offer unique and varied exposures to the innovative companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index ®. "We're excited that the longstanding partnership between Nasdaq and Invesco continues to result in the launch of unique, innovative ETFs, positioning Invesco as the leading provider of Nasdaq-100 ETFs1," says Brian Hartigan, Invesco's Global Head of ETFs & Index Investments. "QBIG and QQLV will offer investors additional ways to access to the Nasdaq Indexes that meet their desired investment outcomes. These ETFs further advance the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite as a 'one stop shop' for innovation that offers investors a range of differentiated ETFs." The ETFs offer different exposures to the Nasdaq-100 Index, giving investors an opportunity to either access high beta or low beta versions of the Nasdaq-100 Index and providing options for both potential greater upside capture or potential downside mitigation. The two strategies consider the ever-changing economic landscape by giving shareholders two unique exposures to forward-thinking companies within the Nasdaq-100 Index. QBIG is an actively managed ETF that uses a rules-based approach to track the Nasdaq-100 Mega™ Index ®, which captures the top 45% of companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index. Invesco believes this approach is the most effective way to gain targeted exposure to innovation through high growth, mega-cap companies. Focusing on the top 45%, rather than specific named companies or a specific number of companies such as the "Magnificent 72," or previously, "FANMAG3" and "FAANG4", allows QBIG to be prepared for any potential shifts that may occur in the mega-cap landscape. QBIG's methodology adjusts on a quarterly basis for the inevitable and continuously evolving fluctuations in the composition of the largest companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index over a longer time horizon. QQLV is the first ETF in the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite to offer exposure to low volatility companies in the Nasdaq-100 Index. The passively managed fund tracks the Nasdaq-100 Low Volatility™ Index ®, which identifies the least volatile companies over the trailing 12 months within the Nasdaq-100 Index, offering investors access to growth companies within the Nasdaq-100 Index determined to have lower volatility. "Invesco and Nasdaq have been breaking new ground together for years, and we are excited to partner on two new additions to the Invesco QQQ Innovation Suite," said Emily Spurling, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Index at Nasdaq. "For nearly 40 years, our flagship Nasdaq-100 Index has been the benchmark for innovation, and we are pleased Invesco can offer investors access to the concentrated companies in the Nasdaq-100 Mega Index and low volatility factor captured by the Nasdaq-100 Low Volatility Index." With the launch of QBIG and QQLV, investors now have a robust suite of ETFs that access different exposures and strategies of the Nasdaq Indexes. QQLV offers exposure to the Nasdaq-100 Index ® in a more conservative style, and could complement QBIG by offering an opportunity to invest in both ends of the Nasdaq-100 Index beta spectrum. QQLV also offers juxtaposition to the concentration risk of holding the largest mega-cap companies of the Nasdaq-100 Index.

Important Information: Invesco Distributors, Inc. is not affiliated with Nasdaq. Basis points, as known as bps, are a unit of measurement. One basis point is equivalent to 0.01% or 0.0001 in decimal form. The Nasdaq-100 Index ® is composed of the 100 largest domestic and international non-financial securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market ® based on market capitalization. The Nasdaq-100 Mega™ Index is designed to target the performance of approximately the Top 45% cumulative weight of the Nasdaq-100 Index ® (NDX ®). The Nasdaq-100 Low Volatility™ Index is designed to track the performance of the bottom quartile of the Nasdaq-100 Index ® (NDX ®) based on 12-month realized volatility. An investment cannot be made directly into an index. About Risk: There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Index-based ETFs are not actively managed. Actively managed ETFs do not necessarily seek to replicate the performance of a specified index. Both index-based and actively managed ETFs are subject to risks similar to stocks, including those related to short selling and margin maintenance. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. Investments focused in a particular sector, such as information technology, are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. In general, equity values fluctuate, sometimes widely, in response to activities specific to the company as well as general market, economic and political conditions. QQLV Investments focused in a particular sector are subject to greater risk and are more greatly impacted by market volatility than more diversified investments. There is no assurance that the Fund will provide low volatility. The Fund may become "non-diversified," as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, solely as a result of a change in relative market capitalization or index weighting of one or more constituents of the Index. Shareholder approval will not be sought when the Fund crosses from diversified to non-diversified status under such circumstances. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not utilize an investing strategy that seeks returns in excess of its Underlying Index. Therefore, the Fund would not necessarily buy or sell a security unless that security is added or removed, respectively, from its Underlying Index, even if that security generally is underperforming. QBIG Market Risk. Securities held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations. You should anticipate that the value of the Shares will decline, more or less, in correlation with any decline in value of the securities in the Fund's portfolio. Additionally, natural or environmental disasters, widespread disease or other public health issues, war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, economic crises or other events could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's net asset value ("NAV"). Management Risk. The Fund is subject to management risk because a portion of its assets are actively managed. In managing certain of the Fund's investment sleeves and other portfolio holdings, the Adviser applies investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment and asset allocation decisions for the Fund, but there can be no guarantee that these actions will produce the desired results. Index Risk. While a portion of the Fund's portfolio is actively managed, another portion of the Fund's portfolio is designed to track the performance of the Index. In managing this portion of the Fund's portfolio, the portfolio managers will not generally buy or sell a security unless that security is added or removed, respectively, from the Index, regardless of the performance of that security. If a specific security is removed from the Index, the Fund may be forced to sell such security at an inopportune time or for a price lower than the security's current market value. The Index may not contain the appropriate mix of securities for any particular economic cycle. Equity Risk. In general, equity values fluctuate, sometimes widely, in response to activities specific to the company as well as general market, economic and political conditions. Swap Agreements Risk. Swaps involve greater risks than direct investments. Swaps are subject to leveraging, liquidity and counterparty risks, and therefore may be difficult to value. Adverse changes in the value or level of the swap can result in gains or losses that are substantially greater than invested, with the potential for unlimited loss. Industry Concentration Risk. Investments focused in a particular industry are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. Technology Industry Risk. Investments focused in a particular sector, such as technology, are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives may be more volatile and less liquid than traditional investments and are subject to market, interest rate, credit, leverage, counterparty and management risks. An investment in a derivative could lose more than the cash amount invested. Futures Contracts Risk. Risks of futures contracts include: an imperfect correlation between the value of the futures contract and the underlying commodity; possible lack of a liquid secondary market; inability to close a futures contract when desired; losses due to unanticipated market movements; obligation for the Fund to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin; failure to close a position may result in the Fund receiving an illiquid commodity; and unfavorable execution prices. Counterparty Risk. Counterparty risk is the risk that the other party to the contract will not fulfill its contractual obligations, which may cause losses or additional costs. Leverage Risk. Leverage created from borrowing or certain types of transactions or instruments may impair the fund's liquidity, cause it to liquidate positions at an unfavorable time or lose more than it invested, increase volatility or otherwise not achieve its intended objective. Cash/Cash Equivalent Risk. To the extent the Fund holds cash or cash equivalents rather than securities or other instruments in which it primarily invests, the Fund risks losing opportunities to participate in market appreciation and may experience potentially lower returns. Collateral Securities Risk. Collateral may include obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies and instrumentalities, including bills, notes and bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury, money market funds and corporate debt securities, such as commercial paper. Although the Fund may hold securities that carry U.S. government guarantees, these guarantees do not extend to shares of the Fund. Money market funds are subject to management fees and other expenses. Therefore, investments in money market funds will cause the Fund to bear indirectly a proportional share of the fees and costs of the money market funds in which it invests.

ADRs may not track the price of the underlying securities on which they are based, and their value may change materially at times when U.S. markets are not open for trading. Issuer-Specific Changes Risk. The value of an individual security or particular type of security may be more volatile than the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of the market as a whole. Cash Transaction (JO:TCPJ) Risk. The Fund currently intends to effect creations and redemptions principally for cash, rather than principally in-kind because of the nature of the Fund's investments. As such, investments in the Fund may be less tax efficient than investments in ETFs that create and redeem in-kind. Market Trading Risk. The Fund is subject to numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market, losses from trading in secondary markets, and disruption in the creation/redemption process. During stressed market conditions, Shares may become less liquid as result of deteriorating liquidity which could lead to differences in the market price and the underlying value of those Shares. Tax Risk. To qualify as a regulated investment company ("RIC"), the Fund must meet a qualifying income test each taxable year. Failure to comply with the test would have significant negative tax consequences for shareholders. The Fund believes that income from futures should be treated as qualifying income for purposes of this test, thus qualifying the Fund as a RIC. If the IRS were to determine that the Fund's income is derived from the futures did not constitute qualifying income, the Fund likely would be required to reduce its exposure to such investments in order to maintain its RIC status.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Revel is adding to its electric vehicle charging empire in New York City. The startup said on Wednesday that it has broken ground on the installation of 24 EV fast chargers at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The installation doubles the airport’s existing EV charging capacity. This is the second time Revel has partnered with New York’s Port Authority, which acts as the landlord and regulator for the city’s ports, to install fast chargers. The two are also building out 48 fast charging ports near LaGuardia Airport. Both airport projects are expected to be completed in 2025. Revel and the NY Port Authority plan to place the chargers — which will support both the Combined Charging System and the North American Charging Standard — at JFK Airport’s west cell phone lot, which is where drivers, including Revel’s ride-hail drivers, often wait for passengers to arrive. The ports promise to charge an EV from 20% to 80% within 15 to 20 minutes. Revel, which began as an e-moped sharing service before launching an all-electric ride-hail platform and building NY’s first EV charging hub, currently runs four public 24/7 fast-charging stations. These feature a total of 64 ports in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, and the company plans to add five more across the city, including the two at the JFK and LaGuardia airports. The startup’s playbook has been to roll out ride-hail services alongside charging stations so that the chargers see maximum utilization. Revel says its stations are used roughly 50/50 by its ride-hail drivers and by other EV owners. A Revel spokesperson told TechCrunch that the majority of those EV owners are ride-hail drivers for competing platforms — the company gives Uber drivers a 25% discount at its sites as part of a partnership with the ride-hail and delivery giant. In October, Toyota and Revel agreed to give Toyota and Lexus EV owners free access to Revel’s charging stations. “It’s impossible to electrify rideshare without an abundance of charging near airports,” Frank Reig, co-founder and CEO of Revel, said in a statement. “Revel’s JFK site will be one of the most used fast charging stations in the country, and with the Port Authority’s support, we’re on track to open it in a matter of months.” Revel launched its ride-hail platform in 2021, featuring an all-Tesla fleet driven by its own employees. But this September, the company laid off its employee drivers and implemented a gig-work system, where it rents out its cars to the workers. Today, its fleet of 550 cars includes other EVs, like the Kia Niro. Revel is funding the installation of the charging ports at JFK Airport. The startup has raised roughly $275 million to date, per PitchBook, from investors including BlackRock, Toyota Ventures, and Maniv, and is currently raising more capital to fund its expansion, according to the company. Outside of New York, Revel recently broke ground at a charging station in downtown San Francisco (it plans to open the station in the first quarter of 2025), and has plans to open a site in Los Angeles in 2026. A spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch Revel has eight active leases for sites across the Bay Area, is actively acquiring other sites, and plans to open more than 100 charge ports in the region in the coming years.

Zepbound is the “superior” choice for people looking to shed a few pounds, at least compared to Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-0.12%) Wegovy, according to Eli Lilly (LLY-0.48%). On Wednesday, the Indiana-based pharmaceutical firm released the topline results of a head-to-head clinical trial that it funded, which Lilly says is the first randomized, controlled clinical trial that compares the two weight loss drugs. According to Lilly, which sells both Zepbound and Mounjaro, patients who received weekly shots of Zepbound lost an average of 20.2% of their body weight, or 50 pounds, after 72 weeks. Patients who took shots of Wegovy each week lost an average of 13.7% of their body weight during that period. More than 31% of the people taking Zepbound reported at least 25% body weight loss, compared to just 16.1% of the patients who took Wegovy. Overall, Lilly said, Zepbound provided 47% more weight loss than Wegovy. “We are thrilled that today’s findings showed the superior weight loss of Zepbound, which helped patients achieve 47% more relative weight loss compared to Wegovy,” Leonard C. Glass, senior vice president of global medical affairs at Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, said in a statement. The trial results were based on tests of a randomized sample of 751 adults across the U.S., including Puerto Rico, who received the maximum tolerated dose of each drug. Each of the participants was either overweight or obese. The most commonly reported side effects were gastrointestinal-related. The topline results were announced in a press release and haven’t yet been made available for peer review. Lilly said it will continue to evaluate its results before publishing them in a peer-reviewed journal and presenting them at a medical meeting in 2025. Although past studies have demonstrated that Zepbound performed better than Wegovy, Lilly’s trial is the first to compare them side-by-side rather than relying on previously published data. It may lead to greater demand for Zepbound, which was first added to the Food and Drug Administration’s drug shortage list back in April. Both Zepbound and Mounjaro were taken off that list in October. The rise of GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, has been a major booster for Lilly and Novo Nordisk, making them the most valuable pharma companies in the world. A number of cheaper, off-brand versions have also made it to market as demand remains high for ways to lose weight.

Title: Predicting proprioceptive cortical anatomy and neural coding with topographic autoencoders

Proprioception is one of the least understood senses, yet fundamental for the control of movement. Even basic questions of how limb pose is represented in the somatosensory cortex are unclear. We developed a topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topo-VAE) to compute a putative cortical map from a large set of natural movement data. Although not fitted to neural data, our model reproduces two sets of observations from monkey centre-out reaching: 1. The shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive receptive fields in hand-centered coordinates despite the model having no knowledge of arm kinematics or hand coordinate systems. 2. The distribution of neuronal preferred directions (PDs) recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model makes several testable predictions: 1. Encoding across the cortex has a blob-and-pinwheel-type geometry of PDs. 2. Few neurons will encode just a single joint. Our model provides a principled basis for understanding of sensorimotor representations, and the theoretical basis of neural manifolds, with applications to the restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and the control of humanoid robots. It is well established that proprioception is essential for effective for motor control, yet our understanding of proprioceptive coding in somatosensory cortex lags behind that of more studied sensory modalities such as vision and touch. Here, we use unsupervised learning of a deep neural network imposed with biological constraints to reproduce coding properties of proprioceptive neurons in area 2 of primary somatosensory cortex. With this model, we demonstrate that the tendency for area 2 neurons in close physical proximity to share similar directional tuning can be explained by local topographic organisation driven by Mexican hat lateral effects, a phenomenon that is otherwise unobservable with the spatial resolution of available electrode microarray recordings. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence of local topographic organisation in area 2 proprioceptive neurons. We also predict that the structure of proprioceptive receptive fields is typically multi-joint rather than single-joint in nature and provides, to the best of our knowledge. We find that our model best reproduces the tuning properties of neural data when training on natural kinematic recordings, rather than those from a stereotyped task, underlining the importance of training on data that reflect the natural distribution of sensory stimuli.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Somatosensation includes the familiar sense of touch, provided by receptors in the skin, and proprioception, the much less consciously perceived sense that informs us about the pose, motion and associated forces acting on our limbs. Both are essential for our ability to plan, control and adapt movements. In engineering, the control of robotic movement would be impossible if the controller did not know the location of its actuators; correspondingly in human motor control, popular frameworks for explaining many types of movement, such as optimal feedback control theory [1,2], are dependent on feedback such as that provided by proprioception. Moreover, individuals with proprioceptive neurological deficits, such as patient IW, have profound motor deficits even in the presence of vision and an intact motor system [3,4]. Similarly, recent major developments in the control of limb movement through intracortical Brain Computer Interfaces are centred on restoring somatosensory sensory feedback as well as effecting motion [5–8]. Thus far, these efforts have been almost exclusively limited to the sense of touch, in part because of our better understanding of that modality. However, restored proprioceptive feedback is also likely to be needed to adequately restore functional capability [9–11]. Unlike hearing or vision, proprioceptive afferent pathways originate not from a single organ but from diverse families of mechanoreceptors within muscles, tendons, joints, and even the skin [12]. Proprioceptive information ascends within the dorsal column pathway through the dorsal root ganglia, the dorsal column nuclei, and thalamus before arriving in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Crucially, neurons are somatotopically organised throughout this pathway, meaning that neighbouring neurons encode stimuli from closely related parts of the body. This gives rise to the sensory homunculus, which results from the ordered mapping of tactile representations of the body’s surface across the cortical surface [13]. Although proprioception is generally acknowledged to be critical to motor behaviour, the corresponding proprioceptive maps ‐ particularly that of primate area 3a, but also the mixed modality area 2 ‐ are much less obviously structured than those of the touch (areas 1 and 3b). We know that the proprioceptive and tactile systems often encode overlapping information, e.g. mechanoreceptors in our skin and interosseous membranes respond to deformation and vibration, contributing to the sense of body position and movement [3]. Indeed, the firing rates of somatosensory neurons with cutaneous receptive fields in area 2 can be used to decode limb movement as accurately as those with muscle fields [14]. While proprioceptive cortical areas are critical for our ability to generate goal-directed complex behaviour it is unclear what properties of proprioceptive cortical coding facilitate this capability. Crucially, we lack an accepted hypothesis about the computational principles that drive the mapping of proprioceptive arm representations onto the cortex. The limited nature of our understanding of proprioceptive neural representations in the brain is in large part due to the difficulty of delivering independent proprioceptive stimuli in comparison to other senses, such as vision [15] and touch [16]. To overcome this limitation, we combined computational modelling and natural movement kinematic data to test hypotheses of organisational mechanisms that are currently beyond the capability of microarray recording techniques, where the distance between electrodes is too great to observe spatial organisation at the level of neighbouring neurons. This combination of experiment and theory has been useful for explaining population-level coding in other sensory modalities, such as vision [17] and touch [18,19], but has only recently begun to be applied to proprioception [20,21]. Much of the computational theoretical work on other senses has either focused on predicting specific neural coding features from natural sensory statistics [18,22], or has ignored the details of neural coding and focused on the spatial distribution of stimulus representation across the cortex [23]. Our chosen system was the proprioception of the right arm (Fig 1A) for which we had collected natural behavioural data from daily life in humans (food preparation, eating, etc; Figs 1B and S1) as well as constrained, planar centre-out reaching in both humans and monkeys (Fig 1C). This data describes the joint angle kinematics of the of the body over time and thus stands in for the proprioceptive sensory state. We aimed to relate kinematics to proprioceptive encoding with modelling and comparisons to existing single-unit recordings from monkeys. We formulated a novel computational model that predicts both neural coding of single neurons and the spatial organisation of these neurons across the cortex (Fig 1D–1G). We chose a small set of general computational elements that reflect principles and mechanisms found in sensory systems but have not been previously unified, which are as follows: Models should 1) use the information maximisation principle, which postulates that efficient sensory representations in the brain reflect natural sensory statistics, and implies that they are essential in shaping neural representations, 2) be stochastic, generative, and decodable, to reflect the natural variability in the data, produce neural activity to mimic that of the biological system, and offer the means to reconstruct the relevant original sensory input from its output, 3) implement, in Marr’s sense [24], neural computations that are performed by locally interacting neurons through synaptic interactions, rather than by an abstract computational machine.

(H) Flow of natural and planar movement data (joint angular velocities) in this work. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012614.g001 In the context of proprioception, these principles require that our model should learn how to translate proprioceptive inputs from movements of the body into a latent representation of proprioception (which is read out as neural firing). In addition to performing efficient feature learning of a spike-based code, the model should have minimal inductive bias regarding a particular sensory modality, in that it can be generalised to modelling other regions of sensory cortex. By training the model on natural movement stimuli, it should learn representations that can maximise information about the environment with the limited bandwidth of neurons that is available at any given encoding step, thereby implementing efficient coding [25–27]. Given these requirements, we chose to use an unsupervised deep neural network model, a variational autoencoder (VAE) [28] (Fig 1D) to perform efficient feature learning of proprioceptive stimuli. The primary training objective of an autoencoder is to reconstruct the input stimuli, enabling the model to learn in an unsupervised manner. Furthermore, in our use case, the encoder component of the VAE model parameterises a latent Bernoulli distribution to imitate the activity of spiking neurons. In following our third outlined principle and the observation that spatial organization is relevant to cortical coding, we introduce a 2-dimensional structure to the latent (“bottleneck”) layer of the VAE (Fig 1E). A conventional “vanilla” VAE model will capture the properties of encoded sensory features but would be devoid of any of the spatial properties of cortical neurons that are critical for determining how sensory stimuli are represented across the cortical surface. Incorporating spatial relationships in neural coding models has proven an important consideration for understanding neural computation, where anatomical structure and function in neural computation are fundamentally linked by biophysical constraints [30–33]. We therefore also implemented a topographical mechanism, using a lateral interaction term between the units in the VAE’s latent layer (see Methods for detailed motivation and mathematical description; Fig 1F). This term corresponds biologically to a spatial distribution of short-range excitatory and longer-range inhibitory synaptic interactions between neurons (Fig 1G). We call our model the “topo-VAE” and compared it with existing recordings from area 2 of somatosensory cortex. It could equally well be applied to other proprioceptive areas such as 3a or even 5. With further adjustments, such as replacing the linear decoder (or even the MLP encoder) layer with more elaborate architectures, it should be possible to apply this model to the study of spatial organisation in other sensory modalities, including touch, vision, and hearing. Here, the approach has enabled us to uncover novel insights into proprioceptive coding by linking anatomical structure and function so that we can test our model’s predictions using the sparse set of obtainable data. We developed a novel model of cortical sensory representation (see Methods for details) that predicts both function and structure–the topo-VAE model. We trained, and validated, and tested our model as follows (Fig 1H): We trained our topo-VAE model on natural daily human arm movement kinematics and explored the emergent proprioceptive representations in its cortical layer (i.e. the latent layer of the topo-VAE). After training, we used the model to generate neural responses by providing it kinematic data from a centre-out reaching task performed by human subjects. We then compared the properties of these simulated neural activities (i.e. the generated spike trains) to those of S1 neurons which were previously recorded from monkeys performing a planar centre-out reaching task, for which macaque and human arm kinematics are known to be similar [34]. We characterised the proprioceptive neural representations at two levels of description: first, we considered the spatial tuning curves of individual neurons and second, we considered the organisation of tuning preference maps across our model’s cortical surface. We used three sets of measurements to summarise the neural coding properties of S1 neurons for this centre-out task: 1) the preferred direction (PD) of single-neuron firing rates, 2) features of the tuning surface defined by firing rate modulation as a function of both direction and speed of movement, and 3) the overall distribution of firing rates throughout the behaviour. First, we analysed PDs of neurons in the recordings and in our modelling (Fig 2). The PD refers to the movement direction of the hand (when performing the centre-out reaching task) in which a neuron was most active. The tuning surface refers to the inferred firing rate response of a neuron to a given range of endpoint directions and velocities, which is generated using a Poisson GLM trained to map from x and y endpoint velocities to the firing rate of a neuron. We found that generally, the parametrically fit PD tuning surfaces exhibited by modelled neurons were similar in appearance to those of recorded neurons (cf. Fig 2A and 2B, top panel for the 12 best matches between modelled and recorded neurons, bottom panel for 12 examples from the ∼50th percentile of match quality. Further examples of each can be found in S2 Fig). At the population level, while there was a statistically significant difference (p<0.005; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) between the distribution of PDs of modelled and recorded neurons (Fig 2C), the distributions were similar in that they were both bimodal (S3 Fig), with a bias towards the 120°/300° reach axis (Mean: 97° vs 115°, natural-trained model vs recorded) (Fig 2D). Previous experimental studies have suggested such coding biases are a natural consequence of musculoskeletal constraints in the arm [35,36], which cause the natural distribution of right arm reach movements to favour the 120°/300° reach axis. Under the efficient coding hypothesis, this becomes reflected in the coding properties of the sensory neurons. To test this theory, we trained a second model on stereotyped movement stimuli from the centre-out reach task only. We compared the reconstruction quality (R2 scores) of natural-trained and planar-trained models by evaluating them on planar and natural movement data, respectively. We found that the natural-trained model generalised to planar movement data significantly better than the planar-trained model generalised to natural movement data (0.81 ±0.02 vs 0.73 ±0.04, natural-trained vs planar-trained; p<0.005; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The planar-trained model produced a PD distribution that was also significantly different from the PD distribution of recorded neurons (p<0.005; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), but unlike the natural-trained model, the reach axis bias was perpendicular to that of recorded neurons (Mean: 49° vs 115°, planar-trained modelled vs recorded) (Fig 2D and 2E). This suggests that certain features of proprioceptive coding are only emergent when the coding is conditioned on the natural distribution of stimuli.

Two such features were compared (Fig 3A): Half-peak widths measure how sharp the tuning of a neuron is, where smaller half-peak widths indicate sharper tuning, and velocity gradients measure how sharply the firing rate of a neuron changes as a function of the endpoint velocity in the direction of tuning (note that the velocity gradient measurements were adjusted to control for differences in mean firing rate between modelled and recorded neurons). While there was a statistically significant difference between the feature distributions of modelled and recorded neurons (p<0.005 for both features and all model variations; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), Jensen-Shannon divergence between distributions was minimised (Fig 3B and 3C) when the model included lateral effects and was trained on natural movement data. This would suggest that both model constraints are important for reproducing the tuning properties of recorded neurons. One concern was that the distributions of tuning curve geometry between modelled and recorded neuron populations were similar only because of the Poisson GLM fitting process–perhaps fitting a Poisson GLM to any random data would produce distributions like these. To verify that this was not the case, we shuffled the firing rate data from modelled neurons to remove any correlation between endpoint velocities and firing rates and trained an additional Poisson GLM on this data. The shuffling produced a very different pair of distributions for the geometric features, with flat, poorly tuned curves–suggesting that any similarities we saw between the original unshuffled curves were in fact due to similarities in the underlying structure of the modelled and recorded neuron data. This provides an empirical lower bound of the similarity between feature distributions, and would suggest that similarity between the distributions of modelled and recorded neurons is not trivially the result of using a GLM (Fig 3B and 3C).

We compared the distributions at different endpoint velocities and found that they differed significantly in both modelled and recorded neurons (p<0.005; two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test), indicating velocity dependence in both. In summary, modelled neurons in the topo-VAE exhibit various tuning properties such as preferred direction and endpoint-velocity modulation of firing rates which are structurally similar to those of recorded neurons. While the population statistics of these tuning properties differ significantly between modelled recorded neurons, the combined lateral effects that constrain our model and the training data that reflects the natural distribution of arm movement, increase the similarity, all without fitting our model to any neural data. Having demonstrated similarity in the tuning statistics between modelled and recorded neurons, we next compared the spatial relationship of PDs in our model neurons to those in the monkey brain within the constraints of the 400 μm spacing of the recording electrodes (Fig 4). While neurons recorded at two adjacent electrodes corresponded to a distance that was substantially beyond the effective range of the Mexican hat distance function, many electrodes recorded data from more than one distinguishable neuron. The distance between these neurons was within the local neighbourhood of neurons in our model. We could thus compare the similarity of neural coding properties (specifically, the PDs) between neurons recorded on the same electrode to the similarity between neurons on different electrodes (cf. Fig 4A). In modelled neurons, same-electrode PD differences followed an exponential distribution, such that the probability that two neurons had similar (within 30 degrees) PDs was much higher than chance (p = 0.81; Fig 4C., blue histogram). Conversely, the probability that two neurons on the same electrode had nearly opposite PDs (between 150° and 180°) was very low (p = 0.032; Fig 4C orange histogram). These distributions were significantly different for nearby vs distant neurons (p<0.05; two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test). We then ran the same analysis on recorded neurons (Fig 4C) and found that there was no significant difference between the nearby PD difference distributions (orange) in modelled vs recorded neurons when σ = 2 (p > 0.05; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Different choices of the neighbourhood hyperparameter, σ, led to differences in the exponential distributions of PD difference (S4B and S4C Fig). Small neighbourhood values (σ = 1, S4B and S4C Fig, left) led to more uniform distributions, whereas larger neighbourhood values (σ = 3, S4B and S4C Fig, right) led to a more exponential distribution, both of which were significantly different from the distributions observed in recorded neurons (p < 0.05; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). This would suggest that a lateral effect range of σ = 2 most accurately captures lateral interaction distances in proprioceptive cortex.

The model predicts that PDs are clustered in blob-like structures of similar PDs with boundary regions where the PDs rotate smoothly toward neighbouring directions (Fig 4D). This arrangement is interrupted by small, sparsely spaced “pinwheel” regions, representing all PDs in a small neighbourhood, which is consistent with same-electrode similarity of Fig 4B and 4C. Next, we examined which specific elements of the lateral interaction were important for reproducing the recorded data. We verified through model ablation the importance of the shape of the Mexican hat function (blue curve in Fig 5A), which determines the strength of excitatory and inhibitory connections as a function of distance between two neurons. We found no lateral effect function with a significant effect on input data reconstruction accuracy when compared to a model with no lateral effects (P<0.005; ANOVA). Flipping the function upside down (i.e., short range inhibition and intermediate range excitation, yellow curve in Fig 5A) eliminated the obvious topographic structure (Fig 5B, yellow box). Similarly, removing either the excitatory (purple curve in Fig 5A) or inhibitory component (red curve in Fig 5A) produced results unlike the localised topographic structure of our primary model against which the recorded data was validated (Fig 5B, purple and red boxes, respectively), suggesting that the specific Mexican hat shape was important for reproducing biological results.

(B) resulting PD maps for each function (colour matched to 5D). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012614.g005 We also investigate whether this topographic organisation emerges when the model is trained on shuffled kinematic data, to determine if the inherent structure of movement data (e.g. the covariance between joints and the constraints due to musculoskeletal geometry) contributes to the topographic organisation. We find that, while some level of organisation remains (S5A Fig), it is less pronounced (S5B Fig), suggesting that the structure of natural movement shapes topographic organisation in conjunction with lateral effects. In addition to predicting the spatial organisation of proprioceptive coding, our model enables testable predictions about the representation of movements involving multiple joints (wrist, elbow, shoulder) across the neural population. To obtain a measure of how the 3 joints (Fig 6A) are encoded across the cortical surface relative to each other, we found the average correlation with firing rate for all the degrees of freedom of each joint. All joints were evenly represented across the whole population (Fig 6B), but no neurons correlated with only one joint. Many modelled neurons were correlated even with non-adjacent joints, e.g. elbow-wrist or even all three joints, possibly a result of the natural covariance patterns that exist between joints. For pairwise joint sensitivity comparisons see scatter plots (S6 Fig). (A) Joint angle axes, 3 per joint. (B) 3D plot showing the relative sensitivity of each neuron to joint inputs.

The maps had a spatial pattern of ripple-like transitions between positive (white) and negative (black) correlations (Fig 6C), producing topographic clusters of neurons that are sensitive to particular joints (Fig 6D). The scale of these clusters approximately matched the that of the Mexican-hat lateral connection range. Regions of pure red, green, or blue in Fig 6D would correspond to neurons responsive to only shoulder, elbow, or wrist respectively. Instead, colours that are the result of blending two or more joints predominate. Here, we combine natural proprioceptive stimuli with a novel model of neural coding and topographical organization of neurons in somatosensory cortex to help develop our understanding of proprioceptive coding and allowing us to paint a picture beyond that we can see through the restricted lens of neural recordings. Core to our approach was allowing the model to learn to represent the statistics of natural human movements rather than stereotyped movements, which under the efficient coding hypothesis is key to understanding sensory representations in the nervous system [27,37–39]. Our topo-VAE is designed to reflect information processing in cortex: we hypothesise that the cortex learns, through experience, an efficient representation of the somatosensory world which we replicate here as a deep autoencoder network. The network learns a nonlinear mapping from kinematic inputs into a “cortical” latent space of spiking neurons, which embodies a stochastic, generative model of movement-related neural activity. While VAEs have been used before to learn both single neuron and population level features from spike train data [40,41] a vanilla VAE cannot induce a topographic mapping on the data. Consequently, they cause nearby input variables (stimuli) to be represented in arbitrary locations across the latent space. By contrast, the latent space of a topo-VAE is arranged as a two-dimensional cortical surface, thereby creating a population of neurons on a square grid. This enables a lateral interaction term between neighbouring neurons to be added, that shapes cortical activity into local neighbourhoods, allowing it to learn cortical-like spatial structure as well as temporal single-neuron activity patterns, both of which we compare to recorded neural data. Previous self-organising maps [23,42,43] operate on less biologically plausible grounds. For example, Kohonen-type maps operate on winner-takes-all, non-spiking activation (and consequently, their training updates synaptic connections in a winner-takes-all form as well) [43]. Therefore, only one neuron can ever be active for given a sensory stimulus in a Kohonen map, a property very unlike actual proprioceptive cortex. In contrast, any number of neurons in our topo-VAE can be active simultaneously (and consequently, all synaptic connections are updated as sensory information is processed). Likewise, Poisson GLMs consider only the input statistics when producing simulated neural responses. While it is possible to reproduce the coding properties of individual neurons from convergence of peripheral inputs to a GLM, those models can tell us little about the role of neighbouring cells in shaping receptive fields or neuroanatomy-neural function relationships in general. It is important to note that there would be alternative ways to introduce lateral effects in the latent space which might better reflect biological circuits than the loss term used here. For example, our current approach simply encourages nearby neurons to be active when driven by similar inputs, and distant neurons to be active for differing inputs. However, lateral effects in biological circuits involve causal excitatory and inhibitory interactions between neurons. Such interactions may be better modelled in a network with recurrent feedback, which would also enable the latent space to be conditioned on sequences of stimuli. Alternatively, conditional random fields [44,45] could capture this property without the need for recurrent feedback, by conditioning the probability of a neuron firing on both the input, and the state of neighbouring neurons (defined by an undirected graph similar to Ψ). Emergent from our model, were neurons with tuning surfaces comparable to those of recorded neurons as monkeys performed the same centre-out task (Fig 2A and 2B). Furthermore, higher-level features of the modelled neurons, such as PD distributions and the distributions of tuning curve features, were comparable to recorded neurons, particularly when the model was constrained by lateral effects and trained on stimuli that reflected the natural distributions of arm movement (Figs 2 and 3). However, they were not captured perfectly (e.g. the PD and tuning geometry distributions of modelled neurons were still significantly different from those of recorded neurons, p<0.005; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Despite this, the current model is able provide multiple predictions about the nature of proprioceptive coding, one of which we partially validate with our limited neural data. Future work includes identifying additional constraints that can allow the model to better reproduce neural data from proprioceptive cortex. The well-known somatosensory homunculus represents only the tactile component of somatosensation and its well-ordered map of the skin receptors. Since the human tactile homunculus has driven much of neuroscience’s intuition about somatosensory representations, it is tempting to hypothesise that proprioceptive representations might also be similarly structured. However, proprioception is driven not by receptors embedded in a “simple” two-dimensional sheet, but rather by different types of muscle receptors with varying dynamics, that span one, two, and even three joints. Thus, the expectation that proprioception and touch might share a similar homunculus may not be reasonable. Indeed, instead of a point-to-point mapping to the limb, in our model, we find structure akin to the pinwheels of the visual cortex, here representing hand movement direction instead of orientation selectivity. While the relatively large spacing of electrodes used to record neural data from area 2 does not allow us to confirm the pinwheel anatomical structure directly, there are signatures of it in the recordings, such as the fact that neurons recorded on a given electrode tend to have more similar PDs than those recorded on separate electrodes–a necessary, but not sufficient property for proprioceptive pinwheels. Our model predicts not only the spatial organisation of tuning, but also the receptive fields of single neurons–although this prediction remains difficult to test with our currently available data. We find that modelled neurons encode combinations of joints, both adjacent (shoulder-elbow) and distant (shoulder-wrist). Such convergence in monkey somatosensory cortex has been observed for the hand [46,47] and must be present to some extent in the proximal arm, given its multi-articular muscles. Our model used only joint-based inputs (i.e., the kinematic state or pose of the arm) but knows nothing about the musculoskeletal mechanics of the limb (e.g., the fact that bi-articulate muscles span multiple joints), beyond what can be inferred from correlations between joint angles. Nonetheless, multi-joint coding emerged for most neurons in our model. The correlations between motion of different joints that we observe in the natural data are substantial (4 principal components explain 80% of the variance of the seven degrees of freedom of the arm) and are the result of three main factors: 1) the biomechanics of the body, including the way many muscles span multiple joints, 2) the way the brain controls movements and 3) the tasks performed. Arguably, task requirements drive a substantial amount of the correlations. By training the topo-VAE on a highly varied dataset of natural movement, we enable it to generalise from these natural tasks to planar centre-out movements. Using this same dataset, Ejaz and colleagues showed that the pairwise similarity of finger-specific fMRI activity patterns in human sensorimotor cortex was better explained by the correlation structure of hand movements than muscle activity [37]. Therefore, the emergence of multi-joint proprioceptive receptive fields may be a further example of the shaping of neural activity by higher-order features of movements [48], analogous to higher-order features of visual receptive fields, such as edges in V1 [22]. It is important to acknowledge that while the comparisons between modelled and recorded neurons are promising, it is largely a qualitative similarity, particularly at the level of population statistics. Understanding what further constraints might enable our model to better reproduce these features will be an important step in further elucidating the principles that shape proprioceptive representations in the brain. We also make the key assumption that the proprioceptive organizational principles captured by our topo-VAE model based on the kinematics of human movement would extend to monkeys. While this assumption seems to have largely held, there may still exist differences that contribute to the inconsistencies between our model and recorded neurons. This may be addressed in future work using musculoskeletal models [49,50] to identify upper limb kinematics that are inconsistent between macaques and humans and filter them from the training data. Another key limitation of the current model is the use of only joint kinematics. Biological inputs to proprioceptive cortex are received from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, which convey muscle length, velocity, and force information. An important future direction will be to test the topo-VAE on such inputs, whether they be recorded experimentally or inferred from existing kinematic data using musculoskeletal simulations. Furthermore, because of its accessibility with Utah multielectrode arrays, we compared our modelled neurons to those recorded in area 2 of the somatosensory cortex, an area that combines cutaneous and muscle information in single neurons. Area 3a, on the other hand, has only muscle-receptor inputs, and shares many features with the adjacent motor cortex. One might expect an even closer correspondence between our model and area 3. Lastly, we would like to highlight the observation that, when trained on the stereotyped centre-out-data only, the topo-VAE predicted recorded neuron data more poorly than when it was trained on the richer natural movement data. We interpret this to reflect the efficient coding hypothesis [26], whereby a population of sensory neurons are optimised to code stimuli representative of those found in their natural environment. Such codes are well documented in the visual [22] and auditory systems [51]–here we provide evidence that this may also be the case for proprioceptive neurons. This points towards the importance of working with training data that matches the natural distribution of stimuli when modelling sensory neurons, as it suggests important features of the neural code (such as the complex receptive fields predicted by our model) will only be elucidated under these conditions. This observation may be of great importance for the many proprioceptive and motor neurophysiology experiments that have been conducted in highly constrained lab settings, settings that may not contain adequate ethologically relevant kinematic statistics to uncover the true coding of cortical neurons. Undertaking electrophysiological experiments with a broader repertoire of movements may affect proprioceptive neuroscience as much as the adoption of natural images did for understanding vision. All surgical and experimental procedures were fully consistent with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of Northwestern University under protocol number IS00000367. All human participants provided written consent, and experiments were approved by Imperial College Research Ethics Committee under Reference No. 18IC3815. In the following we lay out the rationale for building our model and the model itself, the various forms of data we collected for model training and validation, and the validation methodology. The topo-VAE model (cf. Fig 1D–1G) uses the autoencoder framework to model sensory representations. Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient encodings of unlabelled data [52]. We choose a variational autoencoder (VAE) [28] because we want the latent cortical layer to capture the stochasticity and variability inherent to neural representations [53]. Let be a set of N sensory stimuli consisting of D features, following the natural behaviour distribution p(X). A group of cortical neurons, arranged in a 2D grid, are activated by the sensory stimuli X and generate firing patterns . This relationship is captured by the conditional distribution p(Z│X), which is dependent on p(X), and therefore intractable. However, it is possible to approximate p(Z│X) through variational inference by optimising a more tractable distribution, q(Z), to minimise the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which can be derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence between q(Z) and p(Z│X): (1) By maximising the ELBO, we avoid having to compute p(X) while still guaranteeing that the DKL[q(Z)││p(Z│X)] is minimised, since: (2) where log p(x) is a fixed quantity for a given X. In the case of a VAE, P(Z│X) is approximated by an encoder network qθ(Z│X) and P(Z│X) by a decoder network pϕ(X│Z), where θ and ϕ represent the trainable parameters of the encoder and the decoder, respectively. For a given data sample xn the network is optimised according to the loss function: (3) Where is the negative log-likelihood of the nth data sample (the reconstruction loss), and DKL[qθ(z│xn)│p(z)] is a regularisation term that pushes qθ(z│xn) towards some prior distribution (which can also be thought of as enforcing an expected firing rate on the neurons in the latent space). In a conventional VAE the encoder network parameterises a Gaussian latent distribution. However, we choose to have the encoder network parameterise a Bernoulli latent distribution, such that zn is sampled from a distribution of {0,1}, thus constraining the model to a spike-based encoding scheme (which allows modelled neurons to be analysed with the same methods as those used for the recorded neural data.). This sampling step is made differentiable (enabling gradient estimation of network parameters) using the Gumbel-softmax trick [54]: (4) where τ is the softmax temperature, which causes zn to become one-hot as τ approaches 0 (a value of 0.1 is used for this work), gi is a random sample from the Gumbel distribution G(0,1), defined by the probability density function: (5) and π = [p 1-p] is a vector defining the probability of a neuron spiking vs. not spiking, where p is set by the output of the encoder network for each neuron. For the Bernoulli prior, values closer to 0.5 enforce greater noise in the spiking activity of latent neurons. We choose a Bernoulli prior of p(Z = 1│X) = 0.01, which was found to enforce sparse activity in the latent space without decreasing reconstruction quality (S7 Fig, top panel). In a conventional VAE, latent neurons lack the spatial relationships that constrain neural codes in cortex. Given this, we add a simple organisational mechanism that links learning of neighbouring latent neurons, effectively implementing cortical lateral connectivity with short range excitation and longer-range inhibition, by adding an additional term to the loss function of the VAE (Eq 3). This term is constructed by first assigning a unique 2D position to each neuron in the latent space, defined by , which arranges neurons in an M × M topographic map. We then define a function, ψ, to specify the desired activity relationship between neurons. The Mexican-hat function, which transitions with distance from excitation to inhibition before vanishing [55] is a natural choice for cortical neurons (Fig 1F and 1G). For two neurons with indices, p,q ∈[1,M], the function ψ(p,q) returns the desired lateral effect between these neurons: (6) where d(ωp,ωq)2 represents the Euclidean distance between neurons with indices p and q in the cortical grid: (7) and σ is a hyperparameter defining the common length scale of local excitation and intermediate-range inhibition. As shown in Fig 1G, the transition from maximum excitation to maximum inhibition spans a distance of 2σ and the lateral effect vanishes at about 4σ. This term forms the basis of the topography in the topo-VAE, enabling it to learn both receptive field tuning properties (in an unsupervised manner through deep feature learning) and establishes a topographic relationship between neurons. To compare our modelling and recording results, we chose hyperparameters of the topographic map with consideration of 1) spatial densities of S1 neurons and 2) characteristics of the neural recording devices. The density of neurons in S1 is about 8M – 17M per cm3 [56,57] of which 70% to 90% are pyramidal cells [58]. The thickness of cortex varies from 1 mm to 4.5 mm [59,60]. The Utah electrode array has 100 microelectrodes arranged in a 10 x 10 configuration with 400 μm separation along each axis, thus spanning 3.6 mm x 3.6 mm of the cortex. We model neuronal anatomy as voxels or cubes, where the number of pyramidal cells contained within 1mm3 of cortex varies from 12,000 to 100,000, which means every 1 mm along the cortical surface crosses about 20–50 pyramidal cells (see Fig 1C). The electrode array therefore captures a grid of approximately 80 x 80 neurons (for an evaluation of how decreasing this grid size affects the reconstruction score of the learned encoding, see S8 Fig). This means the range of the lateral effect parameter σ translates to a 1–2 neuron spacing on our cortical model grid (assuming the radius of dendritic input to these cortical neurons of around 200 μm [61]). The precise value of σ was determined post-hoc using model selection by numerically sweeping through a set of values (σ = {1,2,3}) and selecting the value that best reproduced Fig 4C. It is important to note that Fig 4B and 4C were similar across all tested values of σ when the Mexican hat lateral effect was used, while no other lateral effects achieved this similarity at any value of σ. The topographic property of the VAE arises from the lateral effect component of the loss function (Eq 6). As a control, we tested our model with no lateral effects (Fig 5A–5D), and with several different distance functions (Mexican hat, inverted Mexican hat, excitation only, inhibition only; Fig 5F and 5G). The inverted Mexican hat lateral effect is the additive inverse of the Mexican hat function (Eq 6). Excitation-only lateral effect is defined as: (8) and the inhibition-only lateral effect is the additive inverse of the excitation-only lateral effect (Eq 8). From the perspective of probabilistic inference, this regularisation item is equivalent to amending the prior distribution p(z)) and modifies the target function as: (9) where the normalisation factor is a constant. In this form, both the firing sparsity and the lateral effect are expressed within the amended prior distribution p*(z) and the target function is maintained in a standard variational autoencoder framework. The overall total loss function for optimising the topo-VAE model is therefore given by: (10) where Ψ is a matrix representing the pairwise interactions between all the neuron indices in the range [1,M], with each element Ψp,q = ψ(p,q), and γ weights the importance of the KL-lateral effect terms during optimisation. For the model we present in the results, γ was chosen such that the reconstruction score of the model was not decreased by excessive topographic organisation. If γ is set too low, no topography occurs. If γ is set too high, just a few neurons (that are closest neighbours of each other) will dominate the activity in the latent space across all input stimuli, resulting in poor reconstruction. Based on this, we found γ = 20 to be an ideal value (S7 Fig, bottom panel). The encoder component of the model contains a fully connected hidden layer of size 500, with a tanh activation function, and a final linear readout layer with a sigmoid activation function. The reconstruction error of the model is measured using mean squared error. The decoder network is a linear mapping from neural activities Z to the reconstructions of the sensory stimuli . The topo-VAE model was implemented in Python using PyTorch [62] and run on a GPU workstation. All models were trained for 100 epochs using the Adam optimiser with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 400 (found using a random search over hyperparameters to maximise reconstruction score). We recorded full-body movements from 18 healthy right-handed participants in two experimental scenarios. In the natural behaviour scenario (see Figs 1B and S1), subjects performed unconstrained daily tasks in a working kitchen environment. As food preparation and feeding are universal behaviours, the only direction given to subjects was to prepare and eat an omelette. For this modelling work we used only the arm movement data (including wrist but not digits). The average recording time across subjects was 22 minutes. In the second movement scenario, a subject performed planar centre-out reaches in a 20x20 cm horizontal task space (see Fig 1C) to mimic the movement data for the monkey task. The horizontal task space was aligned 20 cm below the subject’s shoulder and centred on the mid-line at 30 cm forward of the chest. Arm movements in both scenarios were recorded at 60 Hz by an XSENS 3D motion tracking suit, a full-body sensor network based on inertial sensors. We used biomechanical models and fusion algorithms (including calibration and validation) to estimate joint angles. Fig 1A shows the biomechanical structure and coordinate system used in this paper. Arm movement datasets were formatted as time series of angles between segments following the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) Euler angle extractions [29] in a ZXY coordinate. For the elbow and the wrist, angular rotations of Z, X and Y represent flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and internal/external rotation, respectively. During planar movements, we used optical tracking as well as the motion tracking suit for capturing the endpoint (hand) position on the task square. Data from the inertial and optical motion tracking systems were synchronised manually via cue-based movements before, during and after the recording period. We computed angular velocity profiles from the recorded data and analysed the natural movement dataset Xnat and the planar movement dataset Xpl. The first two principal components of the planar movements explained over 95% of the total variance, but only half of the variance of the natural movements. This reveals that joint velocities of planar movements are highly constrained, as expected, to a 2-dimensional subspace. We applied the manipulative complexity metric [63] to quantify the complexity of the movements, which is defined as: (11) Where VAFi is the variance captured by the ith PC. Larger values of C indicate higher complexity and a value of C = 1 means that all PCs contribute equally to the total variance. The complexity of planar movements was 0.06, much lower than the natural movement complexity of 0.5. We defined the direction θ and speed v of planar movements in world coordinates: 90°/270° are respectively away from and towards the chest, 180°/0° are to the left and right. At training time, we also pre-process the input data. The empirical distribution of joint angular velocities during movements in our tasks is symmetric, unimodal, with sharp peaks at zero and heavy tails towards large speeds. To ensure equal contributions to model optimisation, these features are standardised without mean centring (since they are already approximately zero-centred, and to preserve the correspondence of a zero-valued input to zero joint angular velocity). This pre-processing also improves the training efficiency and convergence of our model without breaking the spatial structure of natural movements. In addition, since the original kinematic data is sampled at a frequency of 60Hz, we subsample the training data at a depth of 1%, to remove redundancy and improve training times, without significant effects on the outcome of the model. After training, we evaluate the converged model with data from the planar reaching task, which undergoes the same pre-processing steps as the training data. Preferred directions are one of the primary tuning properties used when comparing modelled and recorded neurons in this work. To calculate the preferred direction of a neuron (both modelled and recorded), we use a simple bootstrapping procedure. For each iteration, we draw random points from the dataset conforming to a uniform distribution of movement directions and fit Poisson generalised linear models (GLM) with angular velocity inputs to the firing rate for the sampled timepoints. For a given input X ‐ a T by 2 (number of velocity inputs) matrix ‐ the GLM model predicts a probability mass function of firing rates, y, according to: (12) Sampling y from this distribution gives a T (number of time points) by N (number of neurons) matrix of firing rate estimates. β is a 2 by N matrix of encoding parameters, which is optimised using maximum likelihood estimation. The preferred direction is then calculated from the encoding vector of the GLM as: (13) In these equations, a bootstrapped PD estimate of neuron i is defined by and , the GLM parameters for mapping hand velocity in the y and x directions to firing rate estimates. We take the circular mean of the PD estimates over all bootstrap iterations to find the PD for each neuron. This method of PD calculation is used for both recorded and modelled neurons. To quantify the sensitivity of neurons to specific joints (Fig 6), we individually perturb each input feature of the model and measure the Pearson correlation between individual neurons in the latent space and that feature. Since each joint is represented by three input features (angular velocity in the Z, X, and Y axes), we use the mean of the absolute correlation across all three axes to quantify the sensitivity of a given neuron to a particular joint. We used a combination of previously recorded data in which three rhesus macaques performed a planar, centre-out reaching task while seated, using a two-link planar manipulandum. A cursor displayed on a monitor tracked the position of the manipulandum and provided visual feedback for the monkey as he reached for a target on-screen. The monkey moved the cursor to a central target in the workspace. After a random delay period, 1 of 8 targets spaced evenly in a circle around the central target appeared on the screen and the monkey moved the cursor toward it upon an audible ‘go’ cue. After placing the cursor in the target for a random hold time of 0–500 ms, the monkey received a liquid reward and returned the cursor to the central target. We used 6 experimental sessions across three monkeys; two sessions contain data that has been previously published [64], and the rest will be published alongside this study. All procedures were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of Northwestern University under protocol #IS00000367. Once a monkey was trained on the experimental apparatus, a 96-channel microelectrode array with 1 mm iridium-oxide coated electrodes (Blackrock Microsystems, Inc.) was pneumatically inserted in Brodmann’s area 2, near the intraparietal sulcus [64]. The implantation site was chosen to avoid cerebral vasculature and maximise proximal arm representation. All surgery was performed under isoflurane gas anaesthesia (1–2 percent) except during intraoperative recording to identify the arm representations, when the monkey was transitioned to a mixture of <0.5% isoflurane and remifentanil (0.4 ug/kg/min). The data were recorded from the microelectrode array using the Cerebus multichannel data recording system (Blackrock Microsystems, Inc.). Thresholded waveforms and timing of behavioural task events were synchronised and recorded for offline analyses. The position of the handle was recorded at 1kHz. We discriminated single neurons using Offline Sorter (Plexon, Inc., Dallas TX). 383 recorded neurons were found to be suitable for subsequent analysis.

The sum of correlations across joints is then normalised such that a neuron with equal elbow, shoulder and wrist tuning would be positioned at 33.33% for each joint in the above plots. Each plot shows the relative tuning of each neuron (one data point) to joint inputs for the following pairs: (A) Elbow vs Shoulder, (B) Wrist vs Elbow, and (C) Wrist vs Shoulder. The colour of each dot is set by using their x, y, and z location in the plot to drive their respective red, green, and blue colour channels. The 3D plot of neurons for wrist, elbow and shoulder together are shown in Fig 6 in the main text. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012614.s006 (PNG) Effect of changing the firing rate prior (top) and lateral effect cost weighting (bottom) on the tuning maps in the latent space (left hand side) and reconstruction scores (R2 score, natural-trained model reconstruction planar reaching data) (right hand side).

The shares were up 22%. The data storage management company topped Wall Street's estimates and offered up strong fourth-quarter guidance. Pure Storage also upped its previously forecasted full-year outlook. "We're very pleased," CEO Charles Giancarlo told CNBC's "Closing Bell: Overtime" on Tuesday. "This is the first time ever where a hyperscaler, for their standard customer-facing storage, is going to be using a system vendor ... and what we're providing them is a very cost effective, high performance solution that can replace 90% of their storage." Pure Storage refrained from sharing the name of the contracted hyperscaler company, but Wall Street analysts regarded news as a big win contributing to the post-earnings pop. A hyperscaler refers to the major cloud computing companies with massive data center that can rapidly size up to meet shifting storage and demands. Some of the key players with major cloud units include Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta. Piper Sandler upgraded shares to an overweight rating following the results. Shares are already up about 50% this year as investors seek out alternative methods to playing artificial intelligence trends and companies search for new ways to manage AI's data-heavy needs. Analyst James Fish said the contract creates a "pure opportunity ahead" and "removes the "coinflip risk" previously price into the stock. Agreements with additional hyperscalers represent and additional potential upside catalyst for the stock, he wrote, moving to a $76 price target. "Hyperscaler interest in flash creates a secular tailwind for the space, as these vendors have historically represented 60-70% of [hard disk drive] shipments," wrote James Fish. "AI throws 'gas on the fire' for utilizing" its storage operating system. Fish isn't alone in his bullish take on the stock. Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson called the news a "margin accretive" win for the company and upped his price target to $75. "We see no reason to shift our constructive view on PSTG, given the promising incremental revenue opportunity and our continued belief that PSTG offers a superior enterprise storage solution," he wrote.

Title: Why Constellium (CSTM) is the Best Aluminum and Aluminum Mining Stock To Buy?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-constellium-cstm-best-aluminum-133403294.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Aluminum and Aluminum Mining Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Constellium SE (NYSE:CSTM) stands against other best aluminum and aluminum mining stocks to buy. Aluminum is a versatile and lightweight metal known for its low density and being roughly one-third the weight of steel or copper. Its unique properties, such as high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and excellent conductivity, make it essential in various sectors, including transportation, construction, and packaging. One of the primary drivers of aluminum’s growth is the increasing focus on sustainability across industries. With its recyclability and lower carbon footprint compared to other metals, aluminum is becoming a go-to material for green technologies. The automotive and electric vehicle (EV) industry, in particular, is driving demand for aluminum as manufacturers seek lightweight materials to improve efficiency and range. By incorporating aluminum into vehicle designs, automakers also meet regulatory standards for emissions reduction. Aluminum also plays a critical role in the renewable energy sector, as the production of solar and wind products requires significant amounts of aluminum. In addition to these industries, aluminum’s unique properties make it an ideal material for food packaging, and the construction sector, including infrastructure, and development. In the report, Opportunities for Aluminium in a Post-COVID Economy, conducted by CRU International, the global demand for aluminum is projected to rise by nearly 40% by 2030. The aluminum sector will need to produce an additional 33.3 million tonnes to meet this demand, with production increasing from 86.2 million tonnes in 2020 to 119.5 million tonnes by 2030 across all industrial sectors. According to the report, two-thirds of this demand growth is expected to come from China, which will require 12.3 Mt, whereas the rest of Asia will add a further 8.6 Mt. North American region will require 5.1 Mt and Europe 4.8 Mt. Together, these four regions alone will account for more than 90% of the additional aluminum required globally.

In an interview with CNBC on November 12, William Oplinger, President and CEO of Alcoa, said that he considers the Chinese market a crucial factor in the aluminum industry. He noted that China’s enormous appetite for commodities, particularly in the green sector, has a significant impact on the aluminum market. China currently produces around 45 million metric tons of aluminum, out of a global market of 75 million metric tons. However, the country has capped its production capacity at 45 million metric tons, meaning that any growth in demand will be met through secondary and recycling sources. In terms of near-term dynamics, Oplinger expressed optimism about the demand for aluminum, citing continued strength in the packaging business, growth in the automotive and transportation sector, and potential growth in building construction spurred by lower interest rates worldwide. Looking ahead to the long term, Oplinger emphasized the importance of aluminum in the energy transition economy, highlighting growth opportunities in areas such as electrical conductors, photovoltaic cells, and electric vehicles. On November 29, China’s finance ministry announced that it would be making significant changes to its export tax rebate policy, set to take effect on December 1. The ministry announced that it will cancel the export tax rebate for several products, including aluminum and copper products. The announcement had an immediate impact on the market, with aluminum prices surging on the London Metal Exchange. Traders are anticipating that the cancellation of the export tax rebate for aluminum will curb the heavy flow of Chinese aluminum exports, leading to a reduction in global supply and a subsequent increase in prices. As the aluminum industry continues to evolve amidst a changing global landscape, one thing remains certain, the growing demand for this versatile metal looks bright. With growing demand, shifting market dynamics, and emerging trends shaping the sector, now is an exciting time for investors to explore opportunities in the aluminum market. For this article, we sifted through Base Metal ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 companies that are involved in the production, extraction, processing, or sale of aluminum and aluminum-related products. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, as of the third quarter. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A closeup of a freshly rolled aluminum product being produced in a factory. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34 Constellium SE (NYSE:CSTM) specializes in aluminum rolled products, structural parts, and extruded products for the aerospace, automotive, and packaging industries. The company’s clients include leading automakers and beverage companies. Constellium SE (NYSE:CSTM) is investing heavily in recycling technologies to enhance its sustainability profile and improve operational efficiency. On November 12, 2024, Constellium SE (NYSE:CSTM) made a significant announcement regarding a major breakthrough in aluminum recycling for the automotive industry. The company successfully implemented Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) technology at an industrial scale. This innovation addresses a significant challenge in automotive aluminum recycling, which is the proper segregation of alloy families. Traditionally, mixed alloys from scrap were downcycled, limiting their use in high-value applications. However, the LIBS sorting technology enables rapid and accurate sorting of aluminum scrap, achieving over 95% purity for both alloy families. This means that recycled aluminum can be used to produce high-quality solutions without compromising material integrity. This achievement has the potential to transform aluminum recycling practices on a global scale. The company’s Vice President of Global Automotive, Dieter Holl, highlighted the significance of this innovation, stating that it is an “unprecedented leap forward for the industry” and allows for the recovery of high-quality alloys from pre-consumer scrap, reducing the carbon footprint and supporting customers’ sustainability goals. Overall, CSTM ranks 3rd on our list of best aluminum and aluminum mining stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of CSTM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CSTM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Managed by Fortlake—recently named Fixed Income Manager of the Year in Australia— the fund’s units will be transformed into digital tokens, a process called tokenization, where real-world assets (RWAs) are represented on a blockchain, the companies announced exclusively to Decrypt. The collaborations seek to simplify asset management by bringing traditional financial assets on-chain and expanding access to decentralized finance (DeFi). The trio believes the fund’s tokenization leads to new opportunities within DeFi, “such as integrations with lending markets, use as a high-yield stablecoin savings solution, or as margin trading collateral.” “Partnering with Backed, Sonic, and Chainlink to tokenize the Sigma Opportunities Fund is a substantial development in the way we provide access to our fund for the rapidly growing digital asset investor base,” Christian Baylis, founder and CIO of Fortlake said in a statement. “We believe this collaboration marks the beginning of a new era in traditional asset management fundraising.” As a global fixed-income investment strategy targeting high yield, the fund targets returns between 7 and 10%, according to Fortlake’s own product disclosure statement. Fortlake has over $1 billion in assets under management across all of its funds. Tokenization will occur using Backed’s Tokenization-as-a-Service (TaaS) platform. Those tokens will be backed 1:1 by units, ensuring their value corresponds to the real-time Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund—essentially the fund’s worth per share. “Tokenizing the Fortlake Sigma Fund is a major step forward in the blockchain landscape,” said Adam Levi, co-founder of Backed. “It showcases how institutions can use blockchain technology to simplify back-office operations and reach new capital.” The tokens will then be integrated into the Sonic blockchain, a platform capable of processing 10,000 transactions per second with one-second finality. Chainlink’s SmartData technology also ensures the fund’s value is accurately recorded on the blockchain, the trio said. Chainlink’s Proof of Reserves feature verifies that the fund always backs the tokens, so investors know their assets are secure. Chainlink also uses CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) to allow these tokens to work across multiple blockchains. The partnership points to the growing interest in blockchain-based solutions for asset management. Recently, stablecoin issuer Tether launched Hadron, a tokenization platform for digital and real-world assets that lets users tokenize various assets, from stocks and bonds to stablecoins and loyalty points. A few weeks back, Japan’s SBI Digital Markets announced it is developing a cross-border framework for tokenized assets, connecting regulated digital asset exchanges across multiple regions to boost liquidity and lower costs. With institutions like BlackRock and JP Morgan exploring tokenization, the Bank of America predicts the sector could reach $16 trillion in value within the next 15 years. "The future of tokenization is accelerating toward greater institutional adoption," Jakob Kronbichler, CEO and co-founder of DeFi credit marketplace Clearpool, told Decrypt. "While tokenized treasuries and stablecoins currently dominate RWA use cases, the future promises growing traction in real estate, private credit, and other asset classes like commodities." Edited by Sebastian Sinclair Editor's note: This story was updated after publication to update the amount of assets under management at Fortlake. Comments from Clearpool have also been added.

Title: Why Is Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB) Among the Dividend Kings You Should Consider?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-kimberly-clark-corporation-kmb-131610948.html
Time Published: 2024-12-04T13:16:10Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Dividend Kings List: Top 15. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) stands against the other dividend kings you should know about. Dividend Kings are a distinguished group of companies that have achieved at least 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. While some of these companies are part of the S&P index, the two categories are not entirely overlapping. The appeal of Dividend Kings became especially clear after the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. During this time, numerous companies either reduced or suspended their dividends, leaving income-focused investors disappointed. Many had assumed that dividend-paying stocks were inherently lower risk, only to face steep share price drops alongside payout cuts. However, Dividend Kings stand out for their remarkable consistency, boasting 50 years of uninterrupted dividend increases. This long history of reliable payouts provides a sense of stability, even in volatile market conditions. Investors often gravitate toward firms with a track record of consistent dividend growth, as such companies tend to perform well in declining or stagnant markets. Even during periods of strong market performance, dividend growers have captured a significant share of the gains. Following a long-term dividend growth strategy can aid in compounding returns for investors. A T. Rowe Price report highlighted that, between 1985 and 2022, companies in the Russell index that consistently increased dividends outperformed the broader benchmark. Furthermore, these companies exhibited lower price volatility compared to the overall market. Earning income through dividend stocks is a gradual process that requires patience and a commitment to long-term investing. These stocks are particularly suited for investors with a long-term horizon, as they have consistently outpaced inflation over time. According to data from Morningstar and Yale University's Robert Shiller, since 1871, the market’s dividends per share have grown at an annualized rate 1.6 percentage points higher than inflation. Moreover, the gap between dividend growth and inflation has widened in recent years. Over the past 50 years, dividends have outpaced inflation by 2.5 percentage points annually, and in the last 20 years, the margin has grown to 4.6 percentage points per year. During market rallies, dividend-growing stocks may underperform as investor enthusiasm and momentum often take precedence over fundamentals such as valuation and business quality. This trend has been especially noticeable in the recent past, with dividend stocks lagging behind the broader market. Nonetheless, maintaining a long-term strategy centered on dividend growth can be advantageous, as the benefits accumulate over time with each increase in payouts. Companies with solid fundamentals and robust financial stability are typically well-positioned to sustain and grow their dividends. In contrast, smaller or emerging businesses often prioritize reinvesting earnings into their operations to fuel growth. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend kings with the highest yields. Our Methodology: To create this list, we examined a set of over 50 dividend king companies, recognized for consistently increasing dividends for 50 years or more. From this group, we selected companies with the highest dividend yields as of December 3 and organized them in ascending order based on their yield, from lowest to highest. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database of 900 as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A stack of disposable diapers in the foreground with a mother and her baby in the background. Dividend Yield as of December 3: 3.51% Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) is an American consumer goods company that offers a wide range of related products to its consumers. Since the pandemic, many large consumer goods companies have increased their prices to counteract rising costs, which are now starting to stabilize from their peak levels. This has led to increased competition from more affordable brands as consumers focus on getting better value for their money. Kimberly-Clark Corporation peaked in August 2020, trading at approximately $158 per share. Since then, the stock has been unable to reach this price again and has actually fallen by nearly 13% during this period. However, in the past 12 months, the stock has surged by over 11%. In the third quarter of 2024, Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) reported revenue of $4.95 billion, which fell by 4% from the same period last year. Under the Powering Care strategy, the company is fast-tracking its innovation pipeline and cutting costs to provide higher-quality consumer solutions across all price ranges. It is also streamlining its operational structure to become more agile and responsive in the market. The company is on track to achieve strong growth in operating profit, margins, and EPS in 2024 while continuing to invest in sustaining business momentum into 2025. Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB)'s cash generation remained strong this year. In the first nine months of 2024, the company reported an operating cash flow of $2.4 billion, up from $2.3 billion in the prior-year period. During this period, it returned $2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. It is one of the best dividend kings on our list as the company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 52 years. Currently, it pays a quarterly dividend of $1.22 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.51%, as of December 3. The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) grew to 45 in Q3 2024, from 43 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $1 billion. Overall KMB ranks 10th on our list of the dividend kings you should know about. While we acknowledge the potential of KMB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KMB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: After Ripple’s XRP surge price now compares to America’s top 100 companies by market cap

XRP could outshine 86% of S&P 500 firms, including Pfizer and Citigroup. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. XRP’s price surge propelled its market capitalization past $150 billion, which would place it among the top 100 companies in the United States if it were a corporate entity. Data from CryptoSlate shows that the digital asset, whose value more than doubled in the past month to as high as $2.82 on Dec. 3, significantly outperformed Bitcoin by a staggering 200%. While XRP’s price has slightly retraced to $2.61 as of press time, the asset still registered an impressive 409% increase after the November US elections. Nevertheless, this surge has helped boost XRP’s market cap to around $150 billion, a more than five-times increase from around $28 billion at the beginning of November. XRP now ranks as the third-largest crypto, trailing only Bitcoin and Ethereum but surpassing Tether’s USDT stablecoin, the Binance-backed BNB Coin and Solana network. Market analysts attribute this growth to several factors, including growing institutional interest. There is optimism that a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the upcoming administration could further benefit both XRP and Ripple. According to CompanyMarketCap data, if XRP were classified as a standalone company, its market cap would rank it among the top 100 US firms, surpassing notable companies like Nike and financial institutions like Charles Schwab. Further analysis with Stock Analysis suggests that XRP would be the 68th largest company in the S&P 500, surpassing 86% of the stocks within the index. Specifically, XRP would be valued higher than pharmaceutical giant Pfizer ($144 billion), Citigroup ($136 billion), and defense contractor Lockheed Martin ($122.5 billion). However, it would trail behind BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, with a market value of $160 billion, and Uber, the ride-hailing transportation company, with a valuation of $150 billion. XRP’s market value would also be more than three times greater than that of NASDAQ, valued at $46.55 billion, and gaming firm Electronic Arts, worth $43.98 billion. The S&P 500 Index, which tracks 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the US, is a key performance benchmark for the American stock market. While it is not exclusively based on market cap, it is widely regarded as a critical measure of the performance of major US equities.

Title: Conservative Microsoft Eyes Bitcoin As MicroStrategy And Nvidia Lead

Nvidia earns profits from bitcoin mining, while Microsoft contemplates investing in bitcoin (Photo ... [+] by Rasit Aydogan/Anadolu via Getty Images) Students of history know that even the most iconoclastic revolutionary sooner or later becomes a conservative. It’s no different in the tech sector. Those AI founders who are currently tearing up the rulebook? The decentralization pioneers building the next iteration of the web? One day they too will be legacy firms, grappling with upstart innovators in the battle to remain relevant. So when Silicon Valley aristocracy like Microsoft changes tack and embraces an emerging technology like bitcoin, everyone needs to sit up and take notice. Next month, the software giant that did so much to create the modern world will vote on ‘an assessment in investing in bitcoin’ — admittedly, in the teeth of opposition from many on its board. It’s not Microsoft’s sheer size that makes this so significant, although its staggering $3 trillion valuation can’t be ignored. It’s that the philosophy of bitcoin and blockchain runs directly counter to the principles of centralization on which today’s Big Tech monopolies were built. Were Microsoft to buy into bitcoin, it would be a not-so-tacit admission that the future is decentralized, and that even the world’s biggest companies have little choice but to turn their most dearly-held assumptions on their head. Microsoft is considering Bitcoin as an investment (Photo by Jeenah Moon/Getty Images) Let’s not get ahead of ourselves: there’s perhaps an equal chance Microsoft shareholders will vote not to put bitcoin on its balance sheet…at least, not just yet. The very fact they’re considering it at all, however, has ramifications for the whole crypto industry, financial markets, governments, regulators — in fact, for all of us. The early years of bitcoin were defined by intense skepticism from financial, political, and corporate elites. This didn’t stop risk-taking enterprises like MicroStrategy from going hard and going early. Michael Saylor was roundly derided for his bet on bitcoin, but the joke is now on his critics: the strategy has been insanely lucrative, with MicroStrategy reported to have made a profit of $11 billion on its investment at the last count. “Oil tanker” enterprises with a low risk appetite like Microsoft were never going to pivot so quickly. The question is, why now? Doesn’t Microsoft’s slowness, its caution, its which-way-the-wind-blows posture mean it’s late to the bitcoin party? MicroStrategy continues to invest in Bitcoin (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via ... [+] Getty Images) Quite the opposite. Microsoft is a conservative organisation, and its consideration of bitcoin is founded on a (perhaps, grudging) acceptance of important geopolitical, macroeconomic, and adoption trends. Thanks in part to visionaries like MicroStrategy along with major financial institutions like BlackRock, not to mention growing political and regulatory approval for crypto and its derivatives, bitcoin’s risk profile has changed. While Nvidia has not directly invested in Bitcoin, the company has significantly benefited from the cryptocurrency sector, particularly through the demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used in Bitcoin mining. This demand has contributed to Nvidia's substantial revenue growth. Notably, Nvidia faced a shareholder lawsuit alleging that it misrepresented the extent of its revenue derived from cryptocurrency mining. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear Nvidia's appeal in this case, highlighting the company's indirect involvement in the cryptocurrency industry. Meanwhile, blockchain continues to innovate, with Layer 2 solutions adding new functionalities on a seemingly daily basis, and powering increasing convergence between the fiat and crypto ecosystems. These are just some of the key factors driving bitcoin’s transformation from a speculative asset into the basis for a conservative investment strategy. Microsoft might be classed as a “follower” compared to MicroStrategy, but it could well be a bellwether for other conservative corporations. There are many tech entrepreneurs who can relate to President-elect Trump. They see him (much as they see themselves) as the Great Disruptor: someone unafraid to shake things up, to shoot first and ask questions later; to coin a phrase, someone who moves fast and breaks things. On bitcoin, however, Trump is more of a weathervane than a signpost. His position has shifted with the wind — it wasn’t so long ago that he was calling it “a scam against the dollar”. His wholehearted embrace of bitcoin may have moved the markets towards the long-promised milestone of $100,000 mere days after his election, but the most significant developments were already in train before he’d even announced his candidacy. These were carried out not on the financial markets but in the corridors of power. Trump supporting Bitcoin. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images) You don’t have to be a bitcoin obsessive to know that Congress (along with other legislatures worldwide) has been working hard on developing new laws governing crypto and digital assets. This isn’t the place to cover them all, but they include legislation like FIT 21 in the US and, of course, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), widely recognised as the world’s most ambitious and comprehensive set of regulations for crypto. The intricacies and specifics of these new regulations are less important than the wider trend they illustrate. Governments, which fought for so long against the horrifying concept of money and financial networks they couldn’t control, have finally accepted bitcoin and blockchain as a fact of life. They are now drawing up a roadmap to institutional adoption. The momentum is all in the direction of regulation that brings crypto within established financial structures; this regulatory clarity in turn breeds the kind of confidence that makes even the likes of Microsoft consider moving bitcoin onto their balance sheet. The entry of conservative corporations into bitcoin has profound consequences for the currency’s trajectory. Naturally, when skeptics of this size change their mind and add bitcoin to their treasury, it is a huge vote of confidence that increases the legitimacy, not only of the currency, but of the whole ecosystem that surrounds it. Of course, Microsoft is defined by more than its age and outlook. There’s its balance sheet and previously-mentioned valuation — whales don’t come much bigger. If Microsoft enters bitcoin in a big way, it would cause tsunami-size ripples throughout the market. Moreover, remember that the company’s operating systems run most of the computers on every desk and in every home (and a decent proportion of mobile devices, too). It’s inconceivable that Microsoft would be content simply to hold bitcoin without finding ways to add value to both its business and its balance sheet by developing new crypto- and blockchain-powered utilities, and integrating them into its software empire. These are wild times for crypto, but the adoption by ‘conservative’ enterprises could also herald a new period of stabilization by reducing the influence of retail speculation on the price. A more stable bitcoin would, in turn, attract even more interest from corporations that were once reluctant to invest. Whichever way Microsoft shareholders vote, they should remember that success in business today requires the agility and drive to constantly rethink, reinvigorate, react, and reinvent.

Title: 2025: Intel Stock's Comeback Year?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/04/2025-intel-stocks-comeback-year/

LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 14: The Intel logo is seen outside a pop-up store on Oxford Street ... [+] on November 14, 2024 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) Next year promises to be an important one for Intel stock. Intel is likely to see its bread-and-butter CPU sales pick up with a more compelling portfolio of products and recovery in demand. Meanwhile, the company’s foundry business also faces a moment of truth of sorts, as it looks to commercialize its cutting-edge 18A process. And with Donald Trump back in the White House next year, Intel’s sizable base of U.S. manufacturing could put the company in a unique position of strength, given the pro-American policies of the new administration. Below, we take a look at what to expect from Intel in 2025. See our Intel upside analysis on How Intel Stock Can Surge 3x To $60. On the other hand, see our counter scenario which explores how Intel Stock Could Dive To $10. The decrease in INTC stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 6% in 2021, -47% in 2022, and 95% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So what are some of the factors that could help Intel stock rebound? In a completely separate, shocking recent development with UnitedHealthcare’s CEO shot in Manhattan this week, see What’s Next For UNH Stock? Intel has lost considerable ground in the CPU market in recent years. While rival AMD has been gaining share, the broader pivot to AI accelerators is also hurting demand for the company’s GPUs. However, Intel’s latest lineup looks more promising. The Lunar Lake chip designed for laptops and ultra-compact devices as well as the Arrow Lake chip for desktops, are manufactured by TSMC using its advanced 3nm process. This could give the company a better shot at competing with AMD in the near term. The broader recovery of the PC market, coupled with stronger products, is likely to help Intel boost Intel revenues in 2024. Moreover, after close to two years of massive investments in AI chip data, companies could begin to boost CPU spending led by general-purpose workloads and server refresh cycles. Intel’s latest server chips, such as the Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids are also expected to compete more favorably with AMD, using the new 3 nanometers “Intel 3” process node. Intel’s revenue guidance for Q4 was also better than expected, with the company projecting sales of between $13.3 billion to $14.3 billion, indicating that we could begin to see some of these trends play out. Separately, see What’s Happening With Bitcoin Miner MARA Stock? Intel is betting big on its 18A process, which it considers its most advanced yet, to turn around its foundry business. The process produces chips with technologies including RibbonFET gate-all-around transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery, which are expected to boost performance and power efficiency. Intel has secured big contracts with this technology, including with the U.S. Department of Defense for the RAMP-C program, which seeks to bring leading-edge semiconductor technology domestically. Other high-profile customers include Amazon and Microsoft, which intend to design custom chips, including AI accelerators. Intel announced in early August that it had reached critical milestones with chips made using the 18A process, noting that the chip had powered on, booted operating systems, and was operational within Intel. The company expects external customers to tape out (move from design to foundry for manufacturing) their first 18A designs in 2025, with enterprise-scale production to begin thereafter. If Intel executes this transition effectively, it could shift the narrative around the stock, justifying the significant investments made in its foundry business over the past few years. A Trump Boost For Intel’s FoundryPresident-elect Donald Trump’s emphasis on boosting U.S. manufacturing could work in Intel’s favor, given its sizable domestic fabrication footprint. There’s a possibility that Intel could see considerable regulatory support aimed at boosting domestic chip production. For example, the new administration could look at imposing tariffs that make it more expensive for foreign fabrication companies to produce and export chips to the U.S. A stronger emphasis on domestic production, either through tariffs or via other policies, could drive more business to Intel. Intel’s foundry division - which produces chips for third-party customers - could also see stronger demand, particularly as companies look to rely on U.S. suppliers to avoid potential duties. Semiconductors are critical for national security - an area that Trump has consistently emphasized - and Intel’s domestic manufacturing might be viewed as contributing to protecting U.S. technological independence. Intel could also see a higher number of contracts awarded to it from the government, being the only American semiconductor player that designs and fabricates leading-edge logic chips in the U.S. This means that the company’s domestic chip supply chain could help it win more contracts under Trump, who boosted military spending over his last term. Although Nvidia remains the undisputed leader in the AI market at the moment, with AMD coming in a distant second, Intel is expanding its presence in the AI processor space with its Gaudi 2 and upcoming Gaudi 3 AI accelerators. We believe that this is an opportunity for the likes of Intel to gain some ground. The AI market at large could gradually shift from the process of model training to inferencing, which is the process of generating outputs and answers from trained models. The process of inferencing is less computationally intensive, and it’s possible that these tasks can be handled adequately well by AI processors from the likes of Intel and AMD. Costs are also becoming a concern for end customers of AI chips. The economics of the AI business remain weak, with heavy investments in GPU chips yielding minimal revenues and there’s a real possibility that from 2025, companies could be a lot more circumspect with their AI spending. Although Gaudi sales have been lackluster, Intel’s newest Gaudi 3 accelerator costs about half as much as Nvidia’s chips, and this could make for a more favorable price-to-performance tradeoff. The shift toward inferencing is a key reason to consider Selling Nvidia, Buying AMD Stock. Intel stock trades at about $24 per share currently or 25x consensus 2025 earnings, which is reasonable in our view given the above factors. Intel is also expected to return to growth next year with consensus pointing to about 6% revenue expansion. We value Intel stock at about $27 per share, slightly ahead of the current market price.

Title: Cushman & Wakefield’s Joanne Podell Explains Retail’s Dramatic Changes

© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy With 25 years of experience and retail deals the scale of which would make an office broker’s eyes pop, there are few better to ask about the state of today’s brick-and-mortar leasing environment than Joanne Podell. The executive vice chair for retail services at Cushman & Wakefield (CWK) sat down with Commercial Observer shortly before Thanksgiving to talk about all the travails the industry has been through in the last several years, putting into perspective the ups and downs that have taken place and pointing out that it’s a good time to be a retail broker. Some of Podell’s biggest clients include TD Bank, which she assisted in its expansion in the New York City market by adding over 50 new locations, as well as Nike when in 2016 Podell negotiated a 70,000-square-foot lease for its flagship at 650 Fifth Avenue. Most recently, Podell (pronounced “Poh-DELL”) helped Chinese retailer Miniso in its New York City expansion with a 5,000-square-foot deal at 150 Broadway in June. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Commercial Observer: Is the retail apocalypse officially over? Joanne Podell: I think there never was one. What a terrible word, and there’s so many circumstances around it that we have to consider. I mean, the world fell apart, so retail is just a part of everything else that was happening — theater, tourism. It was a terrible confluence of lots of different things. Thrown in there was everybody shopping online, and how is that going to affect everything? From the beginning, the National Retail Federation and people like me were saying, “Yeah, e-commerce will definitely take some of the retail business, but also enhance the retail business.” Because people go online, they look at what they like, and some of them want to just go into a store and take a look at it, right? Then there’s what they call the halo effect of retail that goes online, where people walk into a store, they shop around, they go home, and they order something online. So, you know, it’s amorphous. It’s very hard to just define it the way that “apocalypse” was used. That was silly. Who were the retailers who survived it and why? The ones that struggled the most and still do are because of the office. Most affected were those in food and beverage, obviously, because people are in the office three or four days instead of five. But if a woman wants a coat, she’s an office worker, she’s in New York, then she’s going to shop Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday for the coat, right? It’s not like she’s never going to buy it. So I think F&B was hurt. But every restaurant is packed all the time, and the bars are packed all the time. So F&B is back. It seems like when it comes to F&B, when one restaurant closes, another opens quickly in its place? It’s usually the second or third generation of the restaurant that ends up making it, and that’s unfortunate. And the reason is the costs to build out, and get the licensing and permitting, are just prohibitive. So the guy that gets the space the next, he’s got all of that in place. That’s why second-generation restaurants lease very quickly, because oftentimes the equipment is there. If it’s not, all the fittings are there. And so it’s an easy transition for the second or third restaurant. That’s too bad, because some of these poor guys, they put their heart and soul, their savings, into building something, and then the next guy gets the benefit. Tell us about some of your more interesting recent deals. My business has changed a little bit. We were doing a lot of flagships, and so that’s a great business, but now it seems like we have a steady flow of a variety of deals. We represent Miniso out of China, and we’re building a portfolio for them slowly. They had considered doing a flagship, and they said, “You know what? That’s not the direction we want to go.” We represent Citizens Bank. We’re very carefully looking at their portfolio and where they need to move if their leases are up or if they need to stay where they are. Luxottica, we represented them, it was filling in where they were missing stores. So it continues to be the steady flow of the retailers that we work with. We also represent landlords, and I actually love the balance of representing a landlord and a tenant. You get a much better perspective of the market. You see what landlords are willing to do, how they feel that they can create deals and get them done. It’s a good part of the business, so we do that as well. A lot of the recent buyers of New York retail properties are foreign buyers. Why is that? You stabilize what your rent is going to be from a retailer’s point of view. Here’s a negative and why people never bought: It’s because your program changes. For the first couple of years, you’re an apparel store, you include shoes and handbags, right? Then you figure out, “I’m not getting an ROI on that as much as I should. What do I need that big of a store for? I’ll streamline my store 20 percent, I’ll pay less rent. I’m going to do fine.” So they don’t buy, they lease, so they have that flexibility. Not the same when you buy, but when you buy — and you’re a conglomerate, you can buy a building — you could break it up for multiple tenants. Kering’s purchase of 715-717 Fifth Avenue, right? They have 13 brands, so they’re in a position where if one brand doesn’t work, they’ll put another brand in. But single-brand ownership doesn’t make any sense at all. So it’s very unique that they buy. Are foreign buyers leasing space too, or are they just buying? There’s tremendous interest, but they’re not just buying, they’re coming again to lease. The foreign companies are coming back — particularly the Chinese companies. We have another company that’s coming in, too. They’re here already and they’re going to expand in a more significant way. I can’t tell you the name yet. China is becoming an interesting place to look for retail. One of the things that hurt retail after the pandemic was that the Chinese investors and tourists did not come back quickly. Are tenant-owners expanding outside of New York? They have to grow their business. That’s their job. If they don’t, it tanks their stock. So they’re out there making, hopefully, very good decisions on expansion, and that’s a great thing, because all of that leads to more jobs, more manufacturing, hopefully some of it in the U.S. The malls, very competitive. We are working on getting space for Miniso in some of the local malls, and there is tremendous competition for space. Look at the investment from American companies in retail. Look at Acadia. They’re a great company. They’re buying a lot of retail. Empire State Realty Trust — for years, you never heard about them buying retail, it was really about maintaining and redoing the Empire State Building and maintaining a very strong office portfolio. They just bought a bunch of retail property in Williamsburg. Are there any neighborhoods that haven’t bounced back? The city is so strong, I would give you an answer if I knew one. I don’t know what’s not bouncing back. It seems like it’s hard to find good space in most residential markets, and certainly you look at Flatiron, SoHo — very strong. Financial District, Downtown — good activity there as well. Can we finally stop talking about experiential retail? Many years ago, department stores had makeup departments, right? And we’re talking about 25 years ago. You would go in there, and a woman behind the counter would say, “Try this lipstick.” What is that? That is and always was experiential retail. If you want to take it all the way to the other side, Nike with a basketball court, sure, very nice. But is it critical, or that important? No. I think a good product, good inventory, good service — those are the things that make retail successful, and understanding who your customer is, which probably is the No. 1 thing to mention. There’s been a big culling of retail brokers in the last few years. What are the effects of that on the market? I don’t know that there were layoffs, as this is a very hard business. It takes a long time to be good at it, and this is not about ego, because you don’t have to be a genius to be in this business. But it takes perseverance. It takes a willingness to work very hard to be successful. I think the layoffs come from people who recognize that this is not the business for them. It literally can take five years before someone can make a decent living. And you ask any broker, they’re going to tell you the same thing: It takes years to learn this business. And not to disparage other kinds of brokerage, but retail is so unique, the nuances in retail require a different knowledge base. You need to know this market and, as the market changes, you have to recognize the changes in the market. You have to be aware of all the different kinds of tenants that are coming into the market, and then you need to work hard and build relationships. When I started, I worked seven days a week. I walked the streets, I met lots of other brokers like myself. That’s a very different thing than other kinds of businesses. How can a young broker get their foot in the door? It really depends on the mindset of the broker. Do they want to work by themselves and maybe represent a few people? For me, I could never do the job well if I didn’t have a big team — we do a lot of work in terms of providing information. You know, information is king. It’s not acceptable or viable for a tenant or a landlord to make a decision without knowing what’s going on in the market, what else is available, and the types of companies that are out there. How am I going to know all that? Every senior broker has a different perspective, so I can only speak for myself. I don’t want anybody coming to work knowing they’re not going to walk away with $1 at the end of the day. So, for me, I’d rather make sure that my guys have a salary of some kind or a draw. I think it’s important. I’m not talking about getting them hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, but you’ve got to do that. It’s also your obligation as a senior broker, someone who’s been in the business a long time, you got to train these people. You got to teach them. They have to learn. They have to be part of your life, they have to be in your office, listening to conversations, learning about negotiation. All those things take time. What does it mean for the brokers who survived the last eight years or so? I think that if you’re hardworking and you like what you do, you can be great at it. It’s just your commitment. What role does data play for you? I love information. I love data. I think 20-something years ago, I think I was one of the first people to hire someone with a clicker to count how many people walked in front of a store. I desperately believe that without data, you can’t do a good job. You can’t provide enough information to your client. At the end of the day, I always tell people the same thing: It’s intuition and information. You need the historical information of that neighborhood. You can get specific information, but the nuances of the neighborhood — that street is always too dark or that one tenant that’s been there forever is really never leaving. The things that don’t show up in Placer.ai data come from you being on the street and understanding it. As for Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is the market there still going to continue in the direction it’s been heading for the last 10 years or so? ESRT just invested a lot of money there. Acadia owns property there, right? It’s a good trading area. And I think as long as the rents stay realistic, you’ve got a good demographic. What are rents like compared to before the pandemic? In some cases, we’re almost back. In some cases, it is over. Certain neighborhoods are stable. Because there’s no particular new growth, tenants can only pay so much. There’s no new development that would cause everybody to say, “Oh my god, there’s going to be additional traffic coming there, right?” So they stay pretty much the same. Flatiron, those rents came back so quickly, but they are all stable because of the same thing. One of the problems that we had historically, which we certainly had a number of years ago, was places like Flatiron got just too expensive. You need tenants to stay in business. It’s not a good look for people to go out of business because they can’t afford the rent. That’s probably my biggest concern. I know it’s counterintuitive, because brokers get paid on bigger deals, but I want people to stay in business. Now people need security, that’s tough. Theft is at a higher number than it was before. So those are the challenges that we have. Organized retail theft has been a problem for several years now. Do you think the situation is improving? I think 34th Street looks much better. There was a good amount of time after the pandemic when it was just awful. I think the business improvement district, they’ve done an amazing job. Look, I don’t want to be political, but I can tell you that it appears to me that it looks better. Fifth Avenue — recently I saw some poor families there, but I’m not seeing what I used to see. What do you think of some of the chains like Foot Locker, Red Lobster and Blink Fitness filing for bankruptcy? There’s always bankruptcy. That’s normal. Some people make good decisions and commit the right amount of money to growth and to development, and they can outlive their competition. Jeff Bezos said this and I totally believe it: Everybody will go bankrupt at some point, including Amazon. Now to the casino in Times Square — what do you think of that? Is it good or is it bad? I think if there is going to be a casino, it should be there. I think it’s the right place and I understand the challenges to the office market, and I recognize that we have to increase security for it. There’s a lot that has to be done to make it work. But the amount of revenue that would come from it would be just crazy. And the city could use it. It’d be a lot better than charging $9 for people to drive into Manhattan below 60th Street. People are afraid. There are beautiful office buildings there, and I guess the folks in the office buildings are a little concerned, but I don’t think they should be. With the right amount of police and sanitation, I think it could be a boon for New York. I’ve been going to ICSC Las Vegas every year for about 30 years, and I’ve never put a quarter in a machine. Some people are gamblers, and they enjoy it, and that’s fine, and some people just don’t find it interesting. I don’t think the whole world is going to turn to gambling just because they open a casino. Mark Hallum can be reached at mhallum@commercialobserver.com.

This growth will be fuelled by third-party cargo growth at new terminals over FY24-27E, followed by robust growth in JSW Group traffic FY27E onwards. This is based only on announced projects and there is significant optionality of new concessions given a) GoI’s aggressive port privatisation targets, b) management’s opportunistic approach, and c) its robust balance sheet. With a long residual concession life and strong growth visibility (given expansion plans of JSW Group), JSW Infra’s prem valuations look justified to us. Initiate with BUY rating. Initiate at BUY. JSW Infra’s FY27E val multiples prima facie look rich, at a premium to peers (Fig 49). We think this is justified given a) the significantly longer concession period, b) growth underpinned by expansions planned by group cos (esp post FY27E). We ascribe 18x to FY30E EBITDA and discount it back to arrive at our TP of Rs370/sh. Initiate with BUY. Pricol Ltd (Pricol): SACL Acquisition - growth at right valuations - Company Update CMP: Rs496; TP: Rs645; Rating: BUY ~ We raise our TP on Pricol to Rs645 (previously Rs580), as we account for earnings from the recent Sundaram Auto Components Ltd (SACL) acquisition and reiterate BUY. ~ This acquisition enables Pricol to focus on injection molding as a new vertical and has tremendous growth potential by virtue of new customer additions, courtesy well-established relationships in the legacy business. ~ We believe that the acquisition valuation (~12x FY24 PE ratio) is justified, given the presence of fast growing TVS Limited, relatively lower margins and its propulsion agnostic products. ~ The acquisition has led to an upgrade in the pre-acquisition earnings by 10% each in FY26/27E. ~ With 2w contributing ~65% to Pricol’s total revenues, robust demand in 2Ws presents a favorable outlook for the company to clock volume growth supported by a new portfolio of plastic components along with premiumization.

Title: Eighteen ways Palantir wants the Pentagon to change
URL: https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/12/eighteen-ways-palantir-wants-pentagon-change/401400/
Time Published: 2024-12-03T20:07:41Z
Full Content:
Shyam Sankar speaks at the AI Expo For National Competitiveness on May 7, 2024, in Washington, D.C. Tasos Katopodis / Getty Images for Palantir Stay Connected Lauren C. Williams The Defense Department is a sclerotic monopsony whose communist approach to acquisition has the United States on a precipice, writes Palantir’s chief technology officer, who prescribes a “painful” but “necessary” reformation based on competition and software. “I think we're just scratching the surface,” said Shyam Sankar, whose company calls itself the first software prime contractor. “The other huge opportunity is really on using AI to drive efficiencies,” including using technology to supplant human workers and processes that slow innovation and adoption. Sankar recently penned 18 theses that could reform how the Pentagon does business, in explicit comparison to Martin Luther’s criticisms of the Catholic Church. He highlights several well-documented problems often studied by congressionally mandated commissions—such as a belabored budgeting-and-planning process, the perils of requirements, and how cost-plus contracts remove incentives to innovate. The 18-page document also manages to say the quiet part out loud, demanding the Pentagon and Congress to change its practices with colorful curtness. One of Sankar’s main themes is the need for competition—whether it’s companies vying for Pentagon contracts or customers in the Defense Department looking for solutions. He also criticizes a system whose major suppliers sell only to the Pentagon and other militaries. “Chinese primes only earn 30-40% of their revenue from the PLA; the remainder is commercial. Those cheap products your neighbor is buying on Amazon are subsidizing lethality which could be used against our men and women in uniform, much the same way that during the Cold War your purchase of an American car, camera, and cereal subsidized America’s lethality against her enemies,” he wrote. Instead, Sankar writes, the Pentagon should vastly accelerate its purchases from largely commercial companies—like SpaceX, whose CEO Elon Musk has been tapped to lead a Trump administration government-efficiency drive. In September, Palantir’s stock joined the S&P 500, increasing software and tech companies’ share of the index. In recent weeks, Palantir’s market value of $137 billion edged out Lockheed Martin’s. Defense One spoke with Sankar. What are Palantir’s goals for 2025, especially amid a new administration? Our government business has re-accelerated dramatically. We're pretty excited about the product road maps that we've built. [Maven Smart System has] become the [Joint All Domain Command and Control] MVP. It's getting a huge amount of adoption, so we're pretty excited about that, and continue to invest in that. What defense areas will you expand into? I think we're just scratching the surface. So I mean, a big focus, obviously, Maven is at the pointy end of integrating AI into the kill chain. So how do you do that across all the services? It's coming down from OSD right now. The Army has started to adopt it…and the opportunities for that to happen with the [maritime operations centers] with the Navy and with the [air operations centers] with the Air Force, that are definitely top of mind. [We’re] continuing to push into space…we're at the very beginning of that. And then the other huge opportunity is really on using AI to drive efficiencies. There's more civilians in the DOD than there are uniformed service members. There are more acquisition professionals than there are Marines. And so have we just crushed ourselves with process? And I'm sure most of that process is needed, but can we use AI agents instead of humans to drive efficiency and speed through that? We've been able to automate the foreign-disclosure process, where it used to take humans three days to collect intelligence and then rewrite it to be releasable to partners, taking that down to three minutes. So the obvious benefit there is lethality and being able to share with allies and partners. But I think the other part of it is it just makes for a much leaner force. If you look at [Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology] report on Maven. With Maven, you can perform targeting operations with 20 people that used to take us 2,000 people in Iraq. So that sort of efficiency really drives the ability to hide in a pure conflict. You're much smaller, [there’s a] much smaller footprint, less support infrastructure, and [that] drives lethality. Would shrinking the Pentagon workforce, particularly on the civilian side, actually drive efficiency? It does in the U.S. commercial market every single day. We automated [an] insurance underwriting process where one of America's largest insurers, with 78 AI agents, took a process that used to take three weeks down to hours. We have this challenge in government, generally—it's not just the Department of Defense—where we view people as abundant, and technology is unaffordable and expensive. But that's the exact opposite of how the commercial world looks at technology. They view people as very expensive, and technology as cheap as the way of achieving efficiency and effectiveness. I think a lot of that is because of the monopsony. That's what really speaks to the heart of the “Defense Reformation.” Like, why do we have the system we have? Well, I don't envy the position of being the department; being the sole buyer for a thing is very hard. At some very fundamental level, you believe in free markets or you don't. And what we have is a centrally, unplanned process. So it's like the worst of communism, really: a central planning process is not actually planned. We have a [Future Years Defense Program] that takes five years, two years to do [program objection memorandum]—you can't really change your mind anywhere along there. You're gonna have unitary efforts: we have one F-35 for three services. I'm not sure we should have 30 years on $2 trillion. When we were building submarine-launched ballistic missiles under [Vice Adm. William] Raborn in the [1960s], we had four competing programs running concurrently. Today, we look at that and we say, ‘Oh, isn't that wasteful?’ But actually, CBO zone analysis shows that it was cheaper and faster because we had competition. And we've gotten too fixated, since the end of the Cold War, on how much competition is there in the industrial base. That's not actually the problem. The problem is there's not enough competition inside of government. Will Congress go along? Absolutely. I mean, I don't want to be too Pollyannaish about it, but I think Congress recognizes it’s part of the problem. I think what makes it really hard is they do have an actual oversight function to perform. So how do you balance the need for oversight with the necessary maneuver room that you're going to need when you're doing something innovative? That's just reality. If I think about all the projects in the company that I'm overseeing, I have to give folks the room to pivot, to change, to move. I think some of the recommendations coming out of the PPBE Commission are exactly right, like a capability element approach. Rather than a program-element approach, we're going to resource counter-UAS as a category and you're going to have the freedom and flexibility to move and adapt within that. If making a change, if changing your mind, if reacting to new data is major brain damage and requires things to go up and down the building up and down the Capitol Hill, you're not going to make changes, which means you're just going to accumulate error. Because the only thing you know for sure is that whatever plan you came up with yesterday is wrong today. The question is: can you fix it every single day as you observe that error, or can you just let all that error accumulate? And our five-year FYDP, our two-year POM—how we oversee these things is not fit for the moment. What do you most want the Pentagon and Congress to hear? The first one is that monopsony is the problem. You can look at your industrial base as a monopsonist. You get the industrial base you deserve. It really is all your fault. So you have to change your behaviors, what you're incentivizing and how you're organizing yourself to get what you need. Stop blaming the prime, stop thinking like some process is going to fix this. We need to approximate market forces as much as possible. “We need more competition inside of government” would be the pithy way of saying it. The second one is that cost-plus makes us dumber, poorer, and slower. The only two industries that do cost-plus are general contractors on remodels and the government. I don't know if you've done a remodel before, but are you happy with how that went and the price predictability and the timelines and stuff? It's just not the way to do these things. You've already lost by thinking about requirements to begin with. Share the problems with a competitive American market and let them come to you with solutions and then buy the best ones you like. Buy multiple if you want, but you're going to have to rely on the American industrial base, not the defense industrial base to provide compounding price performance. And you see that with the SpaceX example. It used to cost $50,000 per kilogram to get to orbit with the shuttle program. With Starship Heavy reuse, it's $10 to $20 per kilogram—not missing any zeros there. You can't get that with cost-plus, you can only get that because Elon [Musk] cares about getting to Mars. But ​​the DoD is kind of a unique customer. It has specific needs, like lethality and security. But that's really a response from our present world. Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, only 6 percent of [Pentagon spending on major weapons] went to defense primes. The rest went to dual-purpose companies. Chrysler built cars and missiles. Ford built satellites. Until 1990, General Mills, the cereal company, built torpedoes and artillery. So we had a very different American economy, where people were invested not only in economic prosperity, but also in freedom. And this is important, because commercial innovation drives price-performance improvements. You just can't see anywhere else. If you work at a car company in America and you're not able to decrease price for 4% a year, you're gonna get fired, you know. iIn the industrial base and the defense industrial base, if prices aren't increasing all the time, people would be shocked. So, like, the fundamental mechanisms are missing. And I think the reason we have what we have is that when we lost competition; when the Berlin Wall fell down, we didn't have a pure competitor anymore. The Soviets were basically done, and we went from 6 percent spending on unique defense primes to 86 percent today. It's not that I'm saying the products are dual-use, like missiles are single-use, but the companies are dual-purpose. I built the Operation Warp Speed supply chain for the U.S. government in two weeks because two years earlier, I had solved a structurally similar problem for BP and oil and gas production. Anything else? The most important thing is: “How did we get here?” We are in this state of undeclared emergency. We've lost deterrence as the West in the world, we've spent trillions of dollars. And how did we get here? My argument to you is really this: we went from spending 94% of our money on dual-purpose companies to creating a unique class of defense specialists that we put on the Galapagos Islands, and we created a great schism between commercial innovation and defense. And that has made our country much less safe, much less innovative. It's created many of these problems, and we did that because of the nature of monopsony. And the answer is to fix that. That's where it starts. NEXT STORY: Army aims to move its pay system to the cloud by 2027 Help us tailor content specifically for you:

Amazon Web Services (AMZN+1.11%) unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence training chip that it says is faster and expected to use less energy. Trainium3 is the first chip from AWS built with the 3-nanometer process — so far the most advanced semiconductor technology — that allows for better performance and power efficiency. The first Trainium3 chips are expected to be available late next year, AWS announced at its re:Invent conference on Tuesday. UltraServers powered with Trainium3 are expected to perform four times better than those powered by its Trainium2 chips, AWS said, “allowing customers to iterate even faster when building models and deliver superior real-time performance when deploying them.” The cloud giant’s Trainium2 chips, which are four times faster than its predecessor, are now generally available, AWS said. The Trainium2-powered Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances allow for 30% to 40% better price performance than current chips, and feature 16 Trainium2 chips. The new Amazon EC2 instances are “ideal for training and deploying LLMs with billions of parameters,” AWS said. The cloud giant said it is building an EC2 UltraCluster of Trainium2-powered UltraServers with AI startup Anthropic called Project Rainier. In November, AWS announced it was following up a previous $4 billion investment in the AI startup with another $4 billion. In the next phase of the partnership, Anthropic will use AWS as its primary AI training partner. “Trainium2 is purpose built to support the largest, most cutting-edge generative AI workloads, for both training and inference, and to deliver the best price performance on AWS,” David Brown, vice president of Compute and Networking at AWS, said in a statement. “With models approaching trillions of parameters, we understand customers also need a novel approach to train and run these massive workloads. New Trn2 UltraServers offer the fastest training and inference performance on AWS and help organizations of all sizes to train and deploy the world’s largest models faster and at a lower cost.” AWS chief executive Matt Garman also announced the next-generation P6 family of instances from Nvidia (NVDA-0.04%) and AWS, featuring the chipmaker’s new Blackwell chips. Blackwell has 2.5 times faster compute than current generation of graphics processing units, or GPUs, Garman said.

Title: Ex-Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger may get more than $10 million in severance pay
URL: https://qz.com/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-resign-millions-severance-pay-1851712248
Time Published: 2024-12-03T16:26:00Z

Outgoing Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is set to get paid as much as $10 million as he exits the struggling tech giant. Gelsinger will receive 18 months of his base annual salary of $1.25 million, or $1.8 million, and 1.5 times his target bonus of $3.4 million, or $5.16 million, which will be paid out over the next 18 months, Intel (INTC-5.26%) said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. Gelsinger will also receive a payment equal to 11/12ths of his 2024 bonus — which is subject to company performance — that he would have received had he not resigned. That would be a little more than $3 million. His departure comes as the chipmaker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors like Nvidia (NVDA-0.04%) in the artificial intelligence boom. In recent months, Intel has also been the subject of activist investor interest, including a potential takeover bid, as its performance has lagged. In early November, Intel was kicked out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average to make room for Nvidia, which has been hailed as an “AI darling.” Intel’s stock has fallen by more than 52% in 2024 as of Tuesday, while its rival’s stock has surged by more than 188%. Although Gelsinger’s resignation was announced Monday morning, it came after what CNBC reports was a contentious board meeting over a lack of confidence in the CEO’s plans to compete with Nvidia. Gelsinger had served as the company’s first chief technical officer before leaving the company. He returned in 2021 to take over for then-CEO Bob Swan in an attempt to stabilize and modernize the company. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,” Gelsinger said in a statement Monday. As the board searches for a new chief, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant named David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-CEOs. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board and its interim executive chair, said the pair will continue the company’s mission to simplify and strengthen Intel’s product portfolio and advance manufacturing and foundry capabilities while cutting costs. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,” he said.

Advancements to AI could play a key role in the gaming industry's future, Hermen Hulst says. By Eddie Makuch on December 3, 2024 at 8:45AM PST According to one of the top bosses at PlayStation, the rise in artificial intelligence technologies in game development has the potential to "revolutionize" gaming, but only as a tool that assists humans. "Striking the right balance between leveraging AI and preserving the human touch will be crucial," Hermen Hulst told the BBC. He went on to predict that the gaming industry will see a "dual demand," split between AI-driven "innovative experiences" and a second for "handcrafted, thoughtful content." There are concerns among industry developers about the potential for advancements to AI ending up taking jobs from humans. This is part of the reason why video game voice actors are now on strike and why some labor unions are calling on workers to organize. Another video game executive, Christoph Hartmann of Amazon, said he believes AI could replace "boring" parts of video game jobs, including localization as he sees it. However, Hartmann and others believe the rise in AI technologies will create enough new jobs to offset any potential job losses. EA's Andrew Wilson previously said the agricultural and industrial revolutions took many jobs but created countless more, and he sees an AI revolution following a similar playbook. The video game industry had another tough year in 2024 with thousands of worker layoffs, along with game cancellations and studio closures. A number of companies whose executives are speaking positively about AI--including Microsoft, EA, Amazon, and PlayStation--have all cut jobs in the past year. Whether or not these cuts were at all related to AI is unknown, however. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com Use your keyboard! Log in to comment

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks traded mixed on Tuesday as investors digested fresh jobs data and waited for new Fedspeak to cement or dent growing hopes for future interest rate cuts. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.1% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) hugged the flat line in late morning trade, coming off fresh records for the two gauges. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) reversed earlier gains to fall roughly 0.4%. Job openings rose by 372,000 to 7.74 million in October compared to estimates of 7.52 million, according to BLS data released on Tuesday. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed fewer hires were made during the month while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, rose to 2.1% from 1.9% in September. JOLTS serves as the first in a wave of key data this week that culminates in Friday's all-important monthly US payrolls report. Traders are now pricing in about a 69% chance that the Fed lowers rates by a quarter percentage point at its Dec. 18 meeting, compared with 62% a day ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Those odds could shift after Fed policymakers Austan Goolsbee and Adriana Kugler appear later on Tuesday, which set the stage for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's panel discussion on Wednesday. On the corporate front, Tesla (TSLA) stock slipped in early trading after shipments of the EV maker's China-built models fell again, putting sales targets in doubt. In addition, CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay deal was rejected again by a judge.

In a research note released to reporters on Monday, BofA's economics team led by Claudio Irigoyen projected the US economy will grow at an annualized rate of 2.4% in 2025, higher than current forecasts for 2% growth, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates. This comes despite uncertainties surrounding the economic policies of President-elect Donald Trump, including campaign promises of tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigration, which economists have viewed as inflationary. Higher rates, coupled with a hawkish tariff policy, would strengthen the US dollar and create spillover effects to global financial conditions, representing "a major shock, not only for the US economy but the rest of the world," according to BofA.

Title: Ex-Dividend Reminder: NVIDIA, Qualcomm And NXP Semiconductors

On 12/5/24, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and NXP Semiconductors will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. NVIDIA will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.01 on 12/27/24, Qualcomm will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.85 on 12/19/24, and NXP Semiconductors will pay its quarterly dividend of $1.014 on 1/8/25. Start slideshow: 10 Stocks Where Yields Got More Juicy » As a percentage of NVDA's recent stock price of $138.63, this dividend works out to approximately 0.01%, so look for shares of NVIDIA to trade 0.01% lower — all else being equal — when NVDA shares open for trading on 12/5/24. Similarly, investors should look for QCOM to open 0.52% lower in price and for NXPI to open 0.43% lower, all else being equal. Below are dividend history charts for NVDA, QCOM, and NXPI, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. NVIDIA: NVDA Qualcomm: QCOM NXP Semiconductors: NXPI In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 0.03% for NVIDIA, 2.09% for Qualcomm, and 1.74% for NXP Semiconductors. Free Report: Top 8%+ Dividends (paid monthly) In Tuesday trading, NVIDIA shares are currently up about 0.3%, Qualcomm shares are up about 2.8%, and NXP Semiconductors shares are up about 1.9% on the day.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks drifted near all-time highs on Tuesday as investors waited for fresh jobs data and Fedspeak to cement or dent growing hopes for future interest rate cuts. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) hugged the flatline, coming off fresh records for the two gauges. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ticked up about 0.1%. Investors are bracing for a reading later on JOLTS job openings in October, the first in a wave of key data this week that culminates in Friday's all-important monthly US payrolls report. The watch is on for signs of a soft landing for the economy, which will shape views on the path of rates — especially after Federal Reserve officials hinted that they're still open to a December cut. Traders are now pricing in about a 73% chance that the Fed lowers rates by a quarter percentage point at its Dec. 18 meeting, compared with 62% a day ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Those odds could shift after appearances by Fed policymakers Austan Goolsbee and Adriana Kugler later Tuesday, which set the stage for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's panel discussion on Wednesday. On the corporate front, Tesla (TSLA) stock slipped in early trading after shipments of the EV maker's China-built models fell again, putting sales targets in doubt. In addition, CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay deal was rejected again by a judge. Meanwhile, shares in US Steel (X) fell about 8% on the heels of President-elect Donald Trump's promise to "block" its $15 billion takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel (5401.T, NPSCY). Trump said tax incentives and tariffs will enable the American steel giant to thrive on its own. Political turmoil in France is also attracting market attention, with the government on the brink of collapse as its faces a parliamentary vote. With Germany also set for a snap election after a government breakdown, Wall Street is keeping a close eye on the two pillars of the EU.

This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Cyber Monday may be over, but the deals are still going strong—for now. Whether you're checking off your holiday shopping or snagging a special treat for yourself, now's the time to pounce. Every item on this list has been vetted, tested, and loved by someone at WIRED. Our Gear team has cross-checked these picks with our buying guides to ensure you're getting the lowest prices—or close to it. Don't wait too long, though. These prices won't stick around forever—some may already expire by the time you reach the end of this story. Jump to Category Our Process We test products year-round and handpicked these deals. To find you the best deals, we use a proprietary tool that scans prices on everything we've reviewed over the last two years and spotlights notable price changes. We then pore over massive spreadsheets by hand and pick the best of the best deals. Samsung's S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best TVs you can buy right now, offering vivid yet naturalistic colors, class-leading brightness, and near-infinite contrast and perfect black levels that make OLED TVs so gobsmacking to gaze at. Outside its stellar performance, you’ll get a loaded suite of gaming features, including four HDMI 2.1 inputs for advanced gameplay, a dedicated game bar, and Samsung's Game Hub to stream from services like Xbox Game Pass. The one notable drawback for all Samsung TVs is their lack of Dolby Vision HDR, which is more prevalent than Samsung’s dynamic alternative, HDR10+. Even so, I’d happily have this stylish beauty as my primary display, offering picture quality that’s among the best I’ve seen all year at its best price yet. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s Bravia 9 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-performing backlit TV around. It blends next-gen brightness with Sony’s proprietary dimming and picture processing to provide stunningly balanced performance across the board. The TV’s brightness pushes toward the psychedelic when called upon, but with measured dispersal to keep from blowing your eyeballs out. On the other end, you’ll experience OLED-like black levels and contrast, and 4K detail that pops off the screen. Sony only offers two HDMI 2.1 ports, meaning you’re losing two slots for gaming consoles over competitors, and the TV’s off-axis viewing is good, not great. That’s the price you’ll pay for brilliance that outdoes even the most fiery OLED displays. If you’ve been looking for a good sale on the best LED TV out there, your search is over. —Ryan Waniata The price of Sony’s impressive Bravia 7 TV (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has sunk like a stone. I took points off the score for its poor off-axis performance, but if you’re watching mostly from straight on, this TV rocks. You’ll get stunning clarity and detail, excellent brightness, vibrant quantum dot colors, and deep black levels thanks to the same algorithm that helps Sony’s Bravia 9 TV look so good. Like all of Sony’s premium TVs, the Bravia 7 offers only two HDMI 2.1 ports, limiting your options for high-performance gaming when compared to some of the best TVs in its class. Otherwise, this is a sweet screen for hundreds less than its inflated launch price. —Ryan Waniata Hisense's 65-inch U7N QLED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our choice as the best TV for most people right now, thanks to its impressive performance and features for the money. The TV’s swarm of mini LED backlights serve up fiery brightness and deep black levels with minimal light bleed, meaning the picture looks great in the daylight and the dark. It’s got great gaming features, including VRR (variable refresh rate) for gaming at up to 144 kHz from its high-refresh panel, and an intuitive Google TV smart system to run the show. Videophiles will likely notice some dirty screen effect—this is a value model after all—and like nearly all backlit TVs, its off-axis viewing is just OK. Still, there’s little to complain about in this well-balanced package, serving up big 4K thrills at a crazy-low price. —Ryan Waniata If you’re after a solid screen at a sweet price, Roku’s baseline Plus Series could be right up your alley. It all starts with the fantastic Roku operating system that makes it remarkably simple to call up connected devices, grab any app, and even track down your remote with a built-in chime. Frankly, that last feature is so fundamental I can’t believe it isn’t standard in all modern TVs. The Plus Series’ panel only offers a 60-Hz refresh rate, so it’s not the best option for serious gamers, but it’s a solid performer thanks to good brightness and punchy colors. Thanks to local dimming, you won’t see blotchy patches when the lights are down, either. Support for Apple Homekit, Alexa, and Google Assistant rounds out the package for a great budget buy. —Ryan Waniata For those looking to see the blaze of summer in the dead of winter, Hisense’s 65-inch U8N TV serves up stunning brightness that nearly doubles many TVs in its price class. All that power doesn’t come at the cost of contrast, as the TV provides excellent black levels with minimal light bleed, alongside vivid quantum dot colors to let you bask in its sizzling punch in any lighting. You’ll also get the latest gaming features, a breezy Google TV interface, and every major flavor of HDR. The off-axis viewing isn’t anything to write home about, but this TV feels more premium than it has a right to for under $1,000. Looking to go bigger? The 75-inch version is still reasonable at $1,300, or you can go nuclear with the 85-incher for $300 more. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Apple’s latest iPad Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with several internal upgrades. With an A17 Pro chip, it can handle both graphically demanding games and Apple Intelligence (the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features) with ease. It also has support for the feature-packed Apple Pencil Pro. All of this is packed into a tiny build that’s great for traveling with—whether you’re using it for gaming or reading ebooks. —Brenda Stolyar This is the latest Apple Pencil to join the lineup. Unlike the 1st and 2nd-gen versions, it comes with a “squeeze” capability that triggers the tool palette (you can use double-tap as well) and a haptic engine that delivers feedback when you squeeze the stylus. The built-in gyroscope sensor also allows you to change the orientation of each tool as you twist it, giving you finer control. It’s only compatible with the iPad Air (M2), iPad Pro (M4), and iPad Mini (A17 Pro). —Brenda Stolyar The iMac with M4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a few notable upgrades, including a 12-megapixel webcam with support for Center Stage, the option to add a nano-texture display, and the accessories now come with USB-C ports. Powered by the latest M4 chip, it delivers great performance too. It’s currently our favorite desktop in our guide to Best All-in-One Computers. —Brenda Stolyar This MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) with M1 is the cheapest MacBook you can buy. Although the M1 came out back in 2020, it’s still a speedy and capable chip for simple tasks and basic activities (like web browsing, sending emails, and word processing) along with light video editing. It also has solid battery life and will easily last you an entire day. It’s a good option if you’re looking for a reliable MacBook without breaking the bank. —Brenda Stolyar Apple recently launched the M4-powered versions of the MacBook Pro, but the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains a great option. It has a bright display with mini-LED and a 1080p webcam built in. You’ll also get a 120-Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling. As usual, it packs plenty of ports, including two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4, an HDMI, a MagSafe charging port, an SD card slot, and a high-impedance headphone jack. We recommend it if you don’t want to spend over $2,000 on a MacBook Pro. —Brenda Stolyar This is one of our top picks in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. The low-profile keys are satisfying to type on, while the slim and lightweight build is easy to travel with for those who like to take their peripherals on the go. It mimics the MacBook keyboard too, complete with a Do Not Disturb key and the option to program the function row key with Apple’s own apps like Keynote, Final Cut Pro, Safari, and more. It’s only available with tactile quiet switches, though. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite keyboard case for iPads. The first half protects the back of the iPad and also comes with a kickstand while the second half has a detachable keyboard and trackpad. The case is not only durable and sturdy but also feels great to type on. Instead of Bluetooth, it connects using Apple’s Smart Connector so you don’t have to worry about draining battery life. It’s available for the base iPad (7th, 8th, and 9th Gen) along with the iPad Air (5th Gen and M2) and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st Gen and newer), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (5th and 6th Gen), as well as the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro with M4. —Brenda Stolyar Logitech's Casa Pop-Up Desk (9/10, WIRED Review) is a great solution for those who constantly work on the go but prefer using an external keyboard and mouse with your laptop. Instead of carrying all those accessories around, the Casa Pop-Up Desk includes a keyboard and trackpad that fit neatly into a compact case that doubles as a laptop stand. It’s expensive, but it’s worth it if you’re always working out of the house. —Brenda Stolyar This is a great accessory if you want to use your iPhone as a webcam. Thanks to a feature called Continuity Camera, you can use your iPhone as a webcam for a MacBook (you can check out these instructions for how to set it up). The circular silicone puck magnetically connects to your iPhone (it also doubles as a kickstand or phone grip), and there’s a section that pops out so you can mount the iPhone on top of a MacBook. Since it utilizes the rear camera, the Belkin allows for a more natural video-calling experience and better image quality than the standard MacBook webcam. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This Bluetooth-connected portable board finally got my 7- and 9-year-old interested in chess. The pieces feel wonderfully matte and heavy to play with. It connects to the GoChess app on your phone, which is integrated with Lichess and Chess.com. You can play against other people or get AI-enabled suggestions in person, and the board lights up to guide you. My kids will pick up pieces and discuss moves for hours. It's great.—Adrienne So A firm WIRED favorite and one of the best family board games, Ticket to Ride features steam engine styling and rules that are easy to grasp. All you must do is claim railway routes across the US and Canada using your colorful plastic rail cars. Spend cards to claim routes, rack up bonus points for connecting specific destinations, and the person with the highest score at the end wins. All aboard, choo, choo! —Simon Hill If your kid is learning how to ride a bike, a Guardian bike is not that much more expensive than a big box store bike, and it weighs around 10 pounds less. Guardian's proprietary SureStop brake system which means the rear wheel will always brake before the front wheel, so your kid will never flip over. It works. I gave my kid's bike to a 20-year-old ding-dong to test in an empty parking garage, and he couldn't flip it.—Adrienne So Inspired by the Royal Palace of Evora in Portugal, with its Moorish blue-and-white ceramic tiles, this board game challenges you to make mosaics by matching tiles with different patterns and colors to amass the maximum possible score. One of the best family board games for all tastes, Azul is easy to grasp but supports many tactical approaches and has surprising depth. The beautiful tiles and other components are high quality, and filling your board is deeply satisfying. Play moves quickly, and you can complete a game in less than an hour, but you will probably want to play again immediately. —Simon Hill Start with a randomly generated map of hexagonal tiles in this addictive family board game, and gather and trade resources to develop your civilization and win. Amassing enough victory points requires a smart strategy and some dice-rolling luck. Catan is easy to get the hang of and only takes around an hour to finish. Players can trade freely, but the robber mechanic can cause arguments, so set some ground rules. The modular randomization makes for excellent replay value, and there are expansions and spin-offs to further complicate the gameplay. This game is for three or four players aged 10 years and up. —Simon Hill This cat-themed card game is easy to pick up and perfect for a quick game. The aim is to avoid exploding kitten cards by wielding a comical cast of cats with special powers. Timing and strategy are essential to get the best of your opponents. This fun card game appears in our best family board games guide. If it’s a hit with your fam, there are countless expansion packs worth trying. —Simon Hill One of the best family board games for larger groups, Herd Mentality is all about writing down the same answer as everyone else. If you agree with the majority of players on the best pizza topping, Disney movie, or the smallest animal that could carry your weight, you win a cow token. Eight tokens win you the game, but if you are the odd one out, you get the pink cow of doom. It’s funny and easy to play with any group. —Simon Hill I’m going to be honest with you: I hate these blinky, twinkly, one-trick-pony toys because my kids play with them for a week or two and then put them away forever. (Give them sets or skills they can build on, like games, Lego, or instruments.) Nevertheless, I make an exception because Sphero’s toys are so delightful and this price is ridiculous. My colleague Simon Hill’s wife uses this coding ball as a classroom aid to teach basic coding skills to 9-year-olds and older. It’s adorable and can move and navigate mazes through infrared communication. —Adrienne So Loog Guitars is holding a sitewide sale for 40 percent off that ends tonight. This is cheating a bit, because my kids already know how to play piano and violin, but the Loog electric guitar is the fastest I've ever seen them pick up an instrument. The app is fun and engaging and my son even tuned it himself. (It's also an excuse to get on the iPad, grrr.) —Adrienne So This rock tumbler is perfect for any aspiring rock hound, and we say as much in our STEM toys buying guide. The kit includes four levels of grit, plus a bag of rough gemstones so they can get started tumbling during Christmas break. According to the Amazon reviews, this tumbler is also used and liked by some adults who've been putting rocks in their pockets for decades. —Adrienne So This stylish Lego set is from the botanicals collection, and can be loved by Lego fans and interior design fans alike. It’s a fun set to build with a person, too, since it’s built in two near-identical halves that you and someone else can make at the same time and then connect together. The finished piece has lived everywhere from my entryway to my dining room table to various shelves, and it’s looked good in every single spot. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you use Samsung devices, this is a great triple wireless charger for your Galaxy phone, Galaxy smartwatch, and Galaxy earbuds. Since it’s Qi-compatible, you can also use it to charge other devices as well—including iPhones. It also has LEDs that light up quickly when you place your gadgets down on it, and it also comes with a 25-watt wall charger and USB-C cable. However, it doesn’t work with all Galaxy watches. We found that it was, however, compatible with the Watch4 and older Watch3. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite MagSafe dash mount for the iPhone 12 or later. You can attach it via dashboard pad or windshield with a suction cup—both of which proved secure in our testing. There’s also a telescopic arm that combines with a ball joint for a wide range of movement, allowing you to find the ideal position. The USB-C charging cable is removable too, so you can store it when it’s not in use. There’s also a built-in fan to help keep you cool when it gets hot outside. Our only gripe is that it tops out at 7.5 watts for charging. —Brenda Stolyar Durable and versatile, this power bank slips easily into a bag and has a nice grippy, textured finish. The yellow is easy to spot in a crowded tent, and the segmented LED shows the remaining power in blocks of 10 percent. The Charge 100 Max can charge up to five gadgets at once, and the wireless charging pad on top is handy in the dark when you don’t want to fumble with cables. This is the outdoors pick in our Best Portable Chargers guide. —Simon Hill We particularly love Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro for its compact design and support for 15-watt wireless charging. The prongs also cling to your vent securely and the array of magnets allow for a strong hold with MagSafe-enabled iPhones. With a ball joint, you can also angle your phone slightly for a better view of the screen. Unfortunately, the USB-C cable is permanently attached. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top 3-in-1 wireless charger if you want to utilize Apple’s StandBy Mode. Introduced with iOS 17, it turns your iPhone into a smart display. With Twelve South’s charger, you can place it in landscape mode to trigger the feature while also simultaneously charging two other devices on the base such as your Apple Watch or AirPods. —Brenda Stolyar Belkin’s Stand Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with DockKit integration, which means it can use the iPhone’s camera to track your face while the 360-degree base automatically moves around to keep you in frame. It’s great for those who FaceTime a lot and find themselves searching for objects to prop the phone on. It’s also an excellent accessory for content creators who want to record hands-free video on the go. With a built-in battery, you don’t need to worry about being near a power source either. But with support for MagSafe, you can also use it as a charger. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The best air fryers help you cook quickly and potentially with less fat or oil. These compact convection ovens heat up fast to make crispy chicken, fries, and donuts. This Cosori model is our favorite smart air fryer because you can remotely control it using a smartphone or tablet (it also has a digital control panel). We like the slick, black, classy design. The cooking drawer has a smooth action, and the handle stays cool, though the sides can get hot, so it needs plenty of space. Temperature options range from 175 degrees Fahrenheit to a powerful 400, with 12 handy preset cooking modes. —Simon Hill The Typhur dome air fryer cooks with blazing speed and has a modern round shape that I enjoyed in my testing. It’s easy to clean and has intuitive controls. —Martin Cizmar I love Cync's smart light bulbs, but the lights I use most by Cync are now the Undercabinet Pick Lights. They're easy to install under your cabinets, and easy to control over the app or a smart speaker. These undercabinet lights can do a variety of shades of whites, colors, and even fun effects that Cync calls Light Shows (my favorite is the candle option for moody fall lighting). They're usually $85, so getting three pucks to put under your kitchen cabinets is a nice discount. I used four pucks for four cabinets, two on either side of my cabinets around my oven, so I recommend at least two packs if you have cabinets split up by an oven. —Nena Farrell The Nutribullet Ultra is one of the best blenders we’ve tested. It’s stylish and has simple controls, and the 1,200-watt motor is powerful enough to handle all your smoothies, dips, and sauces. The 30-second blend is usually enough to get through your ingredients, but you might have to run a second cycle if you want the smoothest consistencies. The five-year warranty and suction cup feet are icing on the cake. Er, smoothie. We’ve seen this blender drop to $90 before, but anything below $110 is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe If you don't want to spring for the Thermapen above, the ThermoPop is a great budget option. It's not as fast, but it's still fast and the large, back-lit, auto-rotating screen is easy to read. It's waterproof, and accurate to plus or minus one degree. —Scott Gilbertson Instant-read thermometers are a kitchen essential. Can you prod your steak with a finger and accurately temp it? I think not. The Thermapen One will tell you the exact internal temperature in one second; no need for elaborate guesswork. Cheap instant-read thermometers litter Amazon, but we like the more expensive Thermapen One for its reliability and speed. The speed is important because the longer that oven door is open, the more unevenly you end up cooking. At this price, why not get the best? —Scott Gilbertson For those who want an air fryer but don’t want to devote the hefty counter space to a full-sized device, the WIRED Gear team’s favorite compact model is this nifty little Ninja, which is clocking in at a hefty discount. The cooker is still quite versatile for a wee thing, with settings that include max crisp, air fry, air roast, air broil, bake, reheat, and dehydrate. Our tester even managed to successfully bake a little chocolate cake. —Matthew Korfhage If you’ve been meaning to cut down on single-use plastics, now’s your chance. We love Stasher’s silicone bags, which are reusable and versatile, whether you’re meal prepping, storing leftovers, or cooking sous vide (7/10, WIRED Recommends). They’re dishwasher and microwave-safe, leakproof, and designed to last through thousands of uses. At $9, it’s a small price to pay for a sustainable swap you’ll use daily. —Boutayna Chokrane This excellent blender is durable and powerful. It’s got a generous 8-cup capacity and 10 blend settings. It gets pretty loud on the fastest setting, but our tester’s hummus was smooth in 30 seconds. The Braun has a touchscreen with several preset modes for things like smoothies, soups, spreads, frozen desserts, and more. The jar is made of Tritan, a type of impact-resistant plastic, rather than glass, but if that doesn’t bother you, this is a good deal on a reliable model. —Louryn Strampe We’ve tested a lot of food processors, and this model from KitchenAid is the very best we’ve tried. It comes in four colors and has a solid 9-cup capacity which has enough room to make servings for a family of four. The blades and discs can be stored in the bowl and the base has storage for the cord. You’ll get a multipurpose blade, a dough blade, a slicing disc, a julienne disc, and a whisk accessory. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked. —Louryn Strampe The Enso is the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall soda maker: durable, simple, sturdy, easy to use, and so intuitive you can make soda with one hand while skimming the news with your phone. If you use the HOLIDAY40 code on SodaStream’s website, it’s 40 percent off. —Matthew Korfhage This egg cooker fluctuates in price all the time, but this is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen it. It’s featured in our “Buy It for Life” guide. WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu says his wife loves this little countertop appliance, which can cook eggs in a myriad of different ways. Poach, soft-boil, hard-boil, or even whip up an omelet. It’ll chime to let you know when breakfast is served. It’s available in several cute colors like aqua, powder blue, and red. —Louryn Strampe How is a coffee warmer smart? Hint: It’s not because it uploads your habits to a cloud server. It’s smart because it turns itself on when you put a flat-bottomed coffee mug on top of it, and keeps your coffee warm at about 130 degrees. And it turns itself off when you remove the mug. So your coffee stays warm, and you don’t have to think about it. It makes for a great gift to anyone who likes, you know, warm beverages. —Matthew Korfhage Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals There has never been a better time to buy a robot vacuum. Even as the technology advances by leaps and bounds, many older models remain perfectly capable—and sometimes more than grand cheaper. The Q5 Pro+ has now been supplanted by Roborock’s Qrevo line, but this was our top pick for over a year and Roborock vacuums age well. I have a 6-year-old Roborock on the upper story of my house that is still going strong. —Adrienne So Dyson's V12 Detect Slim (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Dyson vacuum if you have a small space, like a studio apartment or one-bedroom. It’s compact and lightweight, weighing only five pounds and just four feet long, and it’s perfect for both stashing in a small space and for vacuuming just a room or two since it has a run time of up to 60 minutes. It also comes with a variety of attachments. All and all, it’s pretty powerful for such a compact size. —Nena Farrell The Gen5Detect is one of the latest vacuums in Dyson’s lineup. The company swapped the trigger for a single power button and the Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head now shoots out a laser that’s twice as bright. It packs the fastest motor yet, too, spinning at 135,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) with a suction power of 265 air watts (AW). Dyson added a HEPA filter as well, which Dyson says traps 99.99 percent of particles down to 0.1 microns. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite budget vacuum in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. A couple of years ago, the company updated the Motorbar Cleaner with its hair-detangling technology and hair screw tool. It has improved filtration too, with the ability to trap 99.99 percent of fine dust. This vacuum also converts into a hand vac, so you don’t have to buy a separate one. The battery should also last up to 40 minutes and takes about 5.5 hours to fully charge. If you're purchasing the vacuum from Kohl's, it's worth noting the sale ends at midnight. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top pick in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. It’s lightweight (at under 7 pounds), so it’s super easy to maneuver. My favorite feature is the green laser that shoots out of the front of the motorized head to help illuminate microscopic dust particles. There’s also a sensor built into the vacuum that counts the number and size of dust particles it’s sucking up. You can see the data on the LCD in real time. As for battery life, you’ll get a 60-minute run time while the battery itself takes up to 4.5 hours to charge. It’s pricey, but the features and performance are worth it. —Brenda Stolyar If you’re not interested in one of Dyson’s standard vacuums, you can opt for a robot vacuum instead. With a spin speed of 110,000 RPM, this one is super powerful. It also has a digital display and a filter that’s easy to remove and clean. According to Dyson, it also has six times more suction than the competition. It also comes equipped with a “triple-action” brush bar, which includes soft nylon for large debris on hard floors, antistatic carbon-fiber filaments for fine dust, and stiff nylon bristles for carpet. —Brenda Stolyar Top of our best carpet cleaners guide, this vacuum did an excellent job removing cat hair and lingering odors. It’s easy to use, comes with two removable tanks, and has a special spray jet to target stains. Fill the top tank to the marked lines with warm water and detergent, pull a trigger on the handle to wet wash, and then run over the area slowly and watch the bottom tank fill with dirty water. You can choose from three modes (Max, Deep, and Express), and it comes with multiple attachments, including one for upholstery and another for stairs. —Simon Hill Shark’s AI Ultra 2-in-1 mopping vacuum earned a “Most Improved Award” from me in 2022; the company recently replaced it with the Matrix. Shark’s products can be hit or miss, but happily I liked the Matrix very much. It has multifunctional vacuuming and mopping and is pretty reliable. It doesn’t need replacement dust bags—which is both a blessing and a curse, as the self-emptying dustbin sometimes doesn’t empty quite all the way. —Adrienne So The PetSafe ScoopFree SmartSpin Self-Cleaning Litter Box is around half the price of other popular (and expensive) automatic litter box models, and has a similar design. This futuristic-looking pod on legs has a weight detector that sets off the cleaning cycle a few minutes after your cat has gone to the bathroom, and has a slide-out tray in the bottom. It’s also connected to an app so that you review your cat’s toilet visits, where each entry displays the time they went, their weight, and trip duration. This box works surprisingly well and is a cheap alternative if you really hate taking out the litter but don’t want to shell out the big bucks. —Molly Higgins Like all of the Petlibro products I tested for my Automatic Pet Feeder guide, the One RFID Smart Feeder is a super-techy and sleek cat product. For this feeder, the pet wears a collar with a tag in which the feeder’s lid opens and retracts over the kibble when the cat approaches or leaves, ensuring that only the chosen pet with the collar can access the food. In my review, I called this “a nearly perfect device for a particular kind of pet owner.” I think this feeder would work best for a cat in a dog home, if one particular cat has special dietary needs, or if you have a multi-cat home with an aggressive eater. At only a little over 100 bucks, this would be a good time to snag and see if this product would work well for your pet. —Molly Higgins Petlibro’s Polar Wet Food Feeder is a smart little invention and first of its kind in the Automatic Pet Feeder realm—it’s basically a minifridge that operates via the app to deliver wet food that can be safely stored for up to 3 days. You can customize feeding schedules via the app and the Polar even shuts off cooling 30 minutes before feeding to make sure the food is not too cold if your cat is as picky as mine. I already have one at home, but at a great value for less than a hundred bucks right now ($80), I’m ordering a second one for my other cat. Gone are the days of them screeching for a can of wet food at 5 am. —Molly Higgins The best smart Christmas lights you can buy are on sale. Perfect timing if you need to upgrade. Easy to set up, with a black or green cord that blends nicely into the tree, Twinly’s lights support all kinds of colors and animated effects via the app, and you can also make custom effects. You can design based on an existing pattern, draw with your fingers, or even upload a GIF. Draped on a tree, the lights are best with gradient and stripe-style patterns, like the candy cane stripe effect. —Simon Hill One of the cheapest and best Govee smart lights you can buy is this affordable light strip that comes in several lengths. It is designed to be hidden behind furniture, so you just see the reflected light. We are highlighting the longest 100-foot option here, but all are segmented to display multiple colors, can be controlled wirelessly from the app or using voice controls, and support Govee’s enormous variety of lighting effects. These light strips also appear in our best smart lighting guide. —Simon Hill Nanoleaf makes fantastic wall light panels that double as light and home decor. The brand is famous for the hexagon sets, but Nanoleaf has expanded into other shapes, including triangles and light strips and even ceiling panels, in the past several years. This seven-pack of Nanoleaf Shapes Triangles is a fun size to use around the TV, in your office, or on any wall that could use a little fun added to it. It's a solid sale price, too, making it a good time to buy. —Nena Farrell If you’re looking for a great sunrise alarm clock for the price, you can’t do better than the Philips SmartSleep Wake-Up Light, especially now that it’s on sale. It’s a great little lamp that gets plenty bright to help you rise, and is easy to use and set up, too. It doesn’t have any nighttime routine options, but if you aren’t worried about those, this is a great purchase. —Nena Farrell If you're interested in light panels for your walls but want ones that will look just as nice when they're off as when they're turned on, Nanoleaf's Elements are a great choice. They’re our pick in the Best Nanoleaf Smart Lights for infrequent use since they have a wood finish, so you'll gain a more natural style statement when they’re turned off. These lights only glow in shades of white, so you’ll lose out on the rainbow aspect. Still, it's a nice trade-off, and you can get these on sale for almost $100 off right now. —Nena Farrell I'm not surprised this frame is on sale—Skylight just launched a new version earlier this fall, and it's fantastic, allowing you to switch out the frame style at will. This original model is still a solid digital photo frame, and it’s the best sale price you’ll find right now on digital photo frames. —Nena Farrell OK, we know you know about Ember’s temperature-controlled mugs, but Ohom’s is a whole different—and much simpler—beast. It’s not overengineered; you don’t have to connect it to your phone, check an app, and get constant phone pings. Instead, it looks and feels exactly like your favorite ceramic mug and the set keeps your coffee at the temperature you want to drink. That’s it! The heating pad also works as a charging pad! Just don’t put the mug in the microwave (which you shouldn’t anyway, because that makes coffee taste gross) and you’re good to go. —Adrienne So I’ve had this boxy model in my kitchen for over two years now to mitigate some of the combustion particulates from my gas stove, and this is one of the best sales for it I’ve seen. I especially appreciate that its HEPA replacement filters are both easy to find and inexpensive (Amazon has them for $26 for two). WIRED contributor Lisa Wood Shapiro also notes in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers that it has an excellent air exchange rate for small rooms, cleaning the air in 361 square feet at the recommended rate of 4.8 times per hour. —Kat Merck The Airmega 250 from clean air leader Coway provides the industrial vibe your home or loft needs. The warm gray box looks like a high-end speaker. And the Airmega 250 can do four air exchanges an hour when fitted for a 465-square-foot room. Utilizing a HEPA filter, this CARB-certified air purifier also has a washable prefilter along with an activated carbon filter to capture odors and VOCs. It has a built-in air quality sensor with indicator light and an easy-to-use control panel. It’s not app-compatible but does have a three-year warranty and runs at a relatively quiet 22 decibels. —Lisa Wood Shapir It takes a special screwdriver to deal with the soft, tiny, often infuriating screws that manufacturers love to use on anything from laptops to eyeglasses to remote controls–and these tiny screws often gatekeep simple repairs. Our Gear team’s testers haven’t been too impressed with multi-tools for screwdrivers this small. Get a good, tiny set like this Wiha 7-in-1 instead. —Matthew Korfhage The “super plush” name is true to the core. This super-soft robe is what I grab after every shower—my towel just has hair duty these days. It's a cozy robe that can dry you off while you're doing your hair, and it dries nicely for my next shower. If I were shopping for a new one, I'd jump for one of the cute striped options. Brooklinen often runs sales, but 25 percent off this robe is better than you'll usually find. —Nena Farrell This Arlo model has everything you need in an indoor security camera, including crisp 2K video at 24 frames per second, two-way audio, and a compact design that includes a privacy shutter. You can expect a quick loading feed in the Arlo app, useful smart notifications, and two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face if your phone allows. Sadly, you need a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This is the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide. —Simon Hill While it’s not our top pick, Google’s Nest Cam does make our list of the best outdoor security cameras and is a solid choice if you have a Nest Doorbell or other Google gadgets. The HD resolution is limited, but that’s offset by the HDR and high frame rate, and the face recognition is the best we have tested in a security camera. The Nest Aware subscription at $8 a month ($80/year) is too much if you only have a single camera, but that price covers multiple devices. —Simon Hill I love my Reolink doorbell, which does everything I need it to without the hassles of a glitchy app that needs to be updated every two weeks or any monthly fee. Don’t take my word for it, though: When my curling club needed a security system, another club member, who installs security cameras professionally, suggested we skip pricier options and just do a Reolink system. We’ve got an Reolink Altas PT Ultra (on sale for $160, which is $70 off) running inside over the bar and a solar-powered REOLINK Argus 4 Pro (on sale for $140 which is $80 off) running in the parking lot, which has drawn rave reviews based on the low cost (curling is a Scottish sport and thriftiness is part of the culture) and the fact that the whole leadership structure can access the footage from their phones via the Home Hub ($99). —Martin Cizmar These affordable Govee Wi-Fi Water Sensors are quick and easy to install, and send alerts as push notifications and emails to warn you when there’s a leak. With a very loud siren (100 decibels) you will hear them if you are home, and you can shut off the sound from the app. The sensors are compact with drip detection on top and metal feet for leak detection beneath. Alerts triggered within a few seconds in my tests, earning them a place in our best water leak detectors guide. The app is basic but works well and gives you an alert history. They do require a Govee Wi-Fi hub (included), which needs a power outlet, and it’s big enough that it may block an adjacent outlet. Each sensor also needs two AA batteries (provided). —Simon Hill Mattresses are frequently advertised with inflated discounts, and this mattress from Nectar was only $100 more than this earlier in November. However, it’s still a big discount on an all-foam mattress that’s solidly on the soft side despite being advertised as “medium firm.” —Martin Cizmar The original millennial bed-in-a-box has been sold a few times in recent years and recently went through a full-line redesign. I was impressed with the new Casper baseline mattress during my week of testing, as it retains a classic memory foam feel but is more firm and supportive than many competitors. We originally linked the queen version but it's not available, other sizes are. —Martin Cizmar Brooklinen's Cyber Monday sale ends on Tuesday night, with 25 percent off the entire site and up to 50 percent off bundles. There are a ton of great sheets worth shopping there, from the linen to the sateen, but Brooklinen's percale is my favorite of their sheet options. It's a nice crisp sheet and has an organic option (on sale for $172) that's a touch softer than the regular version. Both the organic and the classic percale sets are on sale right now for 25 percent off. —Nena Farrell Cozy Earth's Bamboo Sheet Set has been on the top of our Best Sheets guide ever since we started testing sheets, and it’s a star of our new Best Bamboo Sheets guide, too. These sheets, made with bamboo viscose, feel insanely soft and downright chilly to the touch before warming up like melted butter around you as you sleep. It's a downright decadent sheet set that's usually a splurge, which is why Cozy Earth's sale is the perfect time to shop. —Nena Farrell I've tried a lot of wearable breast pumps. They're supremely handy to use, but the Medela Freestyle (7/10, WIRED Recommends) will always be a favorite of mine because it was the most lightweight and had the least amount of parts to clean. And if you pump often, or even just once a day, having less cleaning to do feels like a lifesaver. The motor is in the handheld controller that you can pop in your pocket rather than weighing down your bra. It's comfortable, handy, and on sale for a great price compared to what you'll usually find it for. —Nena Farrell This handy little drill is a home tool kit essential. It’s got enough power to handle tasks that need extra torque, and the half-inch chuck will accept basically every drill bit size. This kit includes two batteries and a charger, and the batteries are also compatible with other DeWalt tools. This deal comes within $10 of the best we’ve seen. If you need bits, we recommend this kit, which is also on sale. —Louryn Strampe This inexpensive kit is full of our favorite drill bits. The black oxide coating both reduces friction and resists rust, and the drill bits can handle wood, metal, plastics, wallboard, and fiberglass. These go on sale frequently, but this is still a good get, especially if you’re picking up the discounted DeWalt drill that we also recommend. —Louryn Strampe Luxome's bamboo sheets are the best bamboo sheets you can buy, with fantastic quality made from bamboo viscose (which is better than bamboo rayon!), tons of gorgeous colors from which to choose, a fantastically silky-soft feel, and a good price point. Luxome is hosting its only sale of the year right now, so you can get these amazing sheets for even cheaper than usual. The white color has an extra $5 discount if you don’t mind missing out on the gorgeous ocean and terracotta colors. —Nena Farrell Casper's Hybrid Snow Pillow is our favorite pillow, period. It might not seem like it at first touch, but this pillow is super supportive for your head with its foam core and soft memory fiber surrounding it. Former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft found it to be his go-to pillow after testing tons of pillows for our guide. He says it's cooling, too, which is a nice bonus. He recommends catching it on sale, making now the ideal time to shop to get a little discount. —Nena Farrell This highly rated and reviewed body pillow on Amazon is my personal cheap pick for the Best Body Pillows for its relatively large size and comfiness. The plush fiber filling is soft enough that it can be contorted into many shapes and isn’t overstuffed, making it super easy to wrap your arms and legs around. The pillow refills back to shape without the filling getting bunched in one area or just going flat after a few weeks like some cheaper body pillows. I liked this super-soft pillow, and it’s a really great deal at a fraction of the price of other body pillows with comparable comfort. —Molly Higgins This large wall map is gorgeous. The world is shiny gold until countries and states are scratched off with a coin. It’s a great way to track your adventures, whether close to home or international. The colored areas of the map have nice details like major cities and topography, and while they’re appealing to look at, they’re also neutral enough that they’ll fit in with any decor. Check out our guide for more great gifts for travelers. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Branch’s Ergonomic Chair is my first recommendation for anyone who just wants to upgrade their crappy old seat without spending a fortune. It’s not perfect, but it’s quite adjustable, works for people of varying heights, and the high-density foam seat is cushy. You can lock the recline and adjust the lumbar support, and it helps that it’s also a very stylish office chair compared to its plain black competitors. For more discounts at Branch, read our separate story here. —Julian Chokkattu If your office chair budget is a little higher, then consider the Branch Verve. The main thing to note is that the arms are fixed—they can go up and down but not side to side. That’s my only real gripe with this chair; everything else is a nice upgrade over the Branch Ergonomic Chair, from build quality to back support. It also looks even more elegant, and there’s a headrest add-on if you want to shut your eyes and nap for a bit in between Zoom meetings. —Julian Chokkattu This chair is best suited for people under 5’9,” as it gave me back pain after several days in it (I’m 6’4”). After I asked a friend around 5’4” to try it, they liked it a lot and had no major qualms. It has a mesh back and a thick foam seat. Too bad it looks very, very dull. But maybe you want something nondescript! —Julian Chokkattu When it comes to writing, there’s nothing quite like the smooth 0.7 mm glide of the Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens. With 14 bold colors to choose from, this set is a rainbow of possibilities; whether you’re color-coding, writing in a planner, or doodling, their versatility and flair have earned them a permanent spot in our writing toolkit. —Boutayna Chokrane We love paper planners around here, and our favorite weekly planner is the Happy Planner. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found herself purchasing it year after year, and I can see why. It's got plenty of space for writing down plans and to-do lists, lots of fun covers, and a great price point. Score a planner for the new year (or a gift for your favorite planner person!) with Happy Planner's 30 percent off sale. —Nena Farrell It’s never too late to get organized and Class Tracker makes the best paper planners for students. There are monthly calendars, but the weekly pages shine. Each day sports a section for things to remember, tests, papers, or projects due, and larger spots for assignments and a daily plan. A Self-Care Corner gives you space for non-school things to focus on and a countdown box for something you're looking forward to. If you or the student in your life is struggling to get organized, this planner could help. —Simon Hill The Ryzen 9 7950X is one of AMD’s most powerful CPUs, and is on a steep discount. Anyone building a new PC or looking to upgrade theirs for raw computing power will want to check out this 16-core, 32-thread monster. The already ultra-fast 4.5GHz base clock can be pushed even higher with overclocking, making this an excellent choice for demanding workloads like video editing or 3D rendering. It’s also the perfect counterpart to a high-end GPU for the best possible experience in any video game. —Brad Bourque Logitech has a long history of great keyboards, and the MX Mechanical Mini is no exception. This wireless keyboard packs backlit keys, wired or wireless connectivity, and low-profile mechanical switches in your choice of tactile quiet, clicky, or linear. If you’ve got tons of devices, you should know the MX Mini also has wide support for operating systems and devices, including iOS. That makes this one of our favorite upgraded keyboards for tablet power users who want to unfold for a bit into a proper workstation. —Brad Bourque We recommended this Wi-Fi 6E system in our best mesh routers guide until it was replaced by the newer XE70 Pro, but this is still a good choice, especially with the discount. It is a tri-band (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) mesh with impressive range and stability. Each of the three routers has three Gigabit ports. By default, the 6-GHz band is reserved for wireless backhaul, but you can open it up for devices. If you have a connection of 1 Gbps or less, this mesh will serve you well. While enhanced security and parental controls require subscriptions, most folks can live without them. —Simon Hill Few USB webcams can match the Logitech C920 Pro’s quality, and at $50—half its usual price—it’s a bargain. With crisp 1080p and autofocus, it works great for video calls and streaming. Its white color balance is similar to the Razer webcam, and while the 78-degree field of view can be a bit tight, it just requires manual adjustments. It’s also missing a privacy shutter, but for a high-performing webcam, this is an unbeatable price. —Boutayna Chokrane The best Wi-Fi 6E router in our best routers guide, this hexagonal Asus router impressed in my tests. It’s a tri-band router, adding the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz. The new band is very fast, though it is relatively low range and doesn’t penetrate through walls very well. There’s ample connectivity with a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, a second 1-Gbps WAN/LAN, and a further three gigabit LANs. Asus also offers free security and parental controls and all the settings you need in the mobile app and browser interface, including band-splitting, prioritization for different activities, guest network, VPN support, and so on. —Simon Hill This affordable security camera is our pick of the best indoor security cameras because it offers clear 2K footage, with a starlight sensor that enables color night vision. Smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) is handy, and the slightly laggy two-way audio is fine. Pop in a microSD card (up to 512 GB) for local recording, or opt for a Tapo Care subscription for 30 days of cloud storage that starts at $3.50 per month. It also has an IP66 rating so it can be used outdoors. —Simon Hill This cute little indoor security camera is a cheaper version of our favorite model. It loses some features, like pet and vehicle detection, but TP-Link has reliable motion detection and customizable notifications. It's often on sale for around $20, but you can get it for extra cheap right now. —Nena Farrell Gamers don’t need a special gaming router, but if you love customizable RGB lighting, this mesh will tempt you. It’s not just fancy lighting that makes it worth a look, because this tri-band Asus ROG Rapture GT6 finished high up the table in most tests. With a single 2.4-GHz band and two 5-GHz bands (one is used for backhaul unless you connect the routers with an Ethernet cable), it can keep all your gaming gear online. The 5-GHz band supports wider 160-MHz channels and WPA3 for security. You also get AiProtection security software and comprehensive parental controls included without a subscription. The game modes boost performance and prioritize gaming traffic, and each router has a 2.5 Gbps WAN port, three 1 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port. —Simon Hill If you’re working in a hot environment, I highly suggest you get an all-mesh seat. These kinds of office chairs maximize airflow, allowing body heat to dissipate instead of trapping it. The Ergo3D has all the main points of adjustment you’d want and it’s a roomy chair. You even get two kinds of wheels in the box (casters or rollerblades) and you can insert whichever works best for your flooring. It’s not my favorite all-mesh chair, but it’s one of the few decent ones you’ll find south of $500. —Julian Chokkattu The SM57 is the most-used instrument mic in the history of recorded audio, by a large factor. It sounds great on guitar amps and beyond, and can be used to record essentially anything you need in a pinch. I’d stick to the extremely similar SM58 if you need a vocal mic, but if you need to record anything else, an SM57 is a must-have. —Parker Hall If you asked a child to draw a picture of a microphone, you’d get an image of the Shure SM58. This standard of stage and studio is so rugged you can use it as a hammer and it will still sound great after, though I don’t recommend you dent that iconic grille too soon. The dynamic microphone works great with any audio interface, and has a sound that you’ll be very familiar with if you’ve ever seen anyone sing live. —Parker Hall Shure’s SM7B microphone has been a studio staple for decades. While it’s gotten subtle improvements over the years, including an upgraded voice coil and a larger windscreen, it’s changed very little in its long tenure–you don’t mess with perfection. You’ll see this mic in multiple movies and TV shows (once you know it you can’t unsee it), as well as in real studios worldwide. It’s a killer option for podcasting and talk radio and works great as a vocal mic too. It’s designed to bring the best of your vocals to light, with little coloration so you just get the gritty goodness your unique voice provides. This is among the few standards I recommend first for any singer or creator, along with other favorites like the Electrovoice RE20, the do-it-all AKG C414, and the classic Shure SM58. —Ryan Waniata Every system needs a hard drive, and WD has been providing them for as long as I can remember. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but taking some dollars off this 1-TB internal drive might make it a more appealing second drive, or the main SSD in a budget-friendly system. With read speeds up to 560 MBps, you might not want to spend a ton of time transferring files on and off this drive, but it’s more than adequate enough for gaming and daily use, and priced well to boot. —Brad Bourque Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-looking Chromebook you can buy. The beautiful white design stands out in a sea of gray slabs. The Core i5 CPU offers plenty of performance to easily handle multiple tabs and app juggling. The webcam is nice too, much crisper than you’d expect for a $500 laptop. The downside is there's no backlit keyboard. —Scott Gilbertson The 13-inch Surface Laptop (7th Edition) (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor. Performance was good in our testing. It did not bog down no matter how many windows, tabs, and apps we threw at it. That said, this is not a machine for graphics-intensive tasks, like video editing or gaming (which is a shame because the vivid sharp screen with a 120-Hz screen refresh rate would be great for gaming). —Scott Gilbertson Dell's two larger XPS laptops (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are aimed at Windows users with MacBook jealousy. The design, specs, and sizes align perfectly with Apple's offerings. The XPS 14 has a gorgeous, sleek design (though it's thicker than a MacBook), a wonderfully bright and sharp OLED screen (with 120-Hz screen refresh rates), and is plenty speedy for everyday tasks. Unfortunately, heavy-duty tasks like video editing … well, the MacBook's benchmarks run circles around the XPS 14. Still, with this deal, this is a serious piece of hardware for not a lot of money. —Scott Gilbertson There's much to love about Samsung's Galaxy Book4 (7/10, WIRED Review), but let's be honest, that sticker price is insane. This deal brings it down somewhat, though it's still pricey. You do get impressive hardware—the new Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and current top-of-the-line processor in Intel’s Core Ultra CPU lineup, along with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card. The 16-inch AMOLED 2,880 x 1,800 pixels touchscreen is magnificent to work on and performance blew everything else we've tested out of the water. —Scott Gilbertson Who says you always have to buy the latest and greatest? If you get a tablet from Samsung’s 2023 Tab S9 series, you can save some serious cash and get an equally great experience (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Tab S9 is the smallest, and next comes the Tab S9+, both of which have AMOLED screens and are IP68-rated for water resistance. The Tab S9 Ultra is down to $800 ($400 off), and it’s massive and designed to be a travel-friendly computer when you don’t want to lug a laptop around. Also, check out the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Galaxy Tab FE+. If you just want a tablet to watch some shows, read, and play some games, these affordable slates are better than their predecessors, with smoother performance, and you still get a stylus in the box. They’re nearly identical—the FE+ just has more RAM and a bigger screen. —Julian Chokkattu The Galaxy Tab S10 series is the iPad Pro-equivalent of the Android world. The Tab S10+ has a reasonable 12.4-inch screen size, but the Tab S10 Ultra sports a massive 14.6-inch screen that is unwieldy to hold—you’ll want to pair it with a kickstand case. The Ultra is on sale for $1,000 ($200 off), but the Tab S10+ is much better value overall. You get the S Pen included for doodling and note-taking, the AMOLED screen is stunning, and it will receive 7 years of software updates. My primary issue is the price, and it’s still expensive at $850, but if you want the best tablet Android has to offer, this is it. —Julian Chokkattu You might think that giving your grandparents an older tablet might be fine, but things can get complicated fast if they’re not familiar with the software. Enter the GrandPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends). The company has been around for a decade and offers a custom tablet experience designed for seniors. That means larger touch targets, an easy-to-follow user interface, and LTE connectivity out of the box. There’s also 24/7 customer care and emergency 911 calling in case something happens. They won’t ever need to plug it in—just have them place it on the wireless charging dock and it’ll always be at the ready. The downside is this all involves a pricey subscription plan. If you buy directly from GrandPad, you get $100 off the annual subscription, but if you buy directly from Amazon, you get $100 off the tablet itself. You can’t use the tablet without a subscription. —Julian Chokkattu Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Bose’s Smart Soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite mini bar, even if it’s on the pricier side for a small bar that doesn’t come with a dedicated subwoofer. That means you’re sacrificing some punch down low, but in its place you’re getting fantastic immersion thanks to true upfiring drivers (something the Sonos Beam doesn’t have), Wi-Fi streaming and networking, and some innovative audio features. Those include a new AI dialog mode that brings forth voices and center-channel information with remarkable clarity. You can also now use the brand’s Open Earbuds as clip-on personal surround speakers. The Bose app is simple and intuitive, and lets you easily add other speakers like a Bose Bass module down the line. —Ryan Waniata Every TV deserves better sound, and this cheap soundbar and wireless subwoofer from Yamaha is a great way to get it. It’s super easy to set up with a simple HDMI eARC connection, and it brings a shocking amount of depth to content you probably watched through tinny TV speakers. Its little brother, the SR-C20A, has been our best soundbar for most of the year, and this brings more bass at a now-discounted price. —Parker Hall Sonos’ indomitable Arc (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has new competition from within courtesy of the Arc Ultra, which offers subtle but impactful sonic improvements and the ability to connect over 5GHz Wi-Fi. At $1,000, though, it’s not the best fit for all budgets. The regular Arc is still a winner, providing full and warm sound, excellent detail for dialog and music, and impressive immersion for surround sound and Dolby Atmos soundtracks via side- and up-firing drivers. Like other Sonos gear, you can add surround speakers or the new Sub 4 subwoofer, or connect with other speakers for all the multi-room audio tricks upon which Sonos made its name. You’ll also get built-in microphones for smart home control. Though Sonos’ app has had its struggles lately, it seems to be on more solid ground. If you’ve been waiting on a potent standalone bar with room for larger aspirations, this Arc deal is worth grabbing. —Ryan Waniata Klipsch’s Flexus Core 200 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) sounds bigger and brawnier than you’d expect for the money, pushing toward bars that cost twice as much. Its MDF construction (in place of plastic) offers deep and musical resonance, and its upfiring drives expand the sound to accentuate Dolby Atmos films and TV shows to cinematic heights (literally). Dialog is also clear and present thanks to a dedicated center channel. The trade-off is that there’s no Wi-Fi support as you’d expect for this price, but the bar is not without its innovative extras. As the name implies, the system provides flexible expansion with available surround speakers and a thumpy subwoofer. This bar is one of the best soundbars around for those who put sound quality first at full price, and a true bargain on sale. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals It’s hard to think of a more stalwart consumer electronics product over the last decade than Sony’s WH-1000XM4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Even four years after their debut, they serve as a benchmark for new contenders and premium offerings from top players alike. Their noise canceling isn’t top tier, but it’s still very good, and a raft of features—from a multi-band EQ to a touch control that turns on transparency mode temporarily for announcements or quick conversations—makes them feel advanced even as they gracefully age. Their sound is warm and bassy, yet refreshingly refined, and their durable plastic shells harbor plush padding for hours of comfort. You can outdo these noise cancelers with the latest Bose QuietComfort Ultra or Sony’s step-up WH-1000XM5, but there’s no question as to why Sony’s kept them around for multiple generations. —Ryan Waniata Technics isn’t the first name you think of for wireless earbuds, but the EAH-AZ80 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are among the best earbuds out there for their mix of a snug and comfy fit, great features, solid noise canceling, and sterling sound. The flashy gleam of their endcaps seems to tease their sound signature, which is slick, clear, and deeply textural to bring instruments to life. The AZ80’s noise canceling doesn’t catch Bose or even Sony’s top buds, but it’s good enough, and multipoint pairing with three different devices at once makes these buds uniquely versatile. This is a great pair at a good price, making them worth grabbing for those who put fit and sound quality first. Only the silver come in at the lowest price, but other colors are also steeply discounted. —Ryan Waniata Soundpeats has a knack for making affordable earbuds with exceptionally good sound. In fact, we recently gave their latest pair that uses a new kind of driver, the Soundcapsule 3+, a perfect 10/10. The Air4 Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are not that pair, but they serve up clear and balanced sound along with solid noise canceling for a very low asking price. They don’t have the spoils you’ll get in flagships like the AirPods Pro (even if they look a lot like them), but for well below $100 they’re a worthy option that could make a great gift for the budding music lover in your life. —Ryan Waniata Need a cheap pair of earbuds to not think too much about? Look no further than the Go Air Pop, which are utterly usable earbuds that cost less than $20. I like keeping a pair in my car or gym bag for when I forget to bring nicer buds with me and still want music. —Parker Hall I didn’t set out to love the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds (7/10, WIRED recommends). Even on sale, they’re pricey for such a limited use case, but damn if they haven’t become my favorite open earbuds on the market. Their curlicue barrel design takes some getting used to, but they roll onto your ears with impressive tenacity, staying put without pinching tight. Once in place, the little sound beams from their snake-like acoustic housings offer the most well-rounded performance I’ve heard in the genre. Like other open-ear models, you won’t get noise canceling or isolation so the sound is always blended with the world around you, but it’s a fantastic trick for working out or staying aware in any number of situations. These aren’t the best earbuds for every scenario, but if you can spend up for a targeted pair of standby buds alongside your best noise-canceling buds, you may just fall for them too. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra headphones (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are premium in style and performance, as you’d expect from the best noise-canceling headphones on the market. Their plush and ergonomic design makes them a joy to wear, while their penchant for noise-strangling makes them the ultimate choice for serious travelers or those who simply need unparalleled tranquility in their home or office. I also really enjoy the sound, which is less forward than Bose flagships past, while still providing excellent instrumental separation and deft balance. The battery provides a solid 30 hours per charge and the headphones add futuristic features like 3D audio virtualization with head-tracking to feel more like a pair of speakers. At well over $400, these are a serious splurge, but at this price they feel more like a steal. —Ryan Waniata The Jabra Elite series have been our top pick in our guide to workout headphones for years. Unfortunately, the company recently decided to stop making them. Although the earbuds have an unusually long two-year warranty, some of my colleagues would counsel you not to pick them. However, these are still the most comfortable and secure workout headphones that I’ve tried. They have an unusual feature, which is that you can plug the case into a 3.5-mm headphone jack to listen to them on a plane. It’s neat! These are still great for travel! —Adrienne So Jabra’s Elite 4 Active (9/10, WIRED Recommends) were almost shockingly good upon release a couple of years back, and they’re still an excellent buy today–especially on sale. As part of Jabra’s sporty overhaul, they blend serious durability with a comfy fit, smooth and balanced sound, and plenty of ways to personalize the experience in the Jabra app. They even provide a slab of noise canceling, though it’s more of an aid to their noise-isolating fit. They’re also dust and water-resistant, meaning you can dunk them or rinse them after a sweaty workout with no ill effects. Jabra has called it quits on consumer earbuds, but the stalwart brand pledges to support its current products through its warranty, so there’s no reason to hesitate. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take nearly everything we loved about the previous model a step further, offering a mix of fabulous features and excellent noise canceling, comfort, and sound quality. These headphones have everything, from multipoint pairing and auto-pause sensors to brilliant touch commands and Amazon Alexa support. They’re perfect for travel, but just as handy for wearing around the house. They’re not quite as packable as the previous model, the XM4, but that’s really the only flaw in an otherwise near-perfect package. —Ryan Waniata These bone-conduction headphones are the option you’re probably most likely to see in the wild. They use your jaw bones to route sound to your ears, which means you can hear everything around. This version is smaller than the newer second generation, which makes them better for folks with smaller heads (there is also a mini version on sale). —Parker Hall Jabra may be getting out of the earbud game, but the Elite 5 are still excellent earbuds that should last for many years of solid use. They’re comfortable and durable (IP55 rated), and the hybrid noise cancellation makes them great on flights or calls. Sound quality is excellent, with bold bass and enough midrange that you can hear every detail of the guitar or piano. —Parker Hall These are some of our favorite gifts for new parents, though anyone who experiences overstimulation might benefit from them. They’re designed for concerts to slightly reduce noise while still letting you hear. That makes them perfect for parents who need a little break from sleep training or the soundtrack of the Terrible Twos. You’ll still hear your kiddo, but you’ll be able to focus on their needs instead of that otherworldly screeching that can only be produced by a colicky newborn. —Louryn Strampe Denon’s PerL earbuds (7/10, WIRED Reviewed) don’t fit or feel quite like traditional earbuds, but their sound is seriously impressive thanks to the most advanced personalization system I’ve tested in the genre. These buds tune to your hearing profile, which for me equated to richer, fuller, and more intimate sound across my catalog. The profile they create may take some time to lock in, but once you do, it’s an impressive ride. I wasn’t convinced with the overall execution at $200, but at half the price, this is a killer deal for serious listeners. —Ryan Waniata The fully tweakable noise canceling inside these reflective workout earbuds makes them great for folks who like to be aware of their surroundings when outdoors but enjoy a bit of silence when inside. They have excellent sound quality and call quality and work as intended, allowing you to adjust how much of the outside world you want to hear at any given moment with easy-to-use touch controls. —Parker Hall Kids are extremely susceptible to hearing loss, which is why WIRED staffers who are parents love headphones like these that limit output to the OSHA-recommended 85 decibels. The noise canceling is excellent and will help with louder noises on flights or from HVAC, and these also come in either pink or blue, so you can get whichever color your kiddo prefers. —Parker Hall Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The WIRED Gear team battles over who gets to review each generation of this adorable Bluetooth speaker, because it’s just so handy. A tiny little rubber strap lets you attach it to everything from handlebars to backpacks. It sounds shockingly good for its size, too, and a rugged IP67 rating means you don’t need to worry if it takes a spill. —Parker Hall Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite speakers, and the Boom series is a standout. An update of the relatively ancient Boom 3, the Boom 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) brings long-awaited USB-C charging and modestly redesigned drivers. Its performance offers the same clear, smooth, and balanced presentation we’ve come to expect from the series. You’ll also get up to 15 hours of battery life, the ability to stereo pair with another Boom 4, and plenty of ways to adjust the sound in the app. This isn’t the bassiest speaker for its size, but its sound is more refined than cheaper knock-offs. Its primary drawback is its high price, which makes now the right time to strike. —Ryan Waniata Marshall’s pivot to rock-inspired Bluetooth speakers has been very successful from a product standpoint. These robust speakers feature great design and even better sound, plus I like that they have a strap that makes them easy to carry with other items when you’re packing in to a campsite. Twenty hours of playtime and 20 watts of output means you’ll be jamming loud and for a while, and an IPX4 rating means this is fine in the rain. —Parker Hall The best Bluetooth speakers offer a mix of durability, sound quality, and aesthetics, which is exactly how I’d describe this mid-tier model from Ultimate Ears. The folks who design these spend a lot of time testing their limits, from drop tests to bleach testing them in the desert sun, and that makes them great for folks who tend to be harder on consumer electronics. If you have a fisherman, hunter, or contractor in your life, UE is the brand for you. —Parker Hall Round Bluetooth speakers like this one might seem hard to place, but the built-in leather strap that comes with the Beosound A1 makes it very easy to hang anywhere you might need to. It’s a very well-made speaker, with a sleek metal exterior that can survive a heck of a lot of abuse. The normal downside is the price, which is negated by this deal. —Parker Hall JBL’s Authentics 200 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) speaks fluent Google and Alexa, letting you pick your smart home poison. That means it can act as a controller for multiple types of smart home products without the need for unifying smart protocols like Matter. The speaker’s stylish retro design provides further appeal, with a chunky foam grille reminiscent of JBL’s ’70s audiophile designs and real knobs for EQ and volume. Most important, the Authentics sounds fantastic, with warm and vibey mids, crisp treble, and wavy bass you can feel through the floor when it gets humming. Sonos models like the Era 100 and Era 300 are top of mind for most seeking an acoustically sound Wi-Fi speaker, but don’t sleep on the 200, especially at this new low price. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s newest Soundlink speaker is also its most expensive, but this sale makes its potent sound and size a lot more approachable. In his review, WIRED contributor Siman Lucas called the Max’s sound “as big, bold, and…upfront as it looks,” touting its penchant for refined bass and uncommon care for the rest of the frequency spectrum. That’s a great mix for a bass-forward model. It also proffers extras like 20 hours of battery life, IP67 weatherproofing, and a slick, travel-friendly design, making it among the very best Bluetooth speakers of its kind. —Ryan Waniata The only real downside to JBL’s best Bluetooth speakers is their high price. Grabbing them on a good sale is key, which makes this Clip 5 deal a top target. The perfect shower speaker does much more than just belt out your morning tunes. Its titular clip makes it easy to bring camping, attach it to your bike, or even clip it on your belt buckle as you clean up your yard or take the dog for a spin. The sound is full and surprisingly warm, with good detail and more bass than most pint-size rivals. Other features include 12 hours of battery (or 15 hours with the battery saver mode) and JBL’s handy app for adjusting the sound or connecting with other JBL models. —Ryan Waniata I loved the new Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) at full price, and at $100 or less it’s arguably the best value for a bass-thumping portable out there. The speaker matches musical low-end poise with swift instrumental attacks and vivid high-register detail. At times it pushes toward sharpness, but mainly stays free to provide an exhilarating sound signature with plenty of punch. It adds loads of features, including high-res audio support via USB-C input, one-touch pairing for Android or iOS, and 24 hours of battery life per charge, to make it among the best you can buy. It’s all encapsulated (sorry) in a premium design with IP67 weather protection for outdoor adventures. —Ryan Waniata I tested the R81+ of this Fluance for our Best Turntables guide, which adds a slightly upgraded cartridge and a platter with a more advanced dampener. Still, I would not hesitate to recommend this version, especially at just over $200. The R81’s best features are its solid build quality including a lift-lower mechanism that seems far too good for a turntable at this price. —Martin Cizmar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Fellow Aiden (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the most talked about coffee devices this year. It’s a sleek update on the classic Mr. Coffee from the 1970s: A drip machine to make drip coffee seem kinda cool again. It’s easy to use, it can be customized to each roast or bean with a simple dial twirl, and our reviewer marveled at how good the coffee was. The device is on sale but only if you also buy a bean grinder. Luckily, the Fellow Opus is also the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall grinder in existence. —Matthew Korfhage The Breville Barista Express is the lowest priced all-in-one espresso maker and frother we’ve found that’ll compete with the thousand-dollar big boys—a sturdy machine with precision, power, grace, and staying power. This is a longtime Gear team favorite: WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu has kept this on his counter for a half-decade. The slightly upgraded Pro version is also on sale this weekend, for about hundred more. —Matthew Korfhage The grinder on this surprisingly svelte KitchenAid machine (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is quite literally the quietest we’ve tested or measured, a whisper of a device that might not wake your significant other or your roommate when you desperately need a 6 am shot. The machine is thoughtfully and intuitively put together, but coffee dosing can be a bit finicky at first: Our Gear team testers noted it might take a few tries before you get it dialed just right. —Matthew Korfhage The Terra Kaffe is a pricey hunk of coffee machinery and has its bugs, but it’s one of few on earth to offer not just quality espresso and macchiato, but also true drip coffee that’s not Americano in disguise. This all arrives in a nifty, easy-to-clean package with a smart screen and all the trimmings. Using a phone app, you can begin warming the machine up from your bed, just like a remote starter on your car. Anyway, it’s a whopping $600 off, with an extra hundo off the top if you sign on for a coffee subscription. —Matthew Korfhage This is the best bean grinder we’ve found under $100, hands down. At the moment, it costs even less than that. At 16 inches high, the Oxo is a little tall to fit under a kitchen cabinet. But it’s durable, and it’s got a slim profile and a truly surprising ability to dial down to fine espresso grinds. —Matthew Korfhage The pricier Fellow or Baratza grinders likely win on overall execution. But what our Gear team testers prized greatly in KitchenAid’s burr grinder was its beauteous ease of cleaning, with burrs accessibly placed just beneath the hopper. Over the life of the product, this can matter more than you expect. We also liked the precise dose control and the helpful guidelines on grind settings. The universal merit of KitchenAid devices kind of tends to just be that they’re considerate of their users: “user-friendly,” to coin a term. Anyway, this is the lowest price we’ve seen on this model. —Matthew Korfhage The Cafe Barista was already our budget pick among fully automated cafe and espresso machines, and right now it’s on significant discount. If you don’t mind the plasticky casing, this low-cost device will make you a rich single or double espresso with a single push of the button, not to mention lattes and cappuccinos. —Matthew Korfhage This is what I use when I make cold brew at home. It’s an elegant, slim-profiled, no-fuss update to the classic Toddy device your favorite cafe probably uses to make a $5 cup of cold brew. Spoon in coffee, pour water over the nifty “rainmaker” top, then let it all sit for 16 to 24 hours. Filtering is as easy as sticking the immersion chamber atop the carafe. It takes patience, but not effort. And the resulting cold brew is delicious. —Matthew Korfhage Do you have a coffee lover on your gift list? Trade coffee is our favorite option for those who want variety, and this deal can get variety delivered to your loved one's door for less. Trade Coffee doesn't roast coffee. Instead, it acts as a middleman between small roasters around the country and you. Trade Coffee makes it possible to get specialty coffee beans from boutique roasters around the US without going on an epic road trip (though that would be a great road trip, so if you have the time, go for it, and send a postcard). —Scott Gilbertson Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) is truly tiny yet powerful. It’s the Alexa smart speaker I find myself always having set up somewhere in my house, even if I’m testing other voice assistants. This smart speaker might only be a few inches tall, but its audio quality can almost rival the larger Echos. The small footprint makes it easy to add almost anywhere in your home, too. The only downside is the price for such a small speaker, but this sale fixes that. —Nena Farrell If you want a smart display, this is the Goldilocks of the lot. The Echo Show 8 is the perfect size with its 8-inch screen to use for all kinds of features—smart home control, music player, video calls, even a little movie streaming—and packs a great speaker, a smart home hub, and a 13 MP camera. Use it as a digital photo frame, a smart home control center, or just a music jam session. Not only is this smart display fantastic, but it's nearly half off right now and available for the best price we've seen all year. —Nena Farrell The Echo Pop (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the cheapest Amazon Echo speaker on a normal day, and it's the only one you'll find for under $20. It's downright adorable, with a half-moon shape and a couple of fun colors you won't find in other Amazon speakers. It's not the most impressive speaker—no surprise with the smaller form factor it has—but it's not bad for the price, plus you'll get all the usual features of a smart speaker in it. —Nena Farrell Amazon's lineup of smart speakers is huge, but it all started with the true Amazon Echo. The fourth-gen model has an orb shape, rather than the tower of the first few models. But the updated shape also comes with fuller sound that can better fill a room and a built-in smart home hub that can connect to your devices directly over Matter or Zigbee. It's a great speaker and smart assistant, and the twilight blue color is on sale for half off. You can also find the black and white colors on sale for $5 more. —Nena Farrell If you want something just to control your smart home and answer your questions, nothing more, then the Amazon Echo Hub (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. This Amazon Echo speaker is designed to be wall-mounted, and looks like a smart home panel a custom designer would put into your home. Instead of needing your own designer and electricians to set this up, you'll just need your Alexa app and devices that work with it. The Echo Hub isn't meant for any other tricks; it has a speaker, but it's intentionally mediocre, and you'll be prompted to choose a different Amazon Echo in your home to be the primary sound device if you use the Hub for music. It's meant to be a companion to the rest of your existing smart home ecosystem, and as someone who primarily controls her smart home with her speakers, I love it. —Nena Farrell Not to quote my own review, but the Amazon Echo Spot (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is small yet surprisingly helpful. This second-gen model is back after being discontinued, with an updated look that matches the vibe of the Echo Pop that launched last summer (that's on sale too!). I was surprised how much I liked it—it takes my favorite quick-glance smart display features, shows me the weather and my calendar when I ask, and leaves out all of the clutter. It's a solid speaker for casual listening, though the Echo Dot is still the best of the pint-sized Amazon speakers. It's ideal for a bedside table, but I also like it for my desk. It's on sale for almost half off, so it's a great time to get one if you want it. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Canopy is our overall favorite among the suddenly ubiquitous filtered showerheads that now promise to remove all sorts of things from your water, presumably keeping your hair and skin more lustrous. Unlike many such filters, we discovered during testing that the Canopy does in fact remove troublesome chlorine compounds before its spray hits your hair and skin. It's also a good-looking showerhead with multiple spray settings and a lot of considerate touches that make it easy to use. Note that filters require replacement every three months or so, at $25-$35 a pop. —Matthew Korfhage I go through a lot of heat protectants while testing hair straighteners for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, and R+Co Bleu’s Hypersonic Heat Styling Mist is one of my go-to. It protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (also great for hair dryers and curling irons) and goes on kind of thick, like hairspray, so it’s definitely effective at fighting frizz but also isn’t so heavy that it weighs hair down. It also comes in sustainable packaging and is Leaping Bunny certified to be cruelty-free. All of R+Co’s products are 30 percent off, so R+Co’s diatomaceous earth-based Skyline Dry Shampoo is also worth a grab if you need a TSA-compliant dry shampoo for travel or are trying to stay away from aerosols. On the subject of hair products, IGK is also offering 30 percent off everything on its site. While testing for an upcoming guide to the Best Heat Protectants we’ve also become quite fond of IGK’s Good Behavior Smoothing Spray (protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit), which is $10 off in the sale. —Kat Merck This was a past budget pick in our electric toothbrush guide, and it’s still a great, affordable toothbrush. It’s cute, thin, and has a gentle cleaning vibration as a sonic toothbrush. It comes with a carrying case, too. —Nena Farrell Sonic toothbrushes are a little gentler than your standard oscillating toothbrush, and the Philips 4100 Sonicare is our favorite sonic toothbrush we’ve tried. We already like the 4100 for all the features it packs at its price point—two intensity levels, a pressure sensor, and a two-minute timer—and those features are an even better deal right now while this toothbrush is on sale. —Nena Farrell The Series 9 is Braun’s ”professional-grade” beard trimmer for the home set, with a quick and secure front control dial to change cut length, long battery life, and an excellent-quality main clipper attachment. Other attachments of equal quality allow tight detail work, or ruler-straight lines and edgework. It is, in short, our favorite overall beard trimmer—and it’s handsomely on sale. —Matthew Korfhage If you love the idea of a multi-tool system like the Dyson AirWrap but can’t stomach shelling out $600, the Shark FlexStyle (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. Like the AirWrap, there are two sets, one for “straight and wavy” and one for “curly and coily,” and both come with two brushes for drying and two barrels for curling. The wand bends at the middle to become a hair dryer that can be used alone or in concert with one of the brush attachments, and it even has one more heat setting than the Dyson—all for literally half the price. WIRED contributor Alanna Martine Kilkeary declared it the Best Multitasking Curler, while former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano deemed it a “near-perfect dupe” of the AirWrap. —Kat Merck Some people (like me) have stubborn hair that will only straighten with a flat iron, but others with more forgiving hair have a wider breadth of options, from hot brushes to air-assisted tools like Dyson’s AirWrap (8/10 WIRED Recommends). Yet another method is via the Tymo Ring, a straightening comb that former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano called in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners a way to take “the curl right out quickly—I didn't have to go over sections more than once or twice.” She also liked the outer shell that covers the hot teeth, so users are able to get closer to their roots without burning themselves. —Kat Merck As detailed in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this OG Chi is an oldie but a goodie—even though it’s got ceramic plates and only heats up to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s able to successfully smooth a broad range of hair types and textures. It’s lightweight, with 1-inch plates for easy maneuverability and waves, plus it’s got three heat settings and one-hour auto-shutoff for safety. I had one of these straighteners decades ago and it lasted nearly 10 years. Even though this isn’t the greatest sale I’ve ever seen, I still wouldn’t hesitate to buy it again. —Kat Merck This mascara has been my holy grail for years. There are a few drugstore dupes that come close, but in my opinion, nothing beats the real thing. It makes my lashes look long, thick, and velvety in just one coat, and in two coats I might as well be wearing falsies. I also appreciate just how deep and dark the black color is. If you want the most dramatic lashes of your life, this is the way. —Louryn Strampe If you’re looking for an alternative to a blow-dryer brush, the GHD Duet Style is a blow-dryer and flat iron combo that former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber thought worked just as well as the Dyson Airstrait (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Hot air vents through the device’s plates dry hair as it straightens for less damage overall, according to GHD. In our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, Victoria said she especially liked that the Shine Shot Mode could turn off the air and convert it to a traditional hair straightener. —Kat Merck I'm obsessed with blow-dry brushes. The Dyson got me hooked, but I've been pretty darn impressed with the T3 AireBrush on my post-shower hair. I've tried both the round and oval versions, and while I prefer the smaller round option for my chin-length bob, the oval works fantastic too for longer hair or if you like the blowout shape you’d get using a regular hairbrush. Either one is a great purchase, and both are 30 percent off for T3's sale. —Nena Farrell If you know, you know. Aquaphor is like magic. I use it on cracked cuticles, chapped lips, healing tattoos, dry knees, and even on my eyelids when I’m doing a glossy makeup look. This set comes with a travel-friendly 1.7-ounce tube as well as a giant 14-ounce tub. It should be enough to last you through this winter and next, and if you buy it frequently, this is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe With winter around the corner, your lips might start to feel more chapped than usual. This lip mask will help with that. The thick texture melts quickly and sinks straight into your dry skin, leaving your lips feeling less cracked. It also lasts long enough throughout the day that you won't have to constantly reapply the product—so the jar, while small, should last you for a while. —Brenda Stolyar Manscaped is best known for its viral below-the-belt Lawn Mower model. But above the neck, Manscaped’s Beard Hedger has its merits. Specifically, it sports a waterproof body, it’s great for a stubble trim, and its USB-C charger means you can charge it from your phone adapter or laptop. While the Hedger’s design may not be as elegant as some, this all adds up to make it a great travel device. —Matthew Korfhage Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This might just be the most incredible value of 2024. The Moto G Power 5G already impressed me (8/10, WIRED Recommends) earlier this year with its solid performance and 120-Hz LCD screen, not to mention the support for NFC to make contactless payments and even wireless charging. At this $200 discount, it’s a shockingly good Android phone, though its biggest flaw is that it will only receive an update to Android 15, and that’s it. You’ll still get two more years of security updates though. —Julian Chokkattu Flip phones are all the rage. These folding phones work like normal smartphones, but you can fold them in half to stow them in a pocket or purse. What’s not to love? Well, battery life isn’t great (you can just barely eke out a day with average use), but they’re cute and fun, plus Samsung’s build quality is exceptional (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Galaxy Z Flip6’s external screen isn’t as useful as the cover screen on Motorola’s Razr+, but this is still a well-built flip phone at a reasonable price. —Julian Chokkattu Want a booklike folding phone? My top pick is the Google Pixel 9 Pro, but Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Fold6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is even cheaper! It has excellent build quality (Samsung has been doing this for six years after all), and the external display is wider than before, making it nicer to use. The cameras are great and the screens are bright, though it doesn’t open up to as large a screen as the Pixel. —Julian Chokkattu If, like me, you've been chasing the feeling of using your Blackberry Curve for over a decade now, then I have the accessory for you. It's called the Clicks Keyboard case (8/10, WIRED Recommends) and it's the first-of-its-kind iPhone case with a built-in keyboard. It's a great option for someone who relies on their phone for tasks like sending off emails, typing up documents, responding to Slack messages, and more. It'll take a while to get used to the tactile keys though—days or weeks depending on how quickly you build up muscle memory. We also only recommend it for the iPhone 16 lineup. It comes with a redesigned keyboard, a slightly more durable design, and support for MagSafe and CarPlay. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the latest model to join Apple's lineup. It also holds the top spot in our guide to the Best Apple Watches. Compared to its predecessor, it not only has a bigger display, but it's also thinner, lighter, and packs support for fast charging. The smartwatch also runs WatchOS 11, so you'll have access to features like Vitals (to check your baseline every morning) and Training Load (to see how your workouts are impacting your fitness over time). It's worth noting that it doesn't pack a blood oxygen sensor, though. —Brenda Stolyar The Ultra 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our top pick for outdoor sports. Under the hood is an S9 chip for faster performance and an ultra-wideband chip with enhanced precision finding. You'll also have access to dual-frequency GPS, offline maps (that you'll have to download to your iPhone), and Backtrack for creating virtual breadcrumb trails on the Compass app via the Action button. —Brenda Stolyar The best running watch will probably always be a Garmin Forerunner. The line ranges from the barebones Forerunner 55 to the spendy Forerunner 965 for triathlons, but I think the Forerunner 165 has pretty much everything you need. The more you spend, the more sensors you get, and the Forerunner 165 has blood oxygen sensing plus a barometric altimeter, compass, and ambient light sensor, in addition to the now-standard fall detection and multiple satellite positioning systems. —Adrienne So Yes, the price is lower now that the new Oura Ring 4 has been released. But I wore the Oura Ring Gen3 for many years and found it to be accurate, attractive, and comfortable (once all the features it had promised in 2021 became available). Some days, I even find myself missing the three little bump optical sensors on the back of my ring. This is a pretty remarkable deal for a one-of-a-kind fitness tracker that started a whole product category all by itself. —Adrienne So There are a few pretty great Fitbit deals going on right now, but if you have kids, I suggest going for the Fitbit Ace LTE. Unlike the Apple Watch, it’s not phone-specific, so your kid can use it even if you and your spouse are an Android/iPhone family (if so, why?). It has a ton of fun, movement-based games that are an incentive for your kid to actually remember to charge your watch and keep it on. I understand that feelings are mixed on giving kids smart devices, but it helps us all keep track of each other as my kids walk around the neighborhood and it stops me from having to text everyone else’s parents all the time. —Adrienne So Samsung tried to make a squircle-shaped Apple Watch Ultra competitor and it’s … OK (7/10, WIRED Review). The company also targeted Apple-like pricing, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra didn’t have complete feature parity and its software isn’t as polished. Still, this is a powerful smartwatch with a few extra features over the company’s standard Galaxy Watch7, and it’s much more reasonably priced with this discount, which ends on December 1. —Julian Chokkattu The latest iteration of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch series has some artificial intelligence algorithms to improve your health tracking data, like giving you a comprehensive Energy Score and updated sleep tracking abilities. It can also detect if you have sleep apnea. However, editor Julian Chokkattu found battery life frustrating compared to older models, and it’s worth noting you won’t get the full functionality unless you pair it with a Samsung phone. —Adrienne So The OnePlus Watch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) had one job: stand out from other Wear OS smartwatches, and it succeeded. Unlike Samsung’s Galaxy Watch7 or Google’s Pixel Watch 3, OnePlus prioritized battery life over all else, and thanks to a clever dual-processor and dual-operating system hybrid architecture, the Watch 2 can last roughly three days on a single charge. Hooray! The health tracking isn’t its strong suit, but this is a Wear OS smartwatch so you’ll find many rich smart features, though it’s only compatible with Android phones. You can save even more by going with the OnePlus Watch 2R for $170 ($60 off), which has a screen that doesn’t get as bright, no sapphire crystal coating over the glass, and an aluminum build over stainless steel. —Julian Chokkattu This is still the watch that I would wear if I didn’t have to test other fitness trackers—and I’m not the only one, because Garmin’s Instinct line is one of the company’s most popular. It has all the backcountry capabilities of the higher-end Fenix and Epix lines, but it’s more affordable because it ditches the fancy screen. The Instinct 2 Solar’s battery life lasted almost three weeks when I tested it in Hawaii, where I used it to keep track of everything from trail runs to keeping me oriented toward the beach when snorkeling. —Adrienne So The Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our guide to the best fitness trackers thanks to the perfect balance of attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, and ease of use. Google’s takeover has led to several smart integrations with Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music Premium. This tracker can keep tabs on your skin temperature, 24/7 heart rate, activities, and sleep schedule. You can also expect week-long battery life, but the best features still require the $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription. —Simon Hill Garmin recently combined its two high-end Epix and Fenix lines in the updated Fenix 8 series, which we will be including in our Best Fitness Trackers roundup. However, if you have no particular need for voice commands or new, leakproof buttons for scuba, the second-gen Epix Pro is still a great buy, and it’s now much cheaper! Use the beautiful AMOLED screen to access Garmin’s detailed proprietary maps. And I’m a little embarrassed by how much I like the onboard flashlight. —Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This isn't technically a deal, but retailers are currently offering Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta Quest+, its game subscription program, through April 2025. If you've never tried a VR headset and you're curious, this is one of the best and easiest ways to start playing loads of games to see if you like it. We also think the Quest 3S is one of the cheapest and lightest ways to get into gaming (it will still make you slightly nauseous if you're not used to it, though.) —Adrienne So This is our top gaming headset recommendation because it uses Logitech’s Lightspeed connection system (with a 2.4-GHz dongle) for low-latency audio (important when playing fast-paced games). You can also use Bluetooth if you’d like, or jack in with the 3.5-mm headphone jack. That makes it more versatile than ever. The boom mic arm is detachable so you can wear this out of the house without feeling like you’re headed to a call center. Our previous top pick was the G Pro X 2’s predecessor, and it’s also on sale for $81 ($19 off). But that one’s a wired headset so you have fewer connectivity options. —Julian Chokkattu As the younger sibling to the impressive HyperX Cloud Alpha, these boast an incredible 120 hours of claimed battery life, in some cases four times its competitors. That truly astounding number is backed up by crisp sound quality and a high level of compatibility. The included USB-C dongle and USB-A adapter let you plug them into almost any system you can find, so nothing will stand between you and your games, particularly having to recharge. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation VR2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best VR headsets, featuring a comfortable, adjustable headband, excellent eye-tracking that allows you to select menu items or track objects by looking at them, and it comes with two controllers. If you crave immersion, you’ll find it here. The headset requires a PS5 and this is a tasty discount, but we recommend going for the PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of The Mountain Bundle ($349) since it is the same price and includes one of the best PS VR2 games in Horizon Call of the Mountain. —Simon Hill Our favorite gaming headset for multi-platform gamers, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X supports almost every modern system under the sun, including the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and basically anything else with a USB-C port or Bluetooth. It’s also super comfortable for long gaming sessions, with plush ear cups and the classic SteelSeries support band. At just $100, these very well might be your favorite new pair of wireless gaming headphones. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation 5 Slim is a slimmed-down version of the PlayStation 5 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) that’s around 30 percent slimmer. It runs the same list of great PS5 games but takes up less space beneath the TV. We have a breakdown of the different PlayStation 5 models if you want to dive deeper, but the PS5 Slim is the only one on sale and a 15 percent discount is decent if you’re in the market for a Sony console. —Simon Hill Even at its full price of $40, the Logitech G203 feels like a solid deal, but for half that, it’s a downright steal. It has six programmable buttons, full support for the Logitech G Hub software, and RGB lighting—what else could you ask for? The only real compromise here is the 8,000 DPI max, but as long as you can live with that, this is a great budget-friendly gaming mouse or a perfect backup mouse for traveling or emergencies. —Brad Bourque Compact gaming keyboards like the Razer Huntsman Mini make a lot of sense for gamers with limited desk space. As long as you can live without a num pad or arrow keys, you’ll find all the features you’d expect from a full size offering in this compact keyboard. That includes Razer’s excellent software support, keycap compatibility, and excellent build quality. All that adds up to a big deal on a small board, and it’s just part of the reason the Razer Huntsman Mini is our favorite small keyboard. —Brad Bourque With a million mechanical keyboards on the market, it can be tough to stand out, but the Corsair K100 does just that with its built-in control wheel. This programmable knob can adjust keyboard lighting or other built-in keyboard functions, but more fun is the option to set it to control media playback on your system. You’ll also get RGB backlighting, a volume control wheel, and a set of macro keys along the left side, all features we’d expect from a mechanical keyboard at this price point. —Brad Bourque The Steam Deck might be all about portable handheld gaming, but sometimes you just wanna plug it into a bigger screen, just like a Nintendo Switch, especially if you want to play a game with a keyboard and mouse. This aluminum Jsaux 7-in-1 Steam Deck Dock will do the job, with three USB-A ports, a DisplayPort, an HDMI, a USB-C, and even an Ethernet port. —Julian Chokkattu I didn’t think I’d love Disney Dreamlight Valley when I first installed it, but it quickly became one of my favorite cozy games. It’s fantastic on the Nintendo Switch but available for other consoles. It’s a life sim where you’ll run around collecting items, farming crops, fishing, and decorating, but it also has a surprisingly grown-up storyline that might entice even those of us who don’t have fond memories of Disney movies or shows. The Cozy Edition comes with bonus cosmetics that you don’t get with the base game. Pro tip: Plant all the pumpkins. —Louryn Strampe It’s always nice to see a solid deal on our favorite keyboard. The Logitech G Pro X TKL Lightspeed might have a mouthful of a name, but it’s as streamlined and stylish as they come. It sports bright backlit keys with your standard RGB setup, wireless connectivity, and a minimal, high quality design that fits right in on any desk. Beyond media controls and some buttons for functionality, the G Pro X TKL packs just the right features, and leaves the rest on the cutting room floor, which is why we like it. —Brad Bourque If you’re looking for a simple joystick for gaming, it’s hard to beat the value on the Logitech G Extreme 3D Pro USB Joystick. It isn’t the fanciest, and its plastic construction won’t impress true enthusiasts, but you’ll spend two or three times the price to get anything similar from a manufacturer as reputable as Logitech. It also sports a huge number of buttons, both on the handle and on the base, and a throttle slider that’s not as common on joysticks at this price point. That makes it the perfect joystick for a quick flight in Microsoft Flight Simulator or a few hours of space trucking in Elite Dangerous. —Brad Bourque The hardest console gamers know that quick reactions can be the difference between total glory and complete failure, so give yourself every advantage with the SCUFInstinct Pro controller for Xbox. This upgraded controller features improved materials for grip and comfort, plus a more premium build quality, but the best part is hidden around back. Four programmable paddles allow you to put your most important buttons right at your fingertips for lightning-fast access, giving you the ultimate edge against anyone who has to move their hand to hit the melee button. —Brad Bourque Our favorite USB microphone is sporting a decent discount, as it is fairly often. The Blue Yeti has a long history on the desks of streamers and podcasters, and for good reason. It sports solid audio performance, great build quality, and easy access to controls. That makes it a great option for anyone looking to upgrade from their gaming headset’s microphone, or to pair with some better headphones. —Brad Bourque This Intel Core i7-14700K 8-Core 5.6 GHz (LGA 1700 Socket) chip is a very solid performer and will work with any 700-series chipset-based motherboard. It'll get you through heavy workday tasks like video editing with ease and can handle 4K gaming. —Scott Gilbertson This is one of the best game controllers for PC gamers, with five central buttons on the front, a pair of rear paddles, and plenty of customization options. 8BitDo’s software lets you remap buttons, tweak the stick and trigger sensitivity, assign macros, and tune the vibration intensity. It’s compact with a grippy texture on the handles, satisfyingly clicky triggers, and a decent D-pad. There’s a 2.4G dongle in the handy charging dock for PC gaming, and battery life is around 20 hours. It also has Bluetooth support for Nintendo Switch players, making this a solid alternative to the Switch Pro controller. —Simon Hill Feel free to take $40 off the reasonably equipped Gigabyte B650, a mid-range AMD Ryzen motherboard with support for DDR5 RAM, 2.5Gbps Ethernet, and USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. While it isn’t the highest-end offering, notably missing PCIe 5.0, it still supports overclocking, and even has built-in Wi-Fi for easy connectivity. Make sure to check out our PC building guide for more info on what you should be looking for when purchasing a motherboard. —Brad Bourque Western Digital also makes excellent SSDs, and this one is no exception. The SN 770 M.2 2280 achieved speeds of 5,100 Mbps in my testing, which is blazing fast. If you're doing a lot of drive-intensive tasks, like editing video or gaming, this drive is well worth the money. The largest version you can get is 2 TB, but the price is reasonable considering the speed increase. —Scott Gilbertson Viture's Pro XR Glasses make for a great portable gaming display you can take anywhere. They have a large, virtual screen (135 inches), a smooth 120-Hz frame rate, and a maximum brightness of 4,000 nits. The company has done a solid job with the software too and tailored the experience for gamers. You can also, however, use these for watching movies or multitasking work. However, it's worth noting the Harman-tuned speakers are limited. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This LifeStraw has been featured in many an iteration of our outdoorsy gift guide (though we’ve replaced it this year). Nevertheless, it’s a good product. This LifeStraw can screw onto a plastic water bottle or be used as a straw to slurp up water from basically anywhere. It filters out at least 99.99 percent of bacteria, microplastics, and other gross contaminants. If you’re shopping for a prepper this holiday season, or you’re just like me and ill-prepared for the zombie apocalypse, this deal is worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe The Leatherman Wave+ is our top pick multi-tool. The tools flip out and retract with just the right mix of smoothness and tension, and the mix of tools here is very useful—two stainless steel knives, one with a straight edge and the other serrated, along with 16 other tools, including a wood-and-metal file, a diamond-coated file, a saw, Phillips screwdriver bits, scissors, an 8-inch ruler, and a wire stripper, as well as a bottle and can opener. The Branwyn bra is in our essential guide to merino wool, but I like it enough that I wrote a whole separate rave about it. Merino wool is a miracle fiber—it’s renewable, odor-resistant, regulates your temperature and doesn’t leave you with a terminal case of swamp booty should you choose to jump in a river with your hiking clothes on. What’s not to like? Everything at Branwyn is 25 percent off through December 3 (just add to your basket to see the discount). —Adrienne So I love my pellet smoker for cooking everything from meat to pizza—as does WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson in our guide to the Best Grills—which is why I highly recommend this Traeger. It can connect to Wi-Fi for easy monitoring of longer cooks, and features the classic easy-to-clean Traeger design that made the brand an icon in the first place. —Parker Hall The Breeo is the most overbuilt option on our best fire pits guide and wins our favor by opening the door to a complete ecosystem of products including a live-fire pizza oven and a flat-top grill for making smashburgers. This is a sizable sale on the pit. —Martin Cizmar Like the Coleman above, the RoadTrip 225 allows you to use only one burner, so you can grill a couple of burgers without draining your propane tank. With variable controls, you can sear veggies on one side while cooking meat more slowly on the other. There's a grease pan to catch drips while cooking, and it's removable for cleaning. You also get push-button ignition and 11,000 BTUs of propane grilling power. At this price, it's hard to beat these features. —Louryn Strampe Cupping therapy can be intimidating, but the TheraCup makes bringing spa-level treatment at home easy. It blends suction, heat, and vibration to mimic the effects of traditional cupping therapy. I’ve found it user-friendly, and with its auto-shutoff and safety sensors, I don’t have to worry about overdoing it. At $129 ($20 off), it’s a solid investment that will save you from splurging on professional sessions. —Boutayna Chokrane If you’re tired of itchy or sweaty socks, these Carhartts are a solid upgrade. WIRED’s self-proclaimed sock-hating outdoorsman, Scott Gilbertson, is living proof that these socks can convert even the most dedicated barefooters. He’d rather brave the snow wearing a pair of sandals; that is, until he was gifted the Carhartt Midweight Merino Wool Blend Crew Socks. These woolies are designed to keep your feet warm, dry, and odor-free—even after a full day of hiking. The midweight design strikes the ideal balance between breathability and insulation, perfect for year-round excursions. —Boutayna Chokrane The LifePro Sonic Massage Gun proves you don’t need to spend a fortune for a deep-tissue massage. With eight included attachments—yes, eight—it’s the most versatile massager we’ve tried. It’s more than capable of working even the most stubborn knots, and with five intensity levels, don’t worry about whether it packs a punch. —Boutayna Chokrane The PowerDot 2.0 Muscle Stimulator is a recent addition to my recovery routine. It pairs with your smartphone to provide personalized muscle recovery and strength training, and ease menstrual cramps. When I first tried it, I expected a sharp zap, but the sensation was surprisingly soothing, like a prickly, customizable massage. The Duo is ideal for multiple or larger areas, and it comes with everything you need: electrode pads, lead cables, a charger, and a carrying case. Note: I’ve encountered some connectivity hiccups with the app, and online reviews suggest I’m not alone. Still, when it works, it’s brilliant. —Boutayna Chokrane Niu’s scooters have long been reliable for me, with simple folding mechanisms and a comfy riding experience. That continues with the KQi 300X, a 49-pound escooter with 10.5-inch tubeless tires, regenerative braking, and a 16-mile range in my tests (I’m 6’4”, so you can probably go even further.) This one has turn signals too, though they are not time-based and need to be turned off manually. Still, this is one of the lower prices I’ve seen and great value. —Julian Chokkattu A sub-$3000 electric mountain bike is amazing, and Aventon’s version has incredible specs for the price point. Reviewer Steph Pearson was impressed by its smooth, consistent power. Its weight is a bit much (OK, it’s a lot) for technical singletrack, but if you have a commute that incorporates steep hills, dirt roads, or potholes, it’s the perfect ride.—Adrienne So If you just want something for quick trips to the grocery store or just puttering around your neighborhood, the Segway E2 Pro is probably more than enough. It’s affordable, even more so now with this deal, and the 350-watt motor does a decent job with small slopes. It’s 41 pounds, but you get tubeless tires, good brakes, and a 15-mph top speed. I usually managed a little under 10 miles. It’s also rare to see turn signals on an affordable scooter, which is a nice perk. Want to save even more? I’ve also tested the E2 Plus, which is now $280 ($70 off). It’s lighter and slower, but it does the job for short trips. —Julian Chokkattu I’ve now tested more than 50 pickleball paddles to make our guide to the best, but I have a soft spot for the SLK Evo, which was the first nice paddle I bought with my own money. It has a nice neutral feel and a great grip. You won’t be able to get much top spin off the fiberglass face, but it’s fine for anyone below the advanced level. —Martin Cizmar This inflatable hot tub is nice! The Coleman SaluSpa Ibiza (7/10, WIRED Review) is easy to set up and generally user-friendly. It takes a while to heat up, but when it’s rolling, it’s a great place to relax and unwind. The pump module has built-in cupholders and there are optional air jets to bubble away all of your worries. It’s got room for four to six people, though I think six would be a bit too cozy. Just make sure you have the space for it before purchasing. —Louryn Strampe Movement begets more movement! WIRED contributor Kristin Canning would have paid even full price for this walking pad. It feels good underfoot (she often walks on it wearing just socks), isn’t annoyingly loud, and doesn’t shake her standing desk. You can control it with both the remote or the app, and Canning prefers the app as the Bluetooth connectivity can get a bit wonky. —Adrienne So No one I know has ever regretted getting a walking pad. It helps even the least motivated of us get a little more movement into our day. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano noted that the Egofit is compact and easy to use and move. You can control it with a remote, and the digital screen displays time, calories burned, distance walked, steps, and walking speed (be warned, though, there is no pause button). —Adrienne So In our Smart Bird Feeders Buying Guide, we recommend this model as the prettiest, and we also like that it’s made with less plastic than other feeders. This bamboo Netvue Birdfy (6/10, WIRED Review) features an extendable perch and two large bins for bird seeds, and it includes a solar panel so you won’t need to charge or replace the batteries. The included 1080p camera will show you video feeds and pictures of bird visitors. You can pay more to get a lifetime subscription with AI that’ll help identify birds—though sometimes it gets it wrong. Note that, although it’s rot- and mold-resistant, it does need to be sealed with a bird-safe wood sealer. —Louryn Strampe This adorable stroller takes the features of a full-size stroller and packs them into a smaller package. The Thule Shine’s (9/10, WIRED Recommends) adjustable handlebar works for a huge variety of heights—both my 5’ mom and my 6'4" dad could comfortably push my son around in this stroller thanks to the five different height options, and the stroller can switch to do inward or outward facing and has accessories for car seats and a bassinet. It's one of my favorite full-sized strollers I've ever tried, and it's on sale for a nice discount. —Nena Farrell In our Best Treadmills roundup, WIRED contributor Kristin Canning notes that the incline ranges on the BowFlex Treadmill 22 are much greater than our top pick, the NordicTrack. That means it’s ideal for hill training, or if it’s dark and late outside and you can’t make yourself drive anywhere to prep for an upcoming road race. Bowflex has its own proprietary fitness programming with both on- and off-tread options, but you can also stream your own shows and movies, too. —Adrienne So Even if we weren’t always scaling rugged peaks, we used Rocky Talkies on almost every camping trip—you need a better way to talk to your family besides running around and yelling. Rocky Talkies have a few advantages over cheap walkies. They come with a carabiner to clip on your pack or clothes, so they don’t slide off; the battery life is much better, and it’s much easier to use. The push-to-talk button is even recessed so you don’t accidentally transmit your shit-talking. The waterproof mic and extra battery are also on sale. —Adrienne So We're huge fans of the Peloton Tread, it's actually one of the best home treadmills we've tested so far. It's sleek and beautiful, so it won't be an eyesore in your house and you'll have access to some of the most engaging fitness programming out there—complete with great music, top-tier instructors, and fun workouts. If you're more interested in one of the company's bikes, those are also on sale for up to $700. —Brenda Stolyar Jumping rope is one of the best ways to get an intense cardio workout without needing a lot of space, and Crossrope is one of the most fun ways to do it. It builds strength in the shoulders, forearms, and legs, and doing double-unders, crossovers, or other complicated steps is just fun. Subscribe to the app, get access to 2,500 workouts and over 35 different fitness programs, watch videos, and use your Bluetooth-connected jump rope to really show those CrossFitters what’s what. —Adrienne So Nothing can possibly fix you as much as cold plunges can, but devotees of the practice will tell you otherwise. Sun Home’s premium version is the only portable cold plunge tub that’s capable of getting to as low as 33 degrees, which you will need once you’ve acclimated to 40 degrees and need to get even colder to chase that euphoric high. It’s also sturdy, chills water quickly, and surprisingly, doesn’t add too much to your electricity bill.—Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you’re in the market for a travel bag, the Dagne Dover Petra Convertible Tote is a chameleon of carryalls. It’s part backpack, part tote, and even has a luggage pass-through that is a back-saver during long treks through airports. At nearly 17 inches tall, this bag is big, but it still fits under most airplane seats. We’re particularly fond of the padded compartments, offering extra protection for your tech gear and one less thing to worry about while rushing to your gate. —Boutayna Chokrane I love Calpak's clear cosmetic cases. They were viral for a reason, since it's easy to see where everything is thanks to the clear design, and the two separate sides make it easy to keep it from becoming a massive mess inside the bag. While the clear cases come in three sizes, only the largest size is on sale. WIRED editor Kat Merck didn’t find this case the easiest to travel with while reviewing it for the Best Toiletry Bags guide, but I use the medium-sized bag for my daily makeup. The large case is a great choice if you have a lot of makeup and skincare you're looking to easily store and keep organized. There are a couple colors that are 30 percent off, but most are 20 percent off, which is still a good deal. —Nena Farrell A carry-on is a highly personalized purchase—it’s both an accessory and one of the bags that endures the most abuse when you use it. Aer’s is more expensive than some of our other picks, but I particularly liked Aer’s for a few reasons. The polycarbonate surface doesn’t pick up dirt as easily as the Monos, and it doesn’t have ridges like the Beis. It also has specialized Hinamoto metal ball bearings for smoother rolling, as well as wheel locks, so it doesn’t slide all over the place when you have to take it on a shuttle. All of Aer’s luggage is 25 percent off through Dec. 2, but you’ll need to enter a SAVE20 discount code to get the deal. —Adrienne So Staying hydrated feels almost effortless with the Owala 40-ounce tumbler. We love Owalas for a few reasons: They’re free of BPA, lead, and phthalates, which should be a minimum standard for reusable water bottles. Owala’s trademark 2-in-1 lid makes this tumbler work with hot, cold, and carbonated beverages. And Owala’s limited-edition color palettes are dangerously addictive, making it hard not to grab one in every shade. So, if you’re eyeing a certain design, there’s no time like the present. —Boutayna Chokrane Several WIRED Gear team members use the Front-Range Harness. While I use the attachment point at the top behind my pup’s head, my colleague uses the bottom one, so if her dog Roux chases after a squirrel and pulls on the leash, he’ll just spin and face her. It has reflective strips for increased visibility and there’s padding for the undersides so they don’t dig in. They’re well-made and have held up after years of use. —Julian Chokkattu Some travel mugs dent if you so much as look at them wrong, but not the Hydro Flask. Its signature powder-coated exterior is as durable as it is sleek. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has been using hers for years without a single ding, making it a reliable choice for your busiest days and clumsiest moments. Plus, no lead here—unlike certain other tumblers we know (looking at you, Stanley). —Boutayna Chokrane Editor Kat Merck is obsessed with the Dagne Dover Mila Toiletry Organizer, which she uses for her cosmetics. Made from recycled materials, it’s sustainable, water-resistant, and easy to clean. Merck especially loves the thoughtful compartments: the carabiner for jewelry, the zippered pouch for hair ties and bobby pins, and the elastic loops for makeup brushes. The sections can feel snug for more than two full-sized products but are perfect for travel-sized essentials. P.S., the small model is also on sale for $38. —Boutayna Chokrane An honorable mention in our guide to the Best Toiletry Bags, this toiletry kit is a decent option for those who want a simple, well-made bag that can either hang or lay flat. There’s a snap-in plastic envelope for soap or a toothbrush, and the navy version I tested is made from recycled bottles. I wasn’t especially impressed with the bag’s organizational components in comparison to its size, and I didn’t like that the bag’s thick, small plastic hook couldn’t hang on a towel rack, but otherwise, I had no major complaints during my weeks of testing. It should also be noted this bag comes in almost 20 different colors and prints, from metallic pink to a basketball motif, so at this price it would make a great gift for adults and kids alike. —Kat Merck The Travelrest Nest Ultimate Travel Pillow (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is nearly perfect. The back is flat, which keeps your spine aligned, whereas the sides and front are high and firm, which keeps your neck supported. The microfiber cover is soft and machine washable, and the memory foam cover holds its shape without compressing too much. We just wish the stuff sack had an attachment point for easier toting around. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Our favorite mirrorless camera, Sony's A7 IV (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a 33-megapixel, full-frame camera capable of incredibly sharp images, with excellent dynamic range and great autofocus, and it's smaller than most of its competitors. There's five-axis image stabilization built-in, and it can shoot 7K oversampled 4K/30 fps video. —Scott Gilbertson The A7R V is the highest-resolution stills camera on the market (unless you opt for medium-format cameras). If that's not enough, there's a 16-shot, high-resolution mode that can create 240-MP images (so long as your subject is static, e.g., a landscape). The dynamic range is outstanding, and the autofocus speeds and smarts are some of the best we've seen. The only down side is the file size; fully uncompressed RAW files from this sensor run around 125 megabytes per image, though there are compressed options that will get them down to about 80 MP per image. —Scott Gilbertson GoPro's new Hero 13 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic action camera. The Hero 13 features a new interchangeable lens system, with Macro, Ultra Wide, and Anamorphic lenses, plus a set of four neutral density filters (all sold separately). The Hero 13 Black even autodetects which lens is attached and changes settings accordingly. It's a slick, if expensive, system, but this deal at least saves you some cash on the base camera, which you can put toward an extra lens. Except the Anamorphic, which won't be available until 2025. —Scott Gilbertson This deal has been running since the new Hero 13 Black launched earlier this year, and if you have the extra $40 to spare, I highly recommend the Hero 13 over the 12. But if you're on a tight budget, or just don't have any interest in the interchangeable lenses, the Hero 12 uses the same sensor and makes a great action cam. —Scott Gilbertson The DJI Air 3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains one of our favorite drones, despite the brand new Air 3S. The new Air 3S brings larger sensors, which do improve the video a bit, but the Air 3 is still a fantastic dual-camera drone and, at this price, a better value than the new Air 3S. —Scott Gilbertson The Osmo Action 4 has been surpassed by the new Osmo Action 5, but the Action 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is still a fantastic action camera, especially at this price. The magnetic mounting system is great, the menu system makes switching between modes a snap, and the resulting photos and video are excellent. —Scott Gilbertson Insta360's Ace Pro was just replaced by the new Ace Pro 2, but this is a good deal on what is still a great camera. Capable of recording up to 8K 24 fps, with solid stabilization, good color handling, and a Leica lens to boot, there's a lot to love here, especially for only $300. That said, unless you think you're going to use the 8K (which is really only usable in still shots, not action footage), the Osmo Action 4 deal above is a better value. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite 360 camera, Insta360's X4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), features a 1/2-inch sensor capable of 8K video, which is as high-resolution as you can get in a 360-degree camera. The 8K resolution means you can reframe your footage to fit rectangular video formats and still have high-quality clips sharp enough to mix with other sources. It doesn’t reframe to 4K (you'll have to wait for 12K footage before that's possible), but it's good enough for anything you'd put on social media. —Scott Gilbertson The Insta360 Go 3S (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is just plain fun. It's a hybrid camera that transforms from a traditional action-camera form factor to a more portable go-anywhere wearable camera. In action camera mode, it's much like the Ace Pro above. The sensor isn't as big so the image quality isn't as good, but you get the flip-up rear screen. The camera itself is waterproof to 33 feet (10 meters). The case can also continue to act as a remote monitor even when you pull the camera out. Couple that with the extremely strong magnetic mounting system on the camera pod, and the Go 3 becomes capable of shots and angles that no other action camera can match. —Scott Gilbertson If you want an instant camera and don't want to spend a lot, the Instax Mini 12 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is your best bet. It's a capable, easy-to-use camera wrapped in a colorful, bubbly design. One thing you'll find here that's missing even on more expensive models is parallax correction. That means you don't have to guess where the center of the frame is for close-up subjects. What you see is what you get, eliminating those accidentally ill-framed close-ups that sometimes happen with other instant cameras. —Scott Gilbertson The Sprocket Photo Printer offers the best results of the ink mini printers we've tested. It's roughly the size of a phone and connects with iPhone, iPad, or Android phones via Bluetooth. The mobile app lets you edit and customize your photos before printing. There's also an option to tile your images onto multiple prints for a larger, pieced-together image. —Scott Gilbertson The Polaroid Now+ has the typical features you'd expect from a Polaroid: vintage aesthetics, roll-out film, and a nice chunky body with easy-to-find buttons. What sets it apart is the smartphone companion app, which gives you the option to use features like Tripod Mode, Manual Mode, or setting a custom f-stop in Aperture Priority Mode. The Now+ also lets you take double exposures. It's pricey but it offers a good blend of modern methods and vintage execution. —Scott Gilbertson The Flir One Gen 3 is the largest of the thermal cameras we've tested. It’s about 2.6 inches wide and 1.3 inches tall, and it fits a lot into that space, including a built-in battery and two cameras. The first is the IF camera which captures 80 x 60-pixel images and then combines them with the second camera, which grabs a higher resolution image of visible light, which the device smooths and scales up to a nice, pretty clear, 1,440 x 1,080-pixel image. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite place to print photos is having a 30 percent off sale on its print services. Mpix makes high-quality prints at a reasonable price even when it's full price, which makes this a great deal. Mpix prints on Kodak Endura paper and offers a variety of paper options. I tested the E-surface, which renders rich, deep blacks and true-to-life colors. It holds up well over time; the images we printed in 2013 look exactly like they did when we got them. We also like Mpix's books and calendars. —Scott Gilbertson If you need to print gifts for your family, Shutterfly is having a sitewide 50 percent off sale. We're fans of Shutterfly's book printing service, which had the best results so far in our testing of photo printing services. We also like the calendars. The printing is good enough, especially for the price, and shipping is generally speedy. —Scott Gilbertson

SAN JOSE, Calif. & MIDLAND, Texas - Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDNS) and AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTS) have announced a collaboration focused on enhancing global connectivity through space-based cellular broadband, leveraging Cadence's design tools and AST SpaceMobile's satellite technology. The partnership has led to the development of the AST5000 ASIC, a custom chip designed to improve processing bandwidth by up to ten times per satellite. This advancement is a key component of AST SpaceMobile's BlueBird program, which aims to provide seamless, high-speed internet access from space to standard smartphones on Earth. While InvestingPro data shows the company's overall financial health score as 'Weak', it holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, suggesting financial flexibility for this innovative venture. Get access to 10+ additional ProTips and comprehensive analysis with InvestingPro's detailed research reports. Cadence's high-speed SerDes and other fundamental IP, along with their design enablement team, have allowed for significant power, performance, and area (PPA) optimizations in the system-on-chip (SoC), thereby enhancing the efficiency of the AST5000 ASIC. A critical phase of the collaboration was the utilization of Cadence’s Palladium® Emulation Platform, which facilitated pre-silicon development by validating and refining IP integration. This process ensured the integrity and performance of the final chip design. Huiwen Yao, chief technology officer at AST SpaceMobile, emphasized the importance of Cadence's industry-leading design solutions in overcoming the engineering challenges associated with building a reliable space-based cellular network. Boyd Phelps, senior vice president and general manager of the Silicon Solutions Group at Cadence, expressed excitement about contributing to a project that pushes the boundaries of satellite and mobile capabilities. AST SpaceMobile's BlueBird satellite is expected to support up to 10,000 MHz of processing bandwidth per satellite in the future, with potential data transmission speeds of up to 120 Mbps. This will enable voice calls, full data, and video applications on a cellular broadband network accessible to everyday smartphones. This collaboration aligns with Cadence's mission of enabling more efficient design cycles and hastening the journey towards a connected future. The information in this article is based on a press release statement. In other recent news, AST SpaceMobile, Inc. has been making significant strides in its mission to establish a global cellular broadband network in space. The company has successfully launched five Block 1 BlueBird satellites, the largest commercial phased array satellites in low Earth orbit, and is preparing to launch 25 more Block 2 satellites. The company has also secured launch agreements with Blue Origin and SpaceX for the years 2025 and 2026. AST SpaceMobile's CEO, Abel Avellan, has recently entered into a variable prepaid forward contract, a strategic move approved by the company's Board of Directors. This non-dilutive transaction accounts for approximately 3.2% of Mr. Avellan's total holdings and less than 1% of the company's total Class A common stock. The company has also reported a substantial increase in cash reserves to $518.9 million. In addition to these financial developments, AST SpaceMobile is negotiating commercial agreements with major partners like AT&T and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and the company plans to expand its ground infrastructure in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Despite an increase in estimated direct material and launch costs per satellite, the company remains confident in its growth trajectory.

Title: Collect 12% Yields By Investing Like A Billionaire In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2024/12/03/collect-12-yields-by-investing-like-a-billionaire-in-2025/

Full Content:
Senior businessman in suit flying in private jet and listening to music via wireless earphones. If you’ve been investing for a while, you’ve probably thought about private equity more than once. Adding exposure to “PE” firms, which buy and sell privately held businesses, is a great way to diversify beyond the big names of the S&P 500. But of course, to get in on that action, we have to be either institutional investors or have a net worth high enough to be “accredited.” Most people stop there. But there is a way to access private equity through a kind of lesser-known “back door.” For example, you could buy an ETF like the Invesco Global Listed Private Equity ETF (PSP) right on the stock market. The fund holds publicly traded PE firms like Blackstone, KKR & Co. (KKR) and the Carlyle Group (CG). It’s also had a pretty decent run, with a 9.1% annualized return over the last decade. More recently, though, PSP’s returns have been a bit weaker, reflecting a PE market recovering from its overvaluation in 2021. PSP Total Returns However, private equity is recovering in 2024, with a year-to-date return above 25% both for PSP and the index on which it’s based: the S&P Global Listed Private Equity Index. That makes now an interesting time to invest in the PE space. But we can do better than PSP and its 2.9% yield (an annualized calculation based on the fund’s latest quarterly distribution) with the double-digit yielders I’ll show you in a bit. Doing so means we can use the higher cash flow to pay our bills and become more financially independent, of course. But a large income stream has a different function when it comes to private equity. Since this market can be highly volatile, a high dividend ensures we’re getting more of our return in cash, and at regular intervals. We can then either use these funds to diversify away from private equity or buy more at a bargain when the market turns against these assets. This is better than what most people do: Sell a bigger portion of their low-yielding “regular” stocks to generate cash. Trouble is, it’s easy to give in to emotion and do this more during bear markets, when it’s the worst time to do so financially. With that in mind, there are two closed-end funds (CEFs) with big parts of their portfolios in private equity that are compelling here: the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ), which yields 13% as I write this, and the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), with a 12.1% yield. BIGZ has about a quarter of its assets in private equity, and BSTZ is closer to a third. Both funds mainly focus the rest of their holdings on tech companies, like NVIDIA (NVDA) and chipmaker Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), that are themselves exposed to private firms through their vendors and customers. This diversification has helped both funds recover strongly since the 2022 selloff, with the last year showing particularly strong returns for BSTZ (in purple below). That’s partly because it devotes more of its portfolio to private equity. BSTZ/BIGZ Total Returns In total, BIGZ’s private equity investments have seen a 44.1% decrease in their value on average, since the fund’s inception in 2021 (you can see a breakdown of the performance of BIGZ’s PE holdings and those of BSTZ here, on pages 9 and 14, respectively). This also explains why BIGZ trades at a 10.2% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio) today. Management is just not doing the best job on the PE side. BSTZ, meantime, has had a positive 30.9% return on its PE investments, but that’s going back to late 2019, since the fund is older. This is clearly much better, which explains why BSTZ’s discount to NAV is much smaller than that of BIGZ, at 7.3%. Plus, BSTZ’s 12.1% dividend gives you more control over your investment than you’d have if you just bought PSP, the private-equity ETF we mentioned earlier. Plus—and this is the real key here—BSTZ’s performance is getting better over time as the PE market recovers, which may be why the CEF (in orange below) has been outrunning PSP lately: BSTZ Outperforms That makes BSTZ the best buy here—not just for the PE exposure and the 12.1% income stream, but also because we can still get in at a decent discount as private equity continues to recover.

Title: Stock market today: S&P 500, Nasdaq futures hold just short of records with JOLTS on deck

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures drifted near all-time highs on Tuesday as investors waited for fresh jobs data and Fedspeak to cement or dent growing hopes for interest-rate cuts. Futures on the S&P 500 (ES=F) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) were down around 0.1%, coming off fresh records for the indexes. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) traded broadly flat. Investors are bracing for a reading later on JOLTS job openings in October, the first in a wave of key data this week that culminates in Friday's all-important monthly US payrolls report. The watch is on for signs of a soft landing for the economy, which will shape views on the path of rates — especially after Federal Reserve officials hinted that they're still open to a December cut. Traders are now pricing in about a 73% chance that the Fed lowers rates by a quarter percentage point at its Dec. 18 meeting, compared with 62% a day ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Those odds could shift after appearances by Fed policymakers Austan Goolsbee and Adriana Kugler later Tuesday, which set the stage for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's panel discussion on Wednesday. On the corporate front, Tesla (TSLA) stock slipped in pre-market trading after shipments of the EV maker's China-built models fell again, putting sales targets in doubt. In addition, CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay deal was rejected again by a judge. Meanwhile, shares in US Steel (X) fell over 8% on the heels of President-elect Donald Trump's promise to "block" its $15 billion takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel (5401.T, NPSCY). Trump said tax incentives and tariffs will enable the American steel giant to thrive on its own. Political turmoil in France is also attracting market attention, with the government on the brink of collapse as its faces a parliamentary vote. With Germany also set for a snap election after a government breakdown, Wall Street is keeping a close eye on the two pillars of the EU. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Lots of analysis on the CEO shake-up at Intel (INTC) has been released, but indeed this is NOT a one day story. The path forward for Intel is vitally important for the country — the chip supply chain must be diversified beyond the singular reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). But that path forward for Intel will be brutal, at best. Here are a couple good points this morning out of EvercoreISI analyst Mark Lipacis: "We see multiple challenges for INTC, regardless of the CEO: 1) the computing center of gravity is drifting away from x86 in the datacenter to GPUs, and at the edge to ARM, 2) INTC is not only competing with AMD (AMD), but also Nvidia (NVDA) and its own customers making custom CPU and AI processors, 3) INTC has continued to lose share in servers and desktops, although it has stabilized share in notebooks. Some of my initial insight on Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger's departure down below. Billionaire Jeff Bezos is throwing his weight behind a computing company that’s coming for Nvidia’s (NVDA) dominance of the artificial intelligence chip market. Since leaving his post as Microsoft CEO in 2000, Bill Gates has become one of the world's most visible philanthropists. He does most of his charitable giving through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which manages an estimated $45 billion ... Art Cashin, a renowned market pundit and the UBS director of floor operations at the New York Stock Exchange, has died at the age of 83, UBS said. Cashin, once dubbed "Wall Street's version of Walter Cronkite" by The Washington Post, was a regular on CNBC, delivering stock market commentary and analysis to the business news channel's viewers for more than 25 years. "It is with a heavy heart that I inform you of the passing of Arthur Cashin, Jr., a true giant in our industry," Bill Carroll, head of sales and development at UBS Wealth Management USA, said in a memo sent to employees on Monday. Meta stock could be one of the best buys in the artificial intelligence industry right now. Now, let's consider one of the highest-profile companies today, and that's artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). In fact, Nvidia just completed its most recent stock split in June after the shares soared past $900 earlier in the year -- and then surged past $1,000 after Nvidia's announcement of the split. Is it possible that Nvidia, so soon after that operation, could decide to launch another stock split? The past couple of years have been terrific for stocks, with the benchmark S&P 500 index up a whopping 57.1% since the end of 2022. The average stock in the S&P 500 index offers a yield of just 1.2%, but Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), W.P. Carey (NYSE: WPC), and Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE: OHI) offer more than 6% at recent prices. Here's why adding them to a diversified portfolio now makes a lot of sense for most income-seeking investors. Here's how much Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is worth as he steps down from the helm of the chipmaker, whose shares have lost around 61% of their value during his tenure. Supermicro shares jumped nearly 30% Monday after the server maker announced that an independent review of its accounting practices found no wrongdoing. Monitor these key chart levels. Is today's big Archer Aviation sell-off a buying opportunity for investors worried about missing out on the stock? Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock soared after the server maker announced that an independent review of its business found no evidence of fraud or misconduct. Sign in to access your portfolio

MIAMI, Dec. 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Defiance ETFs today launched NVOX, the world's first single-stock leveraged ETF for the pharmaceutical stock Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NYSE:NVO). As the weight loss market continues to expand and Novo Nordisk is a key provider in that space, NVOX offers retail investors 2X daily long leveraged exposure to the change in the daily share price of Novo Nordisk without the need for a margin account. This provides a unique tool for tactical traders. NVOX does not invest directly in Novo Nordisk and has a higher degree of risk due to tracking a single stock. Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark, seeking to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases, built upon their heritage in diabetes. The company does so by pioneering scientific breakthroughs, expanding access to their medicines, and working to prevent and ultimately cure disease. Novo Nordisk employs about 69,000 people in 80 countries and markets its products in around 170 countries. "For investors who want to gain enhanced exposure to the share price movement of Novo Nordisk stock, NVOX is a great choice, said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO of Defiance ETFs. As people worldwide are losing weight using products like Ozempic and Wegovy, their maker Novo Nordisk represents a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity, and we are excited to provide investors with a groundbreaking trading tool to participate in this transformative sector." About Defiance ETFs Founded in 2018, Defiance stands as a leading ETF issuer dedicated to income and thematic investing. Defiance also pioneers leveraged ETFs designed for traders seeking tactical opportunities. Our suite of first-mover leveraged & thematic ETFs empowers investors to express targeted views on disruptive innovations, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum computing, while our actively managed options ETFs are designed to seek current income. Important Disclosures The fund attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to two times (200%) the share price performance of an underlying exchange-traded fund (an Underlying Security). The Fund is not intended to be used by, and are not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. The Fund is very different from most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The Fund's investment adviser will not attempt to position a Fund's portfolio to ensure that the Fund does not gain or lose more than a maximum percentage of its net asset value on a given trading day. As a consequence, if an Underlying Security's share price referenced by a Fund decreases by more than 50% on a given trading day, the corresponding Fund's investors could lose all of their money. NVOX Disclosure: Defiance ETFs LLC is the ETF sponsor. The Fund's investment adviser is Tidal Investments, LLC (Tidal or the Adviser). The Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other important information about the investment company. Please read the prospectus and / or summary prospectus carefully before investing. Hard copies can be requested by calling 833.333.9383. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. As an ETF, the funds may trade at a premium or discount to NAV. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. A portfolio concentrated in a single industry or country, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. There is no guarantee that the Fund's investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment. Total (EPA:TTEF) return represents changes to the NAV and accounts for distributions from the fund. Median 30 Day Spread is a calculation of Fund's median bid-ask spread, expressed as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth, computed by: identifying the Fund's national best bid and national best offer as of the end of each 10 second interval during each trading day of the last 30 calendar days; dividing the difference between each such bid and offer by the midpoint of the national best bid and national best offer; and identifying the median of those values. Underlying Security Risk. The underlying security is subject to many risks that can negatively impact the Fund. Indirect Investment in NVO Nordisk Risk. NVO Nordisk is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, or the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way and has no obligation to consider your Shares in taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of Shares. NVO Trading Risk. The trading price of the Underlying Security may exhibit volatility and significant fluctuations due to various factors inherent in the semiconductor industry. This sector is susceptible to price and volume fluctuations, which may not always correlate with the companies' operational performance. Short sellers may exert influence on trading dynamics, potentially impacting supply and demand dynamics and contributing to market price volatility. NVO Performance Risk. NVO may fail to meet its publicly announced guidelines or other expectations about its business, which could cause the price of NVO to decline. NVO provides guidance regarding its expected financial and business performance, such as projections regarding sales and production, as well as anticipated future revenues, gross margins, profitability and cash flows. Pharmaceutical (TADAWUL:2070) Industry Risks. Pharmaceutical research and development are very costly and highly uncertain; NVO may not succeed in developing, licensing, or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies. NVO and NVO's products face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on NVO's business. Fixed Income Securities Risk. When the Fund invests in fixed income securities, the value of your investment in the Fund will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities owned by the Fund. Leverage Risk. Leverage may increase the risk of loss and cause fluctuations in the market value of the Fund's portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the NAV of the Fund generally to decline faster than it would otherwise. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks. Foreign and Emerging Markets Risks. Investments in foreign securities may involve risks such as social and political instability, market illiquidity, exchange-rate fluctuations, a high level of volatility and limited regulation. Investing in emerging markets involves different and greater risks, as these countries are substantially smaller, less liquid and more volatile than securities markets in more developed markets. Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk. The Fund has a daily leveraged investment objective and the Fund's performance for periods greater than a trading day will be the result of each day's returns compounded over the period, which is very likely to differ from the Fund performance, before fees and expenses. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security, may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Swap Agreements. The use of swap transactions is a highly specialized activity, which involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. These risks may prevent the Fund from achieving its leveraged investment objective, even if the Underlying Security later reverses all or a portion of its movement. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in derivatives which exposes the Fund to the risk that the counterparty will not fulfill its obligation to the Fund. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is non-diversified, it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. As a result, a decline in the value of an investment in a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers could cause the Fund's overall value to decline to a greater degree than if the Fund held a more diversified portfolio. New Fund Risk. As of the date of this prospectus, the Fund has no operating history and currently has fewer assets than larger funds. Like other new funds, large inflows and outflows may impact the Fund's market exposure for limited periods of time. Diversification does not ensure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market. Brokerage Commissions may be charged on trades. NVOX is distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.

Investments in foreign securities may involve risks such as social and political instability, market illiquidity, exchange-rate fluctuations, a high level of volatility and limited regulation. Investing in emerging markets involves different and greater risks, as these countries are substantially smaller, less liquid and more volatile than securities markets in more developed markets. Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk. The Fund has a daily leveraged investment objective and the Fund's performance for periods greater than a trading day will be the result of each day's returns compounded over the period, which is very likely to differ from the Fund performance, before fees and expenses. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security, may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Swap Agreements. The use of swap transactions is a highly specialized activity, which involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. These risks may prevent the Fund from achieving its leveraged investment objective, even if the Underlying Security later reverses all or a portion of its movement. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in derivatives which exposes the Fund to the risk that the counterparty will not fulfill its obligation to the Fund. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is non-diversified, it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. As a result, a decline in the value of an investment in a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers could cause the Fund's overall value to decline to a greater degree than if the Fund held a more diversified portfolio. New Fund Risk. As of the date of this prospectus, the Fund has no operating history and currently has fewer assets than larger funds. Like other new funds, large inflows and outflows may impact the Fund's market exposure for limited periods of time. Diversification does not ensure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market. Brokerage Commissions may be charged on trades. NVOX is distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.

As the weight loss market continues to expand and Novo Nordisk is a key provider in that space, NVOX offers retail investors 2X daily long leveraged exposure to the change in the daily share price of Novo Nordisk without the need for a margin account. This provides a unique tool for tactical traders. NVOX does not invest directly in Novo Nordisk and has a higher degree of risk due to tracking a single stock. Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark, seeking to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases, built upon their heritage in diabetes. The company does so by pioneering scientific breakthroughs, expanding access to their medicines, and working to prevent and ultimately cure disease.

"For investors who want to gain enhanced exposure to the share price movement of Novo Nordisk stock, NVOX is a great choice, said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO of Defiance ETFs.

Important Disclosures The fund attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to two times (200%) the share price performance of an underlying exchange-traded fund (an Underlying Security). The Fund is not intended to be used by, and are not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. The Fund is very different from most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The Fund's investment adviser will not attempt to position a Fund's portfolio to ensure that the Fund does not gain or lose more than a maximum percentage of its net asset value on a given trading day. As a consequence, if an Underlying Security's share price referenced by a Fund decreases by more than 50% on a given trading day, the corresponding Fund's investors could lose all of their money. NVOX Disclosure: Defiance ETFs LLC is the ETF sponsor. The Fund's investment adviser is Tidal Investments, LLC (Tidal or the Adviser). The Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other important information about the investment company. Please read the prospectus and / or summary prospectus carefully before investing. Hard copies can be requested by calling 833.333.9383. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. As an ETF, the funds may trade at a premium or discount to NAV. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. A portfolio concentrated in a single industry or country, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. There is no guarantee that the Fund's investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment. Total (EPA:TTEF) return represents changes to the NAV and accounts for distributions from the fund. Median 30 Day Spread is a calculation of Fund's median bid-ask spread, expressed as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth, computed by: identifying the Fund's national best bid and national best offer as of the end of each 10 second interval during each trading day of the last 30 calendar days; dividing the difference between each such bid and offer by the midpoint of the national best bid and national best offer; and identifying the median of those values. Underlying Security Risk. The underlying security is subject to many risks that can negatively impact the Fund. Indirect Investment in NVO Nordisk Risk. NVO Nordisk is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, or the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way and has no obligation to consider your Shares in taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of Shares. NVO Trading Risk. The trading price of the Underlying Security may exhibit volatility and significant fluctuations due to various factors inherent in the semiconductor industry. This sector is susceptible to price and volume fluctuations, which may not always correlate with the companies' operational performance. Short sellers may exert influence on trading dynamics, potentially impacting supply and demand dynamics and contributing to market price volatility. NVO Performance Risk. NVO may fail to meet its publicly announced guidelines or other expectations about its business, which could cause the price of NVO to decline. NVO provides guidance regarding its expected financial and business performance, such as projections regarding sales and production, as well as anticipated future revenues, gross margins, profitability and cash flows. Pharmaceutical (TADAWUL:2070) Industry Risks. Pharmaceutical research and development are very costly and highly uncertain; NVO may not succeed in developing, licensing, or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies. NVO and NVO's products face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on NVO's business. Fixed Income Securities Risk. When the Fund invests in fixed income securities, the value of your investment in the Fund will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities owned by the Fund. Leverage Risk. Leverage may increase the risk of loss and cause fluctuations in the market value of the Fund's portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the NAV of the Fund generally to decline faster than it would otherwise. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks. Foreign and Emerging Markets Risks. Investments in foreign securities may involve risks such as social and political instability, market illiquidity, exchange-rate fluctuations, a high level of volatility and limited regulation. Investing in emerging markets involves different and greater risks, as these countries are substantially smaller, less liquid and more volatile than securities markets in more developed markets.

Title: Pat Gelsinger and Carlos Tavares had the same big problem: Morning Brief

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The corporate world kicked off December with two big CEO departures. And both departures share an important commonality that almost no corporate executive can overcome, particularly in a bull market: Their company's stock price was in the basement. Stellantis (STLA) CEO Carlos Tavares quit on Sunday following a clash with the company's board. Meanwhile, Intel (INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger retired on Sunday in a move that was not entirely up to him. So far this year, Stellantis stock has lost 47%; Intel stock is down over 50%. And this in a year where the S&P 500 is up over 25%. No matter the track record of the CEO or the soundness of a turnaround plan, it is hard to underperform the S&P 500 by 60-plus percentage points in a single year and retain the benefit of the doubt from your board of directors. To wit, 2024 is pacing to have a record number of CEOs out of a job. Both executives were longtime industry leaders who had built their reputations over decades, navigating the ebbs and flows of the auto and semiconductor industries, respectively. Both men were tasked with trying to stabilize and turn around legacy brands facing existential challenges. And now, both are out of a job. Reporting from Reuters on Monday suggested Tavares's split with his board of directors came over a turnaround plan the board felt was too focused on cost cuts. Gelsinger's schism with his board emerged, among other things, over the scale of investments that may never pan out for Intel, a source told Yahoo Finance. But as Michael Farr, chief market strategist for Hightower Advisors, told Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban on Monday, "If a company’s figurative boat is sinking while most others are enjoying a rising tide, corrective action must be taken by the CEO and or the Board." Over the last decade, however, the idea of shareholder primacy has come under some scrutiny as the ESG movement put particular pressure on the idea that corporations should serve shareholder interests over everything else, with the stock price as the scoreboard for the company. And, of course, for the CEO. In 2019, for instance, the Business Roundtable announced nearly 200 CEOs had signed a new statement of purpose saying companies will be led "for the benefit of all stakeholders — customers, employees, supplier, communities and shareholders." Earlier this year, the Business Roundtable reiterated its support for this stance as investors and corporations start to abandon diversity pledges and other ESG-related plans. But in many ways, the Business Roundtable's push was late. Google famously said in its S-1 back in 2004 that its leaders "aspire to make Google an institution that makes the world a better place." Facebook said in its 2011 S-1, "Our mission is to make the world more open and connected." The notion that a company would stand for more than its income statement isn't new, novel, or going away. And neither Tavares nor Gelsinger had strategic pillars that were outside the bounds of what might be considered generically shareholder-friendly — control costs, enter new markets, and keep pace with industrywide trends. It's just that both Google and Facebook — now Alphabet and Meta Platforms, respectively — have more than earned the benefit of the doubt from investors that their company can stand for whatever its leaders want it to stand for. Since its IPO in 2004, Google stock has gained over 6,000% and its parent company, Alphabet, has a market cap of $2.1 trillion. Since going public in 2012, Meta stock has risen over 1,400%. Its market cap is nearly $1.5 trillion. Working "for the benefit of all stakeholders," then, seems to be something that is earned, not given to employees. Because there remains little doubt about who ranks first in that hierarchy.

Title: The business dynamics of London, Blair, and the crisis in France, the truth about the Parthenon marbles (good news), the diplomatic incident with Douzoglou and the Royal house of Morocco

Greetings! Yesterday’s news comes from London, where the Prime Minister has been since Saturday, holding meetings with foreign investors and taking the opportunity to connect with Greek businesspeople, bankers, and various influential figures who inevitably show up whenever they sense proximity to power. Fair enough, it’s not a bad thing—after all, the Prime Minister always draws a crowd. Even if Mr. Doudonis doesn’t like it, as he pointed out on TV yesterday (SKAI), saying, “And who exactly is Mitsotakis, wanting a third term? He’s not George Washington…”—only to be reminded by the journalists of the late Andreas Papandreou, who did serve a third term. Now, you’ll find more details about London’s business matters below, but I’d like to say a few words about the famous issue of the Parthenon Marbles, which has resurfaced in recent days. The truth is that the PM’s office prefers to keep this matter out of the limelight for now, and understandably so. “It’s not the right time, and it’s harmful to us. Plus, it’s not tactful towards the new British Prime Minister to bring it up, since formally, it’s not his decision,” my source says. However, from another non-governmental source, I know that progress is being made. A formula is being sought whereby the Parthenon Marbles will return permanently, but without the British officially saying they’ve been “returned for good,” and without us agreeing to any term like “loan” in the deal. Remember that in March 2023, the Vatican, under the Pope’s directive, returned three fragments from the Parthenon’s northern frieze to Athens, now housed in the Acropolis Museum. It’s even speculated that these fragments might have been part of the same shipment as the Marbles looted by Lord Elgin, now held in the British Museum. If the plan moves forward, Greece will loan a significant archaeological artifact every six months to be displayed where the Parthenon Marbles once stood. The Prime Minister, K.M., fielded many questions during the closed session of Morgan Stanley’s event, attended by numerous corporate executives. I hear much of the discussion focused on political stability, as the City is concerned about developments in Europe, especially with France’s turbulence and Germany heading for early elections. “Greece faces no risk of political instability; we have a stable government,” K.M. assured them, emphasizing that his administration’s policies are delivering results despite Europe’s sluggish growth. Naturally, they also inquired about the government’s stance on banks, with K.M. shutting down any talk of a windfall tax on bank profits. Under new EU rules, such revenues can’t be funneled into social programs. The Prime Minister also mentioned the Thessaloniki Metro, saying, “If I wanted to describe my vision for Greece, I’d use the Thessaloniki Metro as an example. It’s an impressive public project that overcame numerous obstacles, facing resistance from all kinds of forces. It’s a state-of-the-art metro system that preserves our cultural heritage. For me, this represents the Greece of the future.” K.M. spent about 2.5 hours at a closed session organized by former Prime Minister Tony Blair’s institute, focusing on artificial intelligence. He was accompanied by Akis Skertsos and Dimitris Papastergiou, while Tony Blair had assembled an impressive group, including 2024 Chemistry Nobel Laureate Demis Hassabis, whose heritage is half Cypriot and half Singaporean. The discussion covered practical applications of AI, with a presentation of an incubator set up on Downing Street, featuring 20 scientists offering solutions across various fields. Both sides agreed on closer cooperation, as the Greek government seeks expertise in areas like healthcare services (e.g., triage), prescription management, agriculture, and road safety. At the Morgan Stanley conference, Evangelos Mytilineos stood out for his critical stance on European policies that overlook the real needs of citizens and businesses. He commented on the diminished role of the EU, which no longer plays a significant part in shaping global developments. He attributed this decline to a power struggle between soft and hard power politics, noting that Europe excelled in the former but is ill-prepared for the era of hard power. He questioned whether the aging continent could once again lead in innovation. The conference hall erupted in laughter when an investor asked whether the crisis in France and the collapse of the German government might impact the Greek economy. Someone wryly noted that 10-15 years ago, the conversation was the exact opposite—everyone was wondering if Greece’s crisis would affect Germany and France. Beyond the packed schedule, Prime Minister K.M. had a private dinner with Tony Blair last night. It’s said that Blair holds Mitsotakis in high regard, personally appreciating him. Blair perhaps sees in Mitsotakis a reflection of his own “Third Way” political model, which he implemented as Prime Minister. However, after his meetings with Morgan Stanley, discussions on artificial intelligence, and a sit-down with Keir Starmer, K.M. is set to return to Greek politics for talks with Nikos Androulakis on Wednesday. Yesterday, I mentioned the ongoing troubles of Venezuelan-born businessman Theodoros Douzoglou with the Anti-Money Laundering Authority, which remain in full swing. Today, I’ll recount a wild incident that nearly escalated into a full-fledged diplomatic episode. Last July, Queen Lalla Salma of Morocco, the first wife of King Mohammed VI (their marital status remains unclear), visited Mykonos with their eldest son, the heir to the throne, and other members of the royal family. A well-known hotel company arranged for their accommodation in some of Douzoglou’s villas in Agios Lazaros, Mykonos, due to unavailability in its own facilities. Trouble began when Douzoglou discovered that such high-profile guests were staying in his villas. He demanded additional payment from the hotel company. While this could have been settled as a simple civil dispute, things escalated. On the day of the royal family’s departure, shortly after the family members had left, black-clad men resembling bodyguards blocked the villas and prevented the royal staff from retrieving their luggage. The incident quickly reached the government via diplomatic channels, and the Greek police (ELAS) arrived within minutes. High-level orders were clear: “Anyone obstructing the royal family’s departure is to be arrested on the spot.” The mysterious men promptly disappeared, and the situation was resolved. However, the incident remains on record at the Mykonos police station. Is Greece turning into Venezuela? Following a column’s mention of potential misuse of a provision allowing Golden Visas for properties worth at least €250,000, provided they involve industrial buildings converted into residences, PASOK MP Milena Apostolaki submitted a related query to Finance Minister Kostis Hatzidakis. She noted a trend, particularly in Attica, where industrial properties are subdivided and repurposed as residential units, sold for €250,000 to third-country nationals, enabling them to acquire Golden Visas under advantageous terms. The double denial by the Prime Minister of rumors regarding a new windfall tax on banks and energy profits, coupled with the decline in 10-year bond yields (2.883%)—lower than France’s 2.921%—and the dividends announced by TERNA Energy, provided a solid boost to the stock market yesterday. A total of 34.3 million shares were traded, with 29.61 million involving the banking sector. The Banking Index surged by 4.61%, marking its best daily performance since November 14, 2023. The General Index, buoyed by the banking sector, remained positive throughout and closed at 1,424.33 points (+2.21%). It wasn’t just bank stocks that saw impressive gains. Metlen rose by 3.73% to €32.22, PPC hit €11.77 (+2.79%), TITAN hovered near €40 (€39.8, +2.71%), with BIOHALCO, HelleniQ Energy, and Motor Oil (back above €20) all contributing to the festive mood. Aegean (+2.32%) and Coca Cola (+1.91%) also added to the optimism, setting a target of 1,500 points for the index. The situation at Hellenic Defense Systems (EAS) is growing increasingly complex, making solutions harder to find. Today marks the rescheduled General Assembly of EAS shareholders, primarily the Ministry of Finance, overseen by the Ministry of Defense. The current board’s term ended on Sunday, December 1, and CEO Nikos Kostopoulos, the longest-serving CEO in EAS history, has not indicated plans for renewal. Meanwhile, company accounts are frozen pending the new board’s appointment. The assembly will decide on the new CEO, board members, and a capital increase. Regarding objections raised by ONEX over a strategic partnership between EAS and Slovakian (Czech-backed) company MSM Export for a European-funded project called ASAP, the Council of State was set to hear the case today but postponed its decision to March 18, 2025. If this date holds, March could stretch into summer—who knows what will unfold by then? Last week, EAS paid MSM Export €4 million for their ASAP share, raising questions about the legality of the payment pending the Council’s ruling. How this Gordian knot will be untangled remains to be seen. In football, Italian teams often retreat to a hotel or training center before big matches for a “ritiro” (from ritirare, meaning to withdraw), a practice that frequently delivers results. This approach is now finding its way into the corporate world. OTE plans to hold its own ritiro at a well-known Peloponnesian hotel, gathering department heads and the new leadership under Kostas Nebis, who took over a few months ago. This retreat aims to solidify the team as they execute their new strategy, set for 2030. As Nebis recently explained to journalists, this strategy rests on three pillars: growth, diversification, and transformation—focusing on improving customer service and operational efficiency. One of Greece’s largest electronics retailers advertised a camera for Black Friday with a 36% discount at €1,999, down from €3,119. However, a price history check revealed the camera cost €3,119 only last January, while in October it was priced at €2,299, making the real discount just 13%. “Fine print,” you might say, but there’s more: a TV was touted as selling for €548, the year’s lowest price, yet on September 17, it was priced at €483. “The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree,” goes the saying, which fits the case of Matilda-Maria Kalliniku, daughter of Goldair Group head Kallinikos Kalliniku and Regina Golemi. The 22-year-old serves as President and CEO of the newly established “TIP TAP Solutions S.A.,” headquartered on Amalias Avenue. With an initial capital of €25,000, the company will offer services in financial intermediation, transaction processing, software development, electronic systems management, business consulting, and market research. Kallinikos Kalliniku holds the position of Vice President, while Regina Golemi completes the three-member board. Various scenarios are circulating in the market about the identity and intentions of the systematic and cautious buyer of shares in the Piraeus Port Authority. One theory points to a fund from across the Atlantic. Another suggests a major hotel group, which is either interested in or has already agreed to participate in Cosco’s €800 million investment plan. This plan includes the construction of a five-star hotel, three four-star hotels, commercial spaces, and a logistics center within the cruise passenger terminal. The main focus of this investment is the transformation of the iconic “Pagoda” building into a five-star hotel, a landmark for the area. Donald Trump has openly and bluntly declared economic war against BRICS countries. He warned—via “X” (formerly Twitter)—that nations aligning with BRICS to move away from the dollar will face 100% tariffs and must forget about exporting to the U.S. This marks the first time in history that a U.S. president has threatened 100% tariffs on imports from nine countries simultaneously. BRICS, which began in 2011 with Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, expanded this year to include Iran, the UAE, Ethiopia, and Egypt. Additionally, 34 more countries have expressed interest in joining. Trump’s warning seemingly targets them too. Simply put, global trade, as we knew it, is over. The S&P 500 index remained consistently above 6,000 points, finishing last Friday with the highest monthly gains of the past year. It’s no secret that this stellar performance is driven by the “Magnificent Seven” (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla). Since the start of 2023, these seven companies have rallied by 148%, while the other 493 S&P 500 companies rose by 35% during the same period. The overall index gained 57%, nearly three times less than the tech giants. The combined market capitalization of the “Magnificent Seven” has reached $16 trillion, equaling the total capitalization of the German, French, British, and Canadian stock exchanges. For now, “divide and conquer” is working in Europe’s favor regarding oil prices. During the last week of November, Brent crude and U.S. crude prices dropped by over 3%. This trend seems set to continue in global markets. Non-OPEC oil producers (e.g., the U.S., Canada, Guyana, and Brazil) are ignoring OPEC’s decisions and ramping up production. Meanwhile, major consumers like China are reducing demand due to the rise of electric vehicles and a slowing economy. The International Energy Agency predicts a surplus of over 1 million barrels per day. OPEC countries will meet this Thursday in a desperate bid to coordinate policies, as oil prices seem unlikely to rise above $80, staying within the $70-$75 range. Explore related questions

Title: Salinas Loses $5.5 Billion in a Day on Elektra Slump
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/salinas-loses-5-5-billion-in-a-day-on-elektra-slump-11733177662836.html
Time Published: 2024-12-02T22:14:22Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Grupo Elektra tumbled 71% on Monday as trading resumed following a months-long halt, wiping off $5.5 billion from the fortune of billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego and pushing him out of the world’s top 500 wealthiest list. Shares of Elektra ended the session at 274.27 pesos per share compared to a 944.95 price where they last traded in July. Bolsa Mexicana de Valores said in a filing early Monday that it had been asked by regulators to let the stock trade even it blew past circuit breakers in the premarket auction — a mechanism which had barred it from resuming for days. Trading resumed even as Elektra said in a statement before market open that it had a court order keeping it blocked, adding that anyone dealing in the stock could be held responsible. “It is our obligation to reiterate that the resumption of trading in these, in addition to causing irreparable damage, could involve shares obtained improperly,” Grupo Salinas spokesman Luciano Pascoe said in a response to questions. 4-Month Halt Salinas himself had triggered the trading halt back in July, alleging he was a victim of potential fraud. His lawyers claimed a creditor had used the company’s shares to fund a $110 million loan, and later discovered most of the shares appeared to have been sold, pushing the stock price down. The rest, they say, was pocketed by the creditor, who has denied any wrongdoing. “It is important to remember that any eventual consequences are the exclusive responsibility of their buyers and sellers,” Pascoe said. After a month of no trading, Elektra got booted from the country’s main stock gauge. Now, it’s facing selling pressure from exchange-traded funds managed by BlackRock Inc and The Vanguard Group, which need to dump shares. Volume on Monday surged to a more than seven year high. Officials had been trying for days to lift the halt, but the low bids immediately triggered a market circuit breaker designed to limit volatility, suspending it again. Lawyers for Salinas had argued to keep the stock from trading, saying it would cause “irreparable damage to the company.” $5.5 Billion Salinas’ nearly 75% stake in the company is now worth about $2.2 billion, down from $7.6 billion on Friday. That gives him a net worth of $5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Salinas, 69, has long been the third-wealthiest Mexican behind Carlos Slim and German Larrea. Heading into this week, he was ranked the world’s 262nd-richest-person by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. With the plunge, Salinas is no longer on the list of the 500 wealthiest people. Beyond Salinas’ stake, ETFs and other index-tracking funds hold around 4 million in shares out of 47.8 million in free floating shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the slump is vaporizing Salinas’ wealth on paper — which had been a key fixture of his ability to take loans out against Elektra’s value — it could make a bid to de-list the shares easier. Elektra said last week it would hold a meeting in late December to discuss taking the company private. --With assistance from Carolina Wilson.

Title: Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Among Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Top Stock Picks Heading Into 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Ken Fisher's other top stock picks. Ken Fisher is the founder of Fisher Asset Management, a financial adviser that he started nearly five decades ago. The firm oversees over $240 billion from more than 150,000 private investors. Fisher said, "I've gone to cash three times in my career; in 1987 before the crash, before the 1990 bear market and in the early 2000s, before the dot-com crash. But I missed the 2007-2009 bear market because I didn't believe, and don't believe, mortgages could cause what they are blamed for having caused." Besides focusing on long-term investments, Fisher also believes in spreading out investments to reduce risk. Fisher Asset Management is highly diversified, with a portfolio value of about $244 billion. While technology stocks account for 31.8% of the portfolio, the independent money management firm is also heavily invested in the services sector, accounting for 14.6% of the portfolio. Other significant holdings are in the financial services, healthcare, and basic materials sectors. In the past year, Fisher's firm made a 32.18% return, mainly because it invested a lot in tech stocks, especially those benefiting from the AI boom. While other managers are selling tech stocks due to high valuations, Fisher's firm is buying more, especially in companies making AI chips. READ ALSO: 8 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and 99% of Billionaire Abrams’ Portfolio is in These 11 Stocks. Even though the overall market is at all-time highs, Fisher says there's no need to worry. He believes that just because the market is high now, it doesn't predict the future. He expects the market to keep going up as long as the economy and other key factors get better. "Bull markets hit new highs on an ongoing basis as soon as they have recovered from the prior bear market and hit their first all-time high in that new bull market. They keep doing that over and over again and eventually you do get another bear market and then again get another bull market. Bull markets, not always, are usually significantly bigger and longer than bear markets, significantly," Ken Fisher said. Ken Fisher's portfolio is heavily invested in the "magnificent seven" stocks, based on the belief that the stocks are well poised to continue outperforming the overall market. According to Fisher, growth stocks will continue outperforming value stocks amid the prevailing economic conditions. "If you think the market is going up, you should expect the magnificent seven to continue to do well. Will they necessarily do better than everything? No, but they never actually did. The fact is they did better as a group than most groups you could find. I think that will continue to be the case because I am optimistic on the market as a whole moving forward", Fisher said in a video interview. Our Methodology We looked through Fisher Asset Management's portfolio to find Ken Fisher's top 15 stock picks for 2025. We focused on his biggest investments and ranked the stocks from smallest to largest based on the firm's stake at the end of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Fisher Asset Management’s Equity Stake: $8.32 Billion Number of Hedge Funds Holding Stakes: 286 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a company that built its name as a retail giant on the sale of consumer products and advertising. It has since diversified its business empire with investments in cloud computing and the sale of electronic devices. About 38% of online sales in the US happen in the company's online store. Consequently, the company is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of e-commerce industry sales. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is succeeding in fending off competition in online sales. The launch of ultra-cheap products through Amazon Haul has strengthened its edge in attracting more sales through the mobile-only marketplace. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also boasts the largest cloud computing unit. Amazon Web Services is emerging as a key growth and profit driver amid the digital revolution. Grandview Research expects the cloud market to grow by about 21% annually by 2030. Likewise, AMZN should be the biggest beneficiary as it controls 33% market share in the segment. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also invests in artificial intelligence solutions to enhance its cloud computing solutions. Consequently, AWS sales rose by 19% in the third quarter to $27.5 billion. The increase came as the company rolled out new services, improvements, and solutions for its cloud unit and e-commerce site. Parnassus Core Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ended the quarter slightly down, so our underweight position contributed to relative return. We added the stock after the share price declined significantly, and the timing of the purchase proved beneficial: after we initiated the position, shares rebounded strongly as sentiment around the consumer improved.” Overall AMZN ranks 4th on our list of Ken Fisher's top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar These Days. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. The debate around AI systems hitting a “data wall” or plateau is heating up in the tech industry with many arguing that the performance of AI models is not showing signs of further improvement amid a lack of quality inputs, causing scaling issues in the industry. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa recently discussed this debate in a program and said: “All it feels like anyone is talking about right now in tech is this debate over scaling laws and a data wall, which continues to rage in Silicon Valley. This is the idea that more data and bigger models will always lead to better AI, with some arguing that progress has peaked or is starting to plateau. Put another way, it’s a debate over a core assumption in AI that could have massive implications for the industry, from valuations to the GPUs powering it, and of course, the Nvidia story. I was at the Newcomer AI conference yesterday here in San Francisco. It was the theme of the day, with everyone from Scale AI’s Alexander Wang to Anthropic’s Dario Amodei to Databricks’ Ali Ghodsi weighing in.” Jensen Huang was also asked about the issue of AI systems hitting a data wall and possible scaling issues in a latest earnings call. Here is what he said: “A foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it’s continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we’re learning, however, is that it’s not enough that we’ve now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling.” Read Huang’s comments in detail here. Bosa mentioned some other tech leaders pushing back against the idea of AI hitting a data wall and said: “…..also acknowledge that this alone isn’t enough to push AI further, and progress will come from post-training scaling, which is the development of AI applications on top of existing models. He and others say this will still require massive amounts of compute power.

With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). manaemedia / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 279 Barclays recently highlighted what Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) could gain in the search market in certain scenarios of the outcome of the DoJ’s case against Google. “With Bing being a small part of the Microsoft top-line (5% of total revenue in FY24), the ramifications of any developments here seem to have been largely ignored based on our investor discussions, particularly with many software investors not having the context of the ongoing trial,” analyst Raimo Lenschow wrote in a note to clients. “However, following the Department of Justice’s long-awaited Proposed Final Judgment, we think that Microsoft investors should pay closer attention to any final rulings that come from the case.” Lenschow, who has an Overweight rating and a $475 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), noted that if the remedies include ending revenue-sharing agreements between Google and other parties, or if Google starts syndicating its search offering, Bing could gain market share. This might force Google to make some of its technology stack available to partners and offer search text ads for one year to U.S. partners while keeping just 10% of gross revenue. “In tandem with this, Google is only allowed to syndicate 25% of search text ads, meaning that partners (like an Apple) would need to backfill their remaining search ads either through their own tech stack or through a new partner like Bing,” Lenschow added. “This, in theory, would open up a unique opportunity for Microsoft to capture share for a period of time.” Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares detracted from performance after Microsoft reported weaker-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter revenue growth in its Azure cloud segment. Additionally, management’s fiscal first[1]quarter 2025 Azure revenue guidance came in slightly below estimates. Despite this shortfall, management highlighted that AI contributed 7% to cloud growth, up from 6% last quarter and 3% a year ago. We continue to believe that Microsoft is well-positioned to maintain a leadership role in AI, given its innovative approach and significant growth potential.” Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: An Intel Break-Up Could Follow Its CEO Shake-Up, Bank of America Says

Intel (INTC) could break up its operations after CEO Pat Gelsinger's sudden retirement was announced Monday, according to Bank of America analysts. The analysts wrote Monday that Intel's internal manufacturing business and the foundry business that makes chips for other companies are now more likely to be separated, as the outgoing CEO was a proponent of keeping them together. Such a shake-up would still face a number of hurdles, like the strings attached to the nearly $8 billion in federal CHIPS Act funding announced last week. The BofA analysts said that the funding agreement dictates that Intel needs to retain at least a 35% stake in its foundry business. "Both businesses are undergoing their own strategic, structural, financial, and competitive issues, with no near term solution in sight," the analysts wrote, maintaining their "underperform" rating and $21 price target on the shares. Intel's stock finished Monday slightly lower. While Intel shares have lost more than half their value since the start of the year, some of the company's few bright spots have come from reports of potential investments or acquisition offers, or after the chipmaker sold pieces of some assets. Bloomberg and Reuters reported Monday that Gelsinger met with the chipmaker's board last week over its concerns about the company's turnaround effort and its progress in catching up to competitors like Nvidia (NVDA)—and allegedly was given the choice to retire or be fired.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed at record highs on Monday as stocks kicked off the final month of a banner 2024 on a high note. The S&P 500 edged up 0.2% to extend its recent record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped almost 0.3% from its recent all-time closing high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite popped almost 1%, with Apple (AAPL) shares also touching a record. Other tech stocks gained including Tesla (TSLA) and Meta (META), both up more than 3%. The S&P 500 and Dow are entering December on a roll, having ended November with their best monthly gains in a year. The rally got a boost last month thanks to optimism around President-elect Donald Trump's victory. Year to date, the benchmark S&P is up over 25%, while the Dow has gained nearly 20%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has gained nearly 30%. In individual stocks, shares in Jeep maker Stellantis (STLA) sank after CEO Carlos Tavares suddenly resigned. Meanwhile, Intel (INTC) stock ended lower after the company said its CEO, Pat Gelsinger, had retired from the struggling chipmaker. Investors are starting to count down to the November jobs report on Friday, a key input for the Federal Reserve's policy making, as well as to job openings and private payrolls readings. A surprise monthly jobs print could reset the expectations for rate cuts that have supported stocks' stellar performance this year. That said, bets on a slower path of Fed easing haven't made a significant dent in the recent appetite for stocks. Meanwhile, the dollar (DX=F) climbed as investors assessed Trump's latest tariff threat. The incoming president warned BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) not to create a rival to the US currency, saying on Saturday that they will face 100% tariffs if they move away from it. Trump has already put markets on alert with promises to hit Canada, Mexico, and China with big new tariffs. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy The Nasdaq and S&P 500 closed at record highs on Monday as investors looked ahead towards a crucial jobs report later this week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% to notch a new all-time closing high while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped almost 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) popped nearly 1% with tech stocks leading the gains. The "Magnificent Seven" stocks gained, with Apple (AAPL) touching new highs. Tesla (TSLA) shares also gained on the heels of bullish calls. Nvidia (NVDA) shares closed just above the flat line. On Friday, investors will receive crucial labor market data, which could give the Federal Reserve more clues on whether it should hold rates steady or continue its cutting cycle. The Federal Open Market Committee will meet later this month. Fed governor Christopher Waller said on Monday he's leaning toward supporting another rate cut, but he may change his mind if inflation data surprises to the upside. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller said on Monday he leans toward supporting another rate cut when the Federal Open Market Committee meets this month, but he may change his mind if inflation data surprises to the upside. "Based on the economic data in hand today and forecasts that show that inflation will continue on its downward path to 2% over the medium term, at present I lean toward supporting a cut to the policy rate at our December meeting," Waller said during prepared remarks at a conference in D.C. on Monday. He went on to say, "But that decision will depend on whether data that we will receive before then surprises to the upside and alters my forecast for the path of inflation." “I will be watching the incoming data closely over the next couple weeks to help me make my decision as to what path to take,” added Waller. The FOMC is expected to meet on Dec 17 and 18. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: Donald Trump's latest tariff threat appears to have stemmed at least in part from a nascent blockchain-based entrant into the influential world of global financial messaging. The president-elect's move came in a Saturday afternoon post where he promised 100% tariffs on countries looking to move away from the dollar. "[A]ny Country that tries should wave goodbye to America," he wrote. The target was an organization called BRICS, which currently boasts 10 nations and is led by the Western adversaries of China and Russia. One new product offering appears to be a key stumbling block. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports; The end of the holiday weekend added two fresh examples of a historic shift on Wall Street: More CEOs than ever are heading for the exits. Over the past 24 hours, the leaders of chipmaker Intel (INTC) and auto giant Stellantis (STLA) have both announced their departures, bolstering the CEO turnover tally. The leadership changes highlight the idiosyncrasies and challenges of each company — from a struggling auto lineup to a too-late computer chip turnaround. But they also reflect a broader trend across corporate America. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: The Stellantis (STLA) 2024 roller coaster hit a new low with CEO Carlos Tavares’s abrupt resignation on Sunday. Stellantis’ senior independent director Henri de Castries said in a statement that “in recent weeks different views have emerged,” which have resulted in the board and Tavares parting ways. “Speculation is likely to be rife as to what has happened, but it was already known that Tavares would resign in 2026 at the end of his contract and a search for his successor was underway. That leaves the main question — why now?” HSBC analyst Mike Tyndall wrote in a short note Monday morning. Read more here. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock jumped to a session high by mid-day trading on Monday, gaining more than 30% after the server maker announced that the final findings from an independent review of its business found no evidence of fraud or misconduct. The company, which partners with Nvidia (NVDA) to provide high-tech servers with its AI chips, also said it will look for a new chief financial officer based on recommendations of the special committee conducting the review. Its current financial chief, David Weigand, will continue to serve in that position until his successor is appointed. The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary (XLY) sector hit an all-time high on Monday. XLY, which houses names like Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA), was up roughly 1% during the session. Year to date, the sector has gained more than 25%. US manufacturing activity may be slowly climbing out of its slump. On Monday, the ISM Manufacturing PMI showed a reading of 48.4 in November, an increase from the 46.5 seen last month and above economists' expectations for a reading of 47.5. This marked the highest reading for the index since June 2024, though notably the reading coming in under 50 indicates overall contraction in the sector. The sector has been above the 50 mark just once since October 2022, but Monday's reading could be an early sign that "better days lie ahead," according to Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons. "Looking ahead, we see significantly more positive signs for the U.S. manufacturing outlook than negative ones," Simons wrote in a note to clients on Monday. "Rate cuts will slow into next year, but more are coming. The Trump administration is focused on doing things that (it thinks) will improve U.S. competitiveness in manufacturing, including deregulation, a more accommodative tax environment, and protectionist tariffs. The jury is still out on the net benefit of the tariffs, but the other positive forces are unambiguous." Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: BlackRock (BLK) is close to making a $12 billion bet that would take it deeper into the hottest trade on Wall Street: private credit. The world’s largest money manager is discussing a deal to buy HPS Investment Partners, a firm run by three ex-employees of Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) that specializes in lending money to riskier companies. The transaction of $12 billion or more could be announced as soon as this week, according to reports in the Financial Times and Bloomberg. The deal could also still fall apart. Rad more there. Yahoo Finance's Yasmin Khorram reports: Tesla (TSLA) investors have good reason to watch the bromance between billionaire CEO Elon Musk and President-elect Donald Trump very closely. If the close relationship continues, it could eventually prove quite lucrative for the electric vehicle maker. Trump's transition team is looking for policymakers for the Department of Transportation and one of its agencies, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), to spearhead self-driving regulation, likely easing the rules to enable faster development, according to a report by Bloomberg. However, experts interviewed by Yahoo Finance say changing the rules of the road may be a lot more complicated. Currently, self-driving is regulated on a state-by-state basis, and Tesla likely does not have the technology nailed down for total autonomous driving. Read more here. Tech stocks helped lift the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) to record intraday highs on Monday morning. Shares of Apple (AAPL) rose 1% to touch a new record. All of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks gained in early trading, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares jumped as much as 12% in early trading after the server maker said an independent review of its business by a special committee found no evidence of fraud or misconduct. "The evidence reviewed by the Special Committee does not give rise to any substantial concerns about the integrity of the Company’s senior management or Audit Committee, or their commitment to ensuring that the Company’s financial statements are materially accurate," the company said in a filing to the SEC. Super Micro also said it is searching for a new CFO. Its current financial chief, David Weigand, will continue to serve in that position until his successor is appointed. Shares of the server maker have been on a roller coaster ride after an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research claimed accounting malpractice. Last month, Super Micro hired a new auditor, BDO, after its accountant, EY, resigned in late October. Tesla stock (TSLA) rose more than 3% in early trading amid bullish analyst commentary. The gains in the stock helped lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC). Roth MKM upgraded shares of the electric vehicle giant to Buy from Hold, while Stifel raised its price target on the stock from $287 to $411 per share. Tesla's shares have surged amid optimism surrounding CEO Elon Musk's close relationship with President-elect Donald Trump. The stock is up more than 40% since the presidential election on Nov. 5. US stocks were little changed on Monday, holding near record highs, as investors awaited an important monthly jobs report at the end of the week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was relatively flat, coming off a record close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed on the heels of the index's own all-time high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up 0.2%. Consumer Discretionary (XLY) stocks gained in early trading, while Utilities (XLU) and Industrials (XLI) slipped. On Monday, Intel (INTC) shares gained after the struggling semiconductor maker said CEO Pat Gelsinger had stepped down as of Dec. 1. Intel (INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired and stepped down from the board of directors, effective Dec. 1, according to the company. Intel shares were up more than 4% in premarket trading following the announcement. In a statement, Intel said it has named David Zinsner and Michelle (MJ) Johnston Holthaus as interim co-CEOs while the board of directors conducts a search for a new CEO. The semiconductor giant has struggled to keep up with peers or implement an effective turnaround plan amid a series of quarters of declining revenue. The stock is down over 50% year to-date. In November, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and replaced by rival Nvidia (NVDA). Economic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI (November final); Construction spending (October); ISM Manufacturing & prices paid (November) Earnings: Zscaler (ZS) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed over the weekend and early this morning: Jobs report to test stock rally's staying power: The week ahead Stellantis stock sinks as CEO's early exit leaves void Bezos backs AI chipmaker vying with Nvidia at $2.6B value Trump's pick to run FCC is an ominous sign for Big Tech New Biden strike on China's chips to hit toolmakers President Biden pardons his son Hunter despite promise Dollar faces treacherous December as Trump, rate risks boil over Trump’s Plans Risk Inflating Bullish Stock Market Into a Bubble It may be the holiday season on Wall Street, but that doesn't mean analysts aren't out and about making calls into year-end. Here are three notes that caught my attention before 6 a.m. ET. After a recent management meeting, JPMorgan's longtime retail analyst Matt Boss is upgrading his rating on Gap (GAP) to Overweight (Buy equivalent). His price target went to $30 from $28. "With the foundation set under CEO Richard Dickson to support a consistent playbook of improved merchandising & marketing across all four brands, we see Gap at an inflection point to support low-to-mid-single-digit sales growth, annual operating margin expansion targeting historical levels of profitability," Boss said. A recent chat I had with Dickson helps to shed light on Boss's call. There is more going on here besides me shopping more at Banana Republic Factory, and additional insight on the analyst vibe on Gap can be found via Yahoo Finance's analyst recommendation tool. Ahead of Lululemon's (LULU) earnings on Dec. 5, Citi analyst Paul Lejuez is sticking with a Neutral rating (Hold equivalent) on the stock. But it's this call out on the stock from Lejuez that caught my eye: "Short interest currently sits at 6% of the float, above the 4% level three months ago and the highest short interest level in two years. Based on our conversations with investors, sentiment on Lulemon remains negative on the trajectory of Lululemon's US business, although most expect a sales/EPS beat in 3Q (driven by stronger international sales) and do not see another 2024 EPS guide down this quarter. Most bearish investors believe it will be difficult for Lululemon to grow EPS in 2025." Here is more on Lululemon's short interest and other stats from the Yahoo Finance platform. Veteran tech analyst Mark Mahaney at Evercore ISI is hiking his price target on Netflix (NFLX) to $950 from $775 per share. Netflix stock currently trades at $886. Mahaney called Netflix shares a "small buy" and reiterated an Outperform rating. "At a high level, what our survey results and recent events (e.g., Q3 EPS and the massive success of the Tyson-Paul fight) suggest is that Netflix is in the strongest position financially, fundamentally and competitively that we have ever seen," Mahaney wrote. "Its overall streaming leadership — in terms of both market share and content quality — is commanding. And the clearly positive churn intent and price sensitivity results across all three of this quarter’s surveys are material positives for a subscription business. We also see four notable near-term catalysts — Christmas Day NFL games, the 12/26 release of Squid Games II, WWE Raw in January, and pending price increases," he added.

Title: AI Is All Picks And Shovels, No Gold

When it comes to AI you may be better off betting on the the suppliers—the “pick and shovel” ... [+] providers. Nvidia has become a household word these days. As a holder since 2015, I have experienced the growth stages of the stock—along with the sell offs—for almost ten years. Some of those stages were short lived—like the crypto mining rush and the gaming rush. Today’s almost universal worshipping of the company has a very different tone though. There are few investors taking the other side of this trade. Here are some of my concerns: This last point troubles me the most. Why are investors so enchanted by AI? AI has seduced investors, companies and curious onlookers with its potential to reshape industries. From IBM’s Watson to ChatGPT’s ability to mimic human conversation, we’ve come a long way in “narrow AI” advancements. These narrow successes pave the way for dreams of “general AI”—a system that truly mimics human intelligence. But the road from wishful innovation to transformative reality has yet to be constructed. We should expect AI advances to show up in repetitive tasks, call centers and other low-level functions. But we should be careful thinking that AI will advance beyond that. Why is that? Despite its early wins, AI still trails behind in the simplest of human tasks. It can play chess, write college admissions essays and solve complicated equations but ask it to play charades or navigate a tumbleweed on the highway and you’ll be very disappointed. Computers excel in training and processing unimaginable amounts of data. But intelligence that rivals the human brain—running on 0.3 kWh and the size of two fists—is still a distant dream. Investors have largely ignored this observation. While “breakthroughs” dominate headlines, the underlying theoretical progress remains slow. Theorists are leading the way, questioning fundamental approaches, while experimentalists—the coders—tinker with existing frameworks. But you can’t invest in theorists. Investors have worked around this by identifying other ways to invest. Last year, two paths emerged: bet on the builders (companies creating AI products) or the suppliers (the “pick and shovel” providers). Mark Twain famously quipped, “When everyone is looking for gold, it’s a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.” Nvidia, as a supplier of GPUs, has become a cornerstone of AI infrastructure. So far with Big Tech spending at an all-time high—fueled by a fear of being left behind—the pick-and-shovel approach has been paying dividends. But I don’t think this trend can continue indefinitely. At its core, AI today is more artificial than intelligent. While the technology marches forward, human common sense—embedded in our brains, shaped by bodies and honed through experience—remains far out of reach. The AI gold rush may continue for now, but savvy investors will look beyond the glitter to the tools fueling the frenzy. Here are two early warning signals I have used as AI sell triggers: DeepSouth and other inventions might be that better mousetrap. Yet hardly anyone is considering this possibility. If DeepSouth’s pending demonstration is successful it could shift all business away from Nvidia in a short time. It could transform the entire industry and produce many casualties. Regarding the Great Enlightenment, a few analysts are beginning to ask about the buildout and timing of possible dividends. So I think the dawn of the Great Enlightenment—that forces a reevaluation of today’s runaway spending—has begun. AI-related stocks are riding high, but a large selloff could be on the horizon as the Great Enlightenment and Better Mousetrap gain momentum. While riding the AI wave has been exciting and profitable, it may be time to consider stepping off the surfboard. Disclosure: Andersen Capital owns the referenced stocks in this article.

Title: Here’s How Wall Street Expects S&P 500 To Perform In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/12/02/heres-how-wall-street-expects-sp-500-to-perform-in-2025/

Most major banks call for a third consecutive year of strong returns for the S&P 500, the benchmark stock index tracking 500 of the largest public American companies, offering a welcome bullish signal for investors already enjoying a historic bull market. Can the stock market replicate the 20%-plus gains hit each of the next two years? Bank of America: BofA predicts the mark of the bullish beast, setting a 6,666 target for the S&P by the end of next year. That’s a 10% projected rise from Monday’s 6,050 price for the index. Among the tailwinds cited by the strategists led by Savita Subramanian include macroeconomic factors like lower interest rates and higher labor market productivity as well as a more favorable corporate backdrop with accelerating earnings and a potentially lower tax rate under President-elect Donald Trump. And “the average stock is more attractive than the overall index,” Subramanian said in a Monday call with reporters, explaining the “average stock is actually pretty inexpensive” with the last two years’ rally driving almost entirely by a handful of mega-cap technology stocks. BMO Capital Markets: The Canada-based firm has a 6,700 price target for the S&P, predicting an 11% gain. “Earnings growth is actually understated” and “the train has left the station” with the prospect of further gains as the Federal Reserve further lowers interest rates, BMO’s chief investment strategist Brian Belski told CNBC on Monday. “ Deutsche Bank: The German-based bank has a Wall Street high end-of-2025 price target of 7,000 for the S&P. The Binky Chadha-led strategist group calls for about 16% further gains for American equities. “Various aspects” of the economic cycle should support a further advance, including increased capital expenditures outside of big technology, a boost from overseas economic recovery and a likely bump in mergers and acquisitions activity, according to Chadha. Evercore ISI: The tech-focused boutique bank set a 6,600 target for the S&P by the middle of 2025 following the election. The bull market is “still an infant,” wrote strategists led by Julian Emanuel. Yet the recent stalling of the post-election stock rally – the S&P is up less than 1% over the last four weeks– indicates the market is in a “digestion phase,” Emanuel told Bloomberg recently. Goldman Sachs: The investment bank predicted in a note to clients the S&P will end next year at 6,500, a 9% gain from Monday. It’s a view “predicated on continued U.S. economic expansion” and bolstered by the forecasted 11% earnings per share growth for the 500-company index. Notably, the Goldman group led by David Kostin predicts 2025 will be the slimmest relative outperformance of the “magnificent seven” stocks of the U.S.’ seven largest companies since 2017, reversing a trend of extended market-beating returns from the group led by AI leader Nvidia and iPhone maker Apple. Morgan Stanley: The Goldman rival has a matching 6,500 12-month price target for the S&P, the group led by Michael Wilson shared in a note. Morgan Stanley has a balmier 13% EPS growth forecast than Goldman, but shared the potential for “wider than normal” risks to its forecast due to “the potential uncertainty that the recent election outcome introduces.” Wilson set a bull case target of 7,400 for the S&P, implying a potential 26% advance, and a 4,600 bear case target, indicating a possible 28% correction. UBS: UBS Global Wealth Management has a 6,600 target for the S&P by the end of 2025, indicating a slightly more bullish 10% gain. The election “likely pulled forward the timing” of the returns associated with optimism from President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January, wrote Jason Draho, the group’s head of asset allocation, Americas, wrote to clients last week. Yardeni Research: The influential independent research firm led by has a balmy 7,000 target by the end of next year, implying a 19% gain. “Trump 2.0 represents a major regime change that’s bullish for the economy and stocks,” Yardeni wrote last week. This is the “highest concentration market in 100 years,” Kostin said in a conference call with reporters. “But you look out longer term…the history of a high concentration market is it doesn't persist. It eventually fades. You get a broadening of the market.” No surprise considering the often unpredictable nature of financial markets, price targets even from the most trusted names on Wall Street can prove imperfect. Last November, Goldman and Morgan Stanley projected the S&P to end 2024 at 4,700 and 4,500, respectively, both more than 25% below Monday’s price. 10,000. That’s where the bullish Yardeni predicts the S&P could climb to 10,000 by the end of 2029, forecasting a strong 16% annualized return. Up 27% year-to-date, the S&P is on track to top 2023’s 23% gain, excluding dividends. This would be the first time the index rose at least 20% in consecutive years since 1995 to 1998 during the internet boom. The S&P’s 58% gain dating back to the end of 2022 has it on pace for its best two-year gain since the late 1990s. Driving much of the S&P’s recent success, which came in the face of a historically challenging high-rate environment, were big technology stocks, with the likes of Amazon, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all gaining more than 150% since the end of 2022.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. After an independent review revealing no board or audit committee misbehavior, Super Micro Computer (SMCI, Financials) shares soared about 30% on Monday. The Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) partner will replace its CFO in line with improvements in governance. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Initiated after auditor Ernst & Young resignation for governance and internal control issues, the special committee's review found no need for financial restatements. Since then, Super Micro has hired BDO USA as its new auditor and sent Nasdaq a compliance report meant to stop delisting. Over three months, the assessment turned significant procedural flaws but no proof supporting Ernst & Young's claims. Former vice president of finance Kenneth Cheung has been appointed chief accounting officer per committee recommendations. To improve governance, the business intends to name a new general counsel, chief compliance officer, and chief financial officer. Super Micro does not plan to restate financial reporting for fiscal year 2024 or other years; it intends to achieve Nasdaq's listing criteria within the discretionary time. Super Micro has been especially close to Nvidia, incorporating its GPUs into its server systems to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning uses. This cooperation has improved Super Micro's standing in the market for artificial intelligence servers. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more Update: Cyber Monday may be over now, but many stores will slide into 'Cyber Week' to ride out the holiday deals event a little longer. We've been highlighting deals below since before Black Friday last week. Many will be expiring as we speak, but it's worth a quick look as some could continue on for a few more days. Original article follows: The S90D is our favorite 2024 TV overall. Its QD-OLED panel delivers a high-contrast image with vivid colors, wide viewing angles, and impressive brightness for this class. The U6N is one of the top budget TVs available. The 4K QLED display uses quantum dots, local dimming, and a Mini LED backlight to deliver higher contrast and a wider range of colors than most competitors in its class. The C4 is LG's latest midrange 4K OLED TV. It carries over everything we loved about last year's C3 while offering a slight increase in brightness and support for a faster 144Hz refresh rate with a PC. Samsung's Frame TV can be mounted flush against your wall like a hanging piece of art. It also features a matte screen to make it look more like canvas, and you can purchase optional magnetic frame bezels in different colors and designs. This 100-inch TV is a whopping size that will allow you to catch every inch of every game. With up to 800 nits of HDR brightness, local dimming, and a fast 144Hz refresh rate, this is one of the best values there is at this size. TCL's S5 LED display doesn't use quantum dots like the brand's pricier QLED TVs, but it's still capable of wide color support and it uses the Amazon Fire TV OS for easy integration with Alexa. The TCL QM7 is an impressive midrange QLED TV. Its Mini LED contrast performance, high brightness, and 144Hz gaming capabilities are nearly unrivaled at this price range. The B4 is LG's entry-level OLED TV. Though it can't get as bright as pricier models, it still offers an infinite contrast which makes it a great budget OLED for watching movies in a dark room. TCL's S5 is one of the brand's entry-level 4K TVs. Brightness and contrast are limited compared to pricier models, but the S5 still offers a wide range of colors and has Alexa built-in. This 720p TV comes with Alexa Voice Remote capabilities, so you can easily search across apps, switch inputs, and much more using your voice — no clunky remotes and tedious typing necessary. We only recommend it if you can find it on sale, though. Paramount Plus offers a huge library of on-demand content from Paramount, CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. The Premium Plan also includes Showtime and live CBS streaming. It costs $12.99 a month or $120 a year. For the next two months, though, you get this tier for just $2.99 a month, which is a great opportunity to make your way through a few shows with no irritating ads - of which there are many on the ad-supported tier. Paramount Plus is perfect for viewers who want to stream CBS TV shows, local NFL games, and tons of content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. And if you get the premium tier you can also unlock ad-free streaming and access to Showtime. A new promotion sees the monthly fee knocked down to $2.99 for a couple of months. There's a huge double-saving on these two bundled popular ad-supported streaming platforms as this price lasts for 12 months. If you subscribe to these two individually, they're $9.99 a month each. Outside of Cyber Monday, this already-discounted Duo package would be $10.99, but less than a cup of coffee a month for the next year is unbeatable value. Offer expires December 2. Hulu is an excellent choice for cord-cutters thanks to a mix of exclusive titles and next-day streaming for popular network shows. The ad-supported tier is usually $9.99 a month, but the epic Cyber Monday deal has returned, lowering those monthly fee prices to just 99 cents for a year. We'd spend an extra couple of bucks and get it bundled with Disney Plus, though. Both offers expire December 2. Peacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming. The annual version of Peacock's ad-supported tier is an absolute steal right now, with a major Cyber Monday discount getting you a whole year of access for just $19.99. That's plenty of time to enjoy a rich collection of sitcoms, movies, and live events. Offer expires December 2. The Starz streaming service offers several original shows and classic movies. The semi-annual plan is a steal compared to a standard month-to-month subscription. Fubo is the streaming service for sports fans. Its huge library of channels includes regional and international sports leagues, setting it apart from the competition. You can also tack on additional programming to your plan, but it'll cost you extra. The Leesa Sapira Hybrid Mattress provides great edge support and motion isolation. Its mix of memory foam and pocket springs produces an average firmness, making it an outstanding solution for back pain sufferers of any sleeping style. Save an extra $25 with our exclusive promo code INSIDER25. The Saatva Classic Mattress is designed to suit a variety of sleeping styles and features a plush top for luxurious comfort. The DreamCloud Premier Hybrid Mattress performed well in all of our tests, which makes it ideal for most sleeping types, couples, and people who tend to overheat at night. Casper has redesigned its classic hybrid mattress into the Dream, which offers a medium-firm feel that sleeps cool and has zone support. While we haven't tested it yet, the Nectar Premier is designed to be a step up in comfort from the Classic, which we love. At under $1,000, it's the brand's most popular model. The gel memory foam of the Nectar makes it a versatile mattress that conforms to the contours of your body to relieve pressure. It's a premium sleep experience, but its price tag is way under a grand. The memory foam of the Bear mattress, combined with Celliant technology, makes this a great bed for active folks looking for some rest and recovery. Apply code BFCM4TY to save 40% off at checkout, and get free pillows, instead of the automatically applied deal. The Big Fig Mattress is constructed for heavier individuals with firm support and a high weight capacity. The Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress features contouring foam that cradles sleepers of all body types and sleeping styles while offering outstanding pressure relief and heat dissipation. The Scuba is a crowd-favorite style from lululemon, and this version has a roomy, oversized fit alongside the style's signature fleecy fabric. This simple knit is made with a blend of recycled and virgin cashmere. It comes in five colorways. "Jenni Kayne's cashmere sweaters are a splurge for sure, but this one is the best luxury-grade cardigan I've tried," writes associate style editor Gabrielle Chase. “Upon feeling the soft material, I knew that the piece was quality and would hold up after more than just a few wears and washes,” says freelance reporter Olivia Rose Rushing. “I was surprised at just how comfy it was — especially since I was able to adjust the shoulder straps to my liking.” This pushup bra uses a super-soft sheen microfiber fabric with extra-compressive side wings for a smoothing effect. It’s designed to be invisible under clothing. Featuring a sumptuous sherpa collar, an asymmetrical closure, and a soft leather construction, this trend-forward jacket will keep you warm all season long, sans sacrificing style. With 700-fill power, responsibly-sourced goose down, a water-repellent and wind-resistant fabric, and a removable hood, this cropped puffer will keep you warm all through winter. It comes in 11 colors. “I’ve been buying Abercrombie & Fitch winter coats for years, and I’ve never been disappointed in a purchase," says freelance writer Talia Ergas. "The Ultra Puffer turned out to be everything I hoped for. The puffiness is balanced nicely by the short silhouette and luxurious faux fur accents. I also love that the bottom hem is elastic, so it hugs my hips and keeps the cold out.” This soft, smooth raschel fleece jacket is lightweight and insulating. Plus, it's made from 100% recycled materials. There’s no time like the present to layer up in a seriously cozy flannel shirt jacket. Complete with a quilted lining, it’s a perfectly rugged layer atop a thermal shirt on brisk winter mornings. Turn back the clock with this throwback rugby shirt, a Ralph Lauren staple for decades that looks as great now as it did back in the day. This cozy knit is a versatile layering piece thanks to its breathable cotton construction. While it’s a men’s sweater, many of our female editors found the sizing to be perfectly oversized for all shapes, sizes, and genders. This jacket feels like a plush fleece but is still thin enough for winter layering. It comes in several different color options, from navy to green or brown. This effortlessly cool mini skirt stands out for its functional cargo pockets and stretchy cotton moleskin fabric—and it looks equally great paired with a graphic tee or sweater as it does with a blouse and tights. These size-inclusive jeans are available in petite and tall lengths and have an extra two inches in the hips to create an easy-going, flattering fit.

They also come with Bonobos’ eye-catching lined pockets for a colorful touch of flair. Wear these medium-compression shorts under your ensemble for a smoothing effect. Designed with an ultra-thin, breathable fabric that is moisture-wicking and quick-drying and a no-squeeze silicone waistband that prevents rolling, this shapewear is as comfy as it is flattering. These best-selling booties have a chic baby heel and an elongated toe, with a padded interior for an easier break-in period. These sophisticated leather boots are well-suited for nearly any occasion, be it a trip to the office or a night out with friends. The 2.5-inch stacked heel adds a nice boost in height—that is, without needing to sacrifice on comfort. L.L.Bean's shearling-lined 10-inch boots are the warmest of the bunch, but any of the Bean Boots will serve you well through both fall and winter, and they go with most outfits. The boot that made L.L.Bean a household name. These boots are designed to keep feet dry, warm, and comfortable in rain, mud, and other wet conditions. As the second iteration of the Tree Dasher running sneaker, this version is even more comfortable and equipped for performance. Allbirds Women's Tree Runner sneakers are crazy comfortable with a flattering and close-fitting silhouette and have a smooth but texturized upper. It’s hard to think of a more legendary sneaker than Air Jordans. The Mid version, originally released in 2001, offers the classic look, cushioning, and stability of the OG High Top while being less restrictive and even more affordable (all colorways are on sale). They may be small, but these chunky double hoops add big style to any outfit. Choose from four color and metal combinations: double gold, double silver, gold/marble blue, gold/silver. With seven princess-cut diamonds set on a white gold band, this ring is perfect for a wedding band or special occasion. The coziest version of the cult-favorite belt bag, this fleecy material adds a comfy, lived-in feel to any winter outfit.

It's equally at home at a formal event or a day on the town, and you can carry it as a top-handle bag, over-the-shoulder, or cross-body. This sleek leather wallet is ideal for those with dexterity issues as it can be opened with one hand, and it snaps shut with a satisfying magnetic seal. The 2022 MacBook Air introduced Apple's M2 processor, which improved performance over the M1 version. It has an especially thin and lightweight design, an improved webcam, and a larger display. Make sure to check for the 16GB RAM model, as it's becoming the standard base option instead of the original 8GB RAM model. The Series 10 is thinner than its predecessors, with a larger case and screen overall. It runs on the S10 processor; it has a wide-angle OLED display for easier reading at an angle, faster charging, and media playback from its speakers. The second-generation Apple Watch SE is an impressive entry-level wearable that shares the same processor as the Series 8 and Ultra, so it's still smooth despite being two years old. It doesn’t have the advanced health sensors of premium models, but it offers enough features to satisfy most people. Verizon is offering the iPhone 16 for free as long as the line using the phone is on the Unlimited Ultimate plan and the user doesn't switch phones for 36 months. The iPhone 16 Pro Max's year-over-year upgrades include a larger, 6.9-inch display, upgraded cameras, the powerful A18 Pro processor, and industry-leading battery life. New and existing Verizon customers can trade-in any phone in any condition from Apple, Google, or Samsung to get the iPhone 16 Pro free. You must keep the iPhone 16 Pro for 36 months (three years) to keep the deal active, and can't upgrade to a new phone. The line that's using this deal must have or upgrade to Verizon's Unlimited Ultimate plan. You also need service plans for the free iPad and Apple Watch. There may be a one-time $35 activation fee. It's possible to get an iPhone 16 Pro Max with this deal, but it would cost $5/month for 36 months. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is Samsung's top-end phone in 2024, set apart from its Galaxy S24 siblings and most of the premium phone competition with its four cameras, giant 6.8-inch display, stunning battery life, and included S Pen stylus. The Pixel 9 Pro XL offers a large 6.8-inch display and one of the best battery test results we've seen in a phone. The Pixel 9 Pro shares the same performance, first-rate three-lens camera system, super-bright Actua display, and Gemini AI suite with a free year of Gemini Advanced. Mint's Unlimited plan offers unlimited talk, text, and data, but you'll be slowed to 4G LTE speeds after using 40GB. New customers can get half off their first three months when they pay up front. We recommend signing up for the Unlimited option to score the most savings since it's typically the priciest of the lineup. When you buy an eligible phone through Mint Mobile, you can bundle it with a year of an unlimited data plan at a 50% discounted rate of just $15/month. The MVNO is also heavily discounting several phones from their standard starting prices, including up to $500 off the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Dell's line of premium XPS laptops are known for their performance and reliability. The 9530 series features Intel's Core i7-13620H processor and starts with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. That should be plenty of performance and storage for most people with busy, fast-paced workloads. This Dell Inspiron's display folds 180-degrees to turn the laptop into a tablet. Running on the AMD Ryzen 5 8640HS processor, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage, it can handle most people's workloads with ease. The base model IdeaPad 1 comes with a large 15-inch screen and runs on the entry-level AMD Ryzen 3 7320U processor with 4GB RAM and 128GB of storage. It's purely for very basic uses, like lightweight web browsing, but it's priced well for its purpose. Creative Cloud allows you to enjoy all the best apps Adobe has to offer, including Photoshop, Animate, and Illustrator. Amazon's latest Kindle Paperwhite offers even faster performance than its predecessors in the same thin, waterproof form readers love.

Away's new luggage line is the brand's first foray into soft-sided luggage. In our tests, soft-side bags surprisingly tend to be more durable than hard-sided bags and offer a bit more flexibility in packing space. One of our editor's recently tested this human-sized dog bed, calling it a "dream come true" and "like laying in a supportive cloud." The Coop Sleep Goods Original Pillow offers thoughtful features like adjustable fill, a washable pillow cover, and an unparalleled 100-night trial, making it the best choice for most people.

The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The PS5 Slim Digital Edition doesn't include a disc drive, but you can buy one later on for $80 if you decide you want to play game discs later on. This package features some Fortnite-related freebies, including in-game outfits and weapons. The PS5 is one of the best gaming consoles you can buy thanks to its powerful hardware, unique controller, and exclusive games.

The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X shares many features with the more expensive Nova Pro, like a noise-canceling microphone and wireless cross-platform support, while maintaining a midrange price. This Corsair drive is a great all-around PS5 SSD with a selection of sizes from 1GB up to 8TB. The built-in heatsink saves you a few dollars over buying one yourself and makes for a slightly easier installation process. 1TB/2TB is plenty for most gamers and is where the best value lies as the price jump on larger capcities is wildly disproportionate on a dollar per GB ratio. The J9+ is a powerful robot vacuum that deftly navigates around household obstacles, leaves hardwood floors spotless, and tackles low-pile carpets with ease. Although we haven't tried this exact model, we've tested a similar Shark 2-1 robot vacuum with Matrix technology and had great results. It has both standard suction and mopping abilities, hence the 2-1 in the name. We tested the Shark PowerDetect in a different color and found it was the best robot vacuum for pet hear, thanks to its roomy, self-empty charging dock and powerful suction when it detects heavy debris. The Ecovacs DEEBOT X2 OMNI Robot Vacuum & Mop is a wet-dry vacuum robot that maps your house quickly and has a station with a hands-off self-cleaning system. The V15 Detect Absolute Cordless Stick Vacuum is one of Dyson's most powerful models. It features HEPA filtration and laser illumination to reveal hidden debris. This model usually runs north of $700, but it's 40% off right now. We've never seen it priced this low. The Dyson V11 Extra cordless vacuum cleaner is engineered with the power, versatility and run time for a whole-home deep clean. This cordless vacuum can help suck up pesky pet hair from anywhere in the house. At 4.5 quarts, this stand mixer is a bit smaller than we usually recommend for folks who want a full-size mixer, but this is a stellar deal if you don't mind the more petite capacity. The OXO Brew Conical Burr Grinder grinds slowly, but that in turn reduces static, noise, and inconsistencies in your grounds. Make cooking easier with the Ninja Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) and its five different cooking settings. From baking to dehydrating, this air fryer can be the new secret touch behind your recipes. This massive 14-qt. air fryer is just $50, and is equipped to handle large family-sized meals with two racks to cook double the food. It also uniquely has a built-in rotating rotisserie rack to make your own chicken roast. Coffee is a serious necessity for some, and the AeroPress is small, simple, portable, and easy-to-use way to brew a highly competitive, frothy cup of coffee somewhere between a French press and an espresso. This self-cleaning, programmable coffee maker allows you to choose your brew strength, so you always get the perfect cup of coffee. This white nonstick cookware set can help enhance any kitchen. It includes frying pans, a stock pot, saucepans with lids, and more. The classic 3D Whitestrips take only 20 days of use to complete a full treatment and also come with two sets of "1 Hour Express" strips for more last-minute whitening sessions. It may be pricey, but if you're looking for a high-tech hair dryer that actually lives up to the hype, the Dyson Super Sonic may be for you. The Dyson Airwrap is a little too much blow-dryer-brush for most people, but there are few systems that give you such versatility. This multi-styler comes with six different options for brush heads, complete with a styling comb, filter cleaning brush, travel bag, and storage case. Rihanna created this fragrance specifically for her own body and decided to share it with the world.

It’s an incredible value and includes three gorgeous color stories ideal for holiday parties and beyond. The most recently confirmed shade of Taylor Swift's iconic red lipstick, this warm brown-ish red was worn by Taylor to a 2024 Chiefs game. This cult-favorite concealer offers lightweight coverage that sinks seamlessly into the skin. This one-of-a-kind moisturizer is part skincare, part makeup. It's packed with nourishing oils like grapeseed. But instead of absorbing into your skin, the moisturizing ingredients sit on the surface and create a dewy glow that's also hydrating your skin. The Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence uses snail mucin to repair and fortify your complexion. Apple's latest generation of AirPods features a new design to optimize comfort for wearers of every kind. It's powered by the H2 chip and uses a smaller case than ever. Apple's base AirPods are now available with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) without the use of in-ear tips. The new model uses the brand's H2 chip to power features like Transparency Mode, Adaptive Audio, and Conversation Awareness. Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds deliver excellent sound quality and noise canceling in a sleek, comfy design that’s tough to beat. Apple's update to the AirPods Max finally moves the headphones to USB-C charging and five new colors. Otherwise, the hardware and audio performance are largely the same. The Sonos Ace are the comfiest headphones we've reviewed. They also offer great noise-canceling and audio quality that rival top models from the competition. Anker’s Soundcore Life Q30 headphones offer noise-canceling performance that’s much better than it should be for the money, alongside solid sound quality and massive battery life. Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra once more put the brand on top, with best-in-class noise canceling wrapped in a sleek and comfy design. The Beats Studio Pro x Kim Kardashian are the same as the standard Studio Pro wireless headphones, but with a color curated by Kim Kardashian. They are designed to do it all, whether you want to be fully immersed in an album or take a call on the go. They offer both active noise canceling (ANC) and transparency modes, making them a versatile option for any situation. We've spotlighted The Ultra Puffer in our round up of the best Abercrombie Cyber Monday deals because it's a lookalike to Aritzia's SuperPuff and only costs $120 (plus, you can get it for an extra 15% off with the code CYBERAF). "It's a bit puffy, but that's balanced nicely by the short silhouette and faux fur accents," writes freelance author Talia Ergas. "The hood is detachable, which gives me two looks in one. I also love that the bottom hem is elastic, so it hugs my hips and keeps the cold out." Find more outerwear at a discount in our guide to the best Cyber Monday deals on women's winter coats. Two years ago, when I was busy hunting down an Xbox Series X, I wished someone from the future told me I wouldn't need one to play Xbox games. Much of my gaming isn't even through the pricey console but my Game Pass subscription. If I had resisted FOMO and waited, I could have saved hundreds by getting the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max instead, bundled with a wireless controller and one month of Game Pass Ultimate. Game Pass is the Xbox's cloud-based game streaming service, and the Ultimate package lets you access all available games on any supported device, including the latest Amazon Fire TV Stick. You're ready to play once you have the Xbox app downloaded and the controller connected. The Fire TV Stick is also a good option for when you're traveling and away from your Xbox console. With Game Pass, you can pick up a game where you left off. No, you won't get the full experience as you would on a Series X or Series S machine. But as long as you have a good connection, the visuals look great, and the gameplay feels similar to playing on the console. Les Shu I can't shower in silence. I need music, a podcast, or something to listen to. Enter the JBL Go 3 Bluetooth Speaker, currently just $30 for Cyber Monday. I like that it's waterproof, durable, gets plenty loud, and has decent sound quality, even when I crank it as I sing along to Kate Bush. Full disclosure: I've purchased two of these speakers. The first one lasted over two years before it stopped charging (it recharged using a USB-C connection). You see, I kept the speaker in the shower with me. So, every day, it would get completely drenched. That kind of treatment will cause any electronics to malfunction. So, I bought a replacement and kept it outside the shower, within reach, and it's worked like a charm. I have little patience for malfunctioning electronics and haven't had any troubles with the JBL Go 3. I especially like how easily it pairs with my phone via Bluetooth and stays connected for quite a distance when I wander off. At $30, this matches the lowest price ever for the JBL Go 3. I strongly recommend it for you or as an affordable gift for the shower singer in your life. Abercrombie has come a long way as a brand, especially when it comes to sizing. Gone are the days of disappointment from a roster of impossibly tiny sizes — we've since welcomed an era of unexpected but much-appreciated inclusivity. Our style team has been testing jeans for years, and Abercrombie's denim is some of the best for the price. You can read our review of Abercrombie jeans or check out the current Cyber Monday sale, which includes an automatic 25% off nearly every pair and an extra 15% off once you add them to your cart. Most of the brand's jeans come in sizes 23 up to 37, and many also come in several length options, including extra short, short, regular, long, and extra long. I'm just over 5 feet tall and I mostly wear the extra short or short sizes. I love that they don't just offer a single petite or tall length and call it a day — you can really get the size that's best for you. This discount is the best any of us have seen this year so far and we doubt it will happen again for a while, so you might want to get a move on tonight! Sally Kaplan If you have oily lids like me, you know how tough it is to keep your eyeshadow looking good throughout the day. With my almond-shaped eyes, I also experience a lot of trouble keeping eyeliner crisp in my outer corners, as most formulas rub away after a few hours. That's why I love Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion — and right now, it's only $14, so I had to stock back up. The formula itself is sheer, but a little goes a long way. A thin coat keeps my eye makeup lasting all day, even in finicky places like my creases or outer corners. I've been a fan for years, and every year, I wait for this product to go on sale during Black Friday or Cyber Monday to restock. This year, I lucked out, and it was only half-price, making it super easy to add to the cart. We cover a lot of makeup here at Insider Reviews. Check out our beauty coverage to learn more about the best products for you, from waterproof mascaras to opaque concealers. Sarah Saril I'm not much of a beauty guru, but I love perfume. My prized Bond NYC bottle is running low, so I'm on the hunt for a new signature scent. When the Skylar Beauty Trial Set came up during Cyber Week, I jumped at the chance to try it out. Skylar is a clean beauty brand and its perfumes are hypoallergenic, vegan, and cruelty-free. The samples in the sale pack include Peach Fields, Vanilla Sky, Lime Sands, Salt Air, and Coconut Cove. I like that the collection is made of simple individual scents that can be paired for more complexity. This winter, I'm looking forward to experimenting with layering Vanilla Sky and Salt Air. Skylar rarely goes on sale, and even in the last few days, we've seen two different sale prices. Right now, you can get the trial set for $12.50, which is the best price we've seen all year. Lily Alig I've tested dozens of robots for our best robot vacuum guide, and one of my all-time favorite vacs is the Bissell SpinWave. It was one of the top picks in our guide for a while, but it's gone in and out of stock over the years, and the price fluctuates dramatically. I'd look elsewhere at its usual $400 price, but at its Cyber Monday special of $145, I strongly recommend it. What sets the Bissell SpinWave apart is its mopping performance. It features spinning mopheads that scrub the floor rather than just move the mess around. The vacuuming performance was also impressive, cleaning up most of the flour, kitty litter, coffee grounds, and pet hair I set out for testing. I especially recommend the Bissell SpinWave to pet lovers. It's great for cleaning up after pets, but it lacks obstacle avoidance in today's high-end robot vacuums. Still, you won't find a better option for automating your floor cleaning at this price point. James Brains Among the best Cyber Monday Apple deals, the Beats Studio Buds are an exceptional budget-to-mid-range wireless earbud option. The Amazon deal for 47% off matches the model's record-low price. I've had the same pair of Beats Studio Buds since 2021. They're a resilient product that has survived myriad forms of water and drop damage while retaining the same reliable, bass-heavy sound. I should note that the Studio Buds are far from the best noise-canceling headphones. I've since upgraded to our guide's top pick for in-ear noise-cancellation, the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra Earbuds (which might also be worth your while at 23% off), to more adequately drown out the din of New York City's streets. However, I've kept the Studio Buds as a trusted backup pair and have come to appreciate their seamless pairing with Apple products relative to the Bose pair's occasionally finicky integration. In certain instances, I prefer the Beats' compact size and fit, even if it sacrifices sound quality compared to the high-end pair. For $80, though, you're sure to get your money's worth. John Lynch Winter is in full swing in Michigan, with wind chills remaining stubbornly in the teens. Yet, I'm just as stubborn when it comes to turning up the thermostat. Why should I crank the heat when I can keep it at a reasonable 64 degrees and just use a space heater if I get cold? This is where the Lasko MyHeat Personal Mini Space Heater comes in. Typically an already-affordable $25, the Lasko MyHeat is marked down to $17 for Cyber Monday. With a flip of the switch, I have instant warm air keeping me comfy at my desk. It occupies minimal space in my cluttered work area and operates quietly, so I can keep it running during meetings. I tested it for our best space heater guide, and it only increased the temperature in my 100-square-foot office by 2.5 degrees. However, it's not meant to heat whole rooms; instead, it offers a personal blast of hot air. If you want extra warmth without the added utility costs of heating your whole living area, I recommend spending the $17 on the Lasko MyHeat space heater deal. James Brains Bombas' massive Cyber Monday sale means everything's 25% off with code "BIGHOLIDAY25." You can feel good about stocking up because Bombas donates one pair of socks to charity for each one purchased, so by shopping tonight, you'll be ahead on your good deed for Giving Tuesday. The latest Bombas style I'm into is the cozy faux sherpa Sunday Slippers. I slide into them first thing in the morning, and they stay on as I get ready for the day, thanks to a raised rear around the heel cup. Their midsoles are made of a plush layer of memory foam laid over an EVA footbed, so the foam won't collapse the more you wear them. Learn why its socks are worth the try in our full Bombas socks review, and check out our guide to the best Bombas Cyber Monday deals. Gabrielle Chase The 2024 MacBook Pro running on the M4 Pro processor comes with 24GB RAM — 6GB more than the 2023 version. Today, the 2024 Pro is $250 off. It's an ideal machine for those who need untamed power in a portable package. The 2023 version is also on sale this Cyber Monday, but it's only $50 less with its deal, so I'd recommend going for the 2024 model. If you're looking for a powerhouse with a more modest price, the 2022 MacBook Air running on the M2 processor with 16GB of RAM is a rare bargain at $800, which is $200 off Apple's full price. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's an "older" model — Apple's M processors have incredible longevity and performance. The newer MacBook Air that runs on the M3 processor is $100 more with its deal, but we don't think the returns are significant enough for the extra money, at least not for those looking for the best value. The latest 15-inch MacBook Air M3 with 16GB RAM for $200 off makes a very tempting case. Its 15-inch display is a tangible upgrade, and the previous generation model is a bad deal with its 8GB of RAM, even if it's $300 off — you should get the latest M3 15-inch model for the newer processor and twice the RAM. Antonio Villas-Boas I wish I had waited until Cyber Monday to purchase the Monos Check-In Large suitcase. You could snag this hard-case check-in bag from one of the best luggage brands for as little as $251, regularly $355. This is the largest version of its standard check-in bag. The deeper savings are only available for select colorways. Monos' durable suitcases have a sleek look similar to Away, another popular luggage maker. I found the spinner wheels, zipper, and handle to perform well. Indeed, when my colleagues tested Monos' carry-on bags, they found them to be some of the best options at their price. That means a Monos sale is worth every penny. The best thing about Monos is that they offer a 100-day trial and free shipping. Provided there isn't damage or usage, you can return a product if it isn't to your liking. Besides Cyber Monday deals, Monos has discounts of up to 40% on select luggage and travel gear sitewide when you use the code CYBERWEEK. Les Shu If you're looking to elevate your camping experience, Solo Stove is offering 50% off its Campfire Gear Kit. The set normally sells for $200 but is down to $100, thanks to being one of many Solo Stove products discounted throughout its site. The Campfire stove works similarly to two of our top-tested recommendations in our best fire pit buying guide: the Solo Stove Bonfire and Solo Stove Mesa. This kit includes the basics: the Campfire camping stove, two pots, a tripod to hang a pot, and a carrying case. As someone who plans to camp more often, I decided the Campfire Gear Kit is a great way to get into cooking outdoors. The stove and pots are lightweight and easy to pack, so I wouldn't need to bring heavier camping cookware or propane gas tanks. While waiting for the fire to burn out, it can double as a small fire pit for making s'mores after dinner. The Bonfire and Mesa fire pits are also on sale, as are other fire pits, pizza ovens, camping stoves, and more outdoor products. It's Solo Stove's biggest sale of the year, so it's a good time to check out its camping and backyard gear. Les Shu As an only-on-New-Years-and-at-weddings drinker, I love when our team covers non-alcoholic spirits and beverages. Our resident whiskey expert, James Brains, has literally traveled up and down the Kentucky bourbon trail developing his palette. Monday is one of his favorite brands for non-alcoholic spirits. During Cyber Week, Monday is offering 30% off everything. The typical $45 price tag is worth it, but $15 off makes it even more compelling. Though we haven't tried the zero-alcohol gin or mezcal yet, we have high hopes based on our experience with the whiskey. James Brains called it "evocative of tootsie rolls" with a pleasant finish. In his blind taste test, the Monday Old Fashioned was the best and closest to the real thing. All the Monday bottles are gorgeous and great as holiday gifts. Shop the bundles or single bottles while the sale lasts. Lily Alig Since my wife's Apple Watch Series 5 started running out of battery before bed, I originally planned on swapping the battery out. I realized that the Apple Watch Series 10 came with so many upgrades that it felt worth buying that instead, especially with the $70 off Cyber Monday discount. My review of the Series 10 is coming, but I already know I love it: the new slim and lightweight design, the latest Vitals feature support in watchOS 11, major performance upgrade, Crash Detection, and fast-charge ability are hits for me and will be for my wife. Plus, she'll finally be able to track her sleep — something she couldn't manage with her old Apple Watch's battery without topping it off just before bed. On a $400 product, $70 might not seem like much of a discount, but it's pretty good for an Apple device that was just released in September. It's the best Apple Watch for most people, and it's going to make a neat, unplanned Christmas present. Antonio Villas-Boas When I research which stylish clothing our readers are most interested in, I also test to make sure they're actually comfortable. The Quince Ultra Stretch Ponte Wide Leg Pants are some of my favorite stretchy work pants I've found — they're from a lightweight Ponte fabric that makes me feel like I'm wearing leggings at work, and only to the untrained eye do they not look like slacks. They come in two inseams and six colors (which may be worth stocking up on while they're on sale for $15 off at $34.90). This pair runs short, so get the 32-inch if you're between lengths. You'll want to be sure of the fit, because the main caveat with the best Quince Cyber Monday deals is that they're non-returnable. Learn more about which Quince's styles we've tried in our full Quince review. Gabrielle Chase. I've tested over 100 mattresses for our best mattress guide, and there's one that blew me away — and I wish I could sleep on it every night — is the Tempur-Pedic Cloud. Right now, it's marked down to $1,399 for a queen, plus you get two free pillows. The all-foam Cloud is Tempur-Pedic's most affordable mattress, which means it's the least you'll pay to sleep on the company's amazing signature foam. I love the Tempur material because it contours to the curves of my body to keep my spine perfectly aligned while relieving pressure points. While testing the Cloud, I fell asleep within minutes each night. This is the mattress I'd buy if I weren't testing new ones every few weeks. The Tempur-Cloud is marked 30% off a few times throughout the year, but I've never seen it marked lower, so if you're looking to upgrade your sleep experience, I'd act on this deal now. With its risk-free home trial, you can return it within 90 days if you don't like it. Check out my full Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress review. James Brains. I scan thousands of deals over the course of the five-day shopping event we in product journalism (sort of) affectionately call "the Turkey Five" and while I see lots of great deals, there's rarely one that stops me in my tracks so abruptly that I have to share it with all my friends. For me, this year, that was Cuyana's sale — specifically its 20% discount on the never discounted System Tote. We named the System Tote the best tote bag we tested because it's chic, durable, and has a clever organization system (hence the name) that we haven't seen in other bags. Instead of a standard array of pockets and accessories, you customize the tote with ad-ons that suit your needs and each component snaps in and out. Not carrying a laptop today? Snap the optional laptop case out and gain back the interior space. One thing that really attracted me to the bag was that it's the nicest-looking tote I've seen that has an optional crossbody strap. Business Insider Reviews' executive editor Sally Kaplan has had a System Tote for about 4 years now, and it's her go-to bag for vacations, flights, weekend trips, and long car rides. "It fits an unbelievable amount of stuff, but it also doesn't look floppy or silly if I just put a few things in it," she says. "On a usual vacation, this bag will hold two pairs of shoes, my giant Dyson blow dryer, a hair brush, my toiletry and makeup bags, a scarf or sweater, and a couple of snacks." The downside is the System Tote is an investment at its normal price, especially if you want a lot of add-on components. I was holding out hope for a sale, but I was shocked to see Cuyana offer a discount this good. Past sales from the brand usually hover around 15% off, if they have a sale at all. I'm not the only one who thinks it's a great deal: there's only one sale color of the 13-inch tote and two colors of the 16-inch tote left in stock (fortunately, they're great colors). Cuyana's whole sale is worth taking a look at, especially since it likely won't come around for another year. We rounded up our picks for the best Cyber Monday Cuyana deals, so you have the absolute highlights. For more about what we love in this brand, check out our Cuyana review. Lauren Savoie. As Business Insider's air fryer expert, I've tested over 60 models for our best air fryer guide. There's one that I consistently recommend when people are considering buying this relatively new appliance: the Beautiful Touchscreen Air Fryer. Right now, it's marked down to an all-time low $59 at Walmart. Beautiful is Drew Barrymore's brand, sold exclusively at Walmart. I love it because it cooks evenly and quickly at a budget price. Though only two colors are on sale, white and Starry Night Blue, you can pick from ten colors, so there's sure to be one that matches your kitchen's decor. The six-quart basket of the Beautiful air fryer holds a lot of food for an air fryer at this price point. I cooked a pound of chicken wings to crispy perfection in 16 minutes. Frozen fries were restaurant-quality in 13. Plus, clean-up was a breeze. You can quickly wipe off the grime from the nonstick interior or pop it in the dishwasher. If you've been on the fence about air-frying, I strongly recommend you take advantage of this deal. With Walmart's 90-day return policy, what have you got to lose? James Brains. That's not a typo, nor is it an introductory offer for a month or two. This bundle gets you Disney+ and Hulu for $2.99 a month for an entire year. It's a genuine mic-dropper of a deal for two excellent streaming services. The caveat, of course, being that this is for the ad-supported tiers of both services. Individually, they're $9.99 a month, but the year-round Duo Bundle merges them into a $10.99 a month offer, so going down to $2.99 is a big deal for sure. You'll need to be a new customer to get this excellent rate, and you're not obliged to keep it for a year as it's a rolling one-month contract. If you let it keep rolling, the price will go up to $10.99 next December (or higher if prices go up by then). My advice: cancel a month early next year, and you'll be eligible for next year's Black Friday promo deal again. Brendan Griffiths. Like Black Friday before it, Cyber Monday sales have been disappointing for anyone looking to pick up an Xbox Series X. Unlike the PS5, Microsoft hasn't bothered with a Slim version and is generally still charging the same price it did for the console at launch over four years ago. However, it has just launched an all-digital Series X in white. And it's $100 cheaper than the disc-based console, thanks to a Cyber Monday deal knocking $50 off. So you can get the white Series X, with no disc drive for $398 at Walmart. That's still a lot of money, given the digital PS5 Slim is only $374 today. That said, if you are happy to forgo physical media, this might be tempting. The excellent Xbox Game Pass is a great subscription to fully embrace all-digital on Microsoft's console as it's absolutely packed with great new games. Brendan Griffiths. While some end dates for Cyber Monday deals are up in the air, Max has confirmed on its site that this massive deal will expire today. It could be midnight PT or maybe even ET, but it's into the final hours for sure. The 70% discount applies to the ad-supported tier, but for the next six months, you'll pay just $2.99 a month for Max, down from the usual $9.99. Given the quality of the shows on offer, this is one of the best Cyber Monday streaming deals we've ever seen. You can cancel before the six months are up if you wish. The offer is only open to new and returning subscribers. Brendan Griffiths. Looking for a pillow upgrade? The Coop's Original Adjustable Pillow is 25% off, the lowest price we've ever seen it go for. Usually $75, it automatically discounts to $56.25 at the checkout at Coop's site. This is the same pillow we put right at the top of our best pillows buying guide. The memory foam inside is shredded and you're encouraged to remove or add more (extra is supplied) to get just the right level of support required, so it's a great match for all sleeper styles. I've just ordered one myself after hearing multiple colleagues rate it so highly (and a bunch of other sites' pillow guides), even if part of me dies inside for spending $56 on a pillow. But seeing as the $20 memory foam one I bought at Amazon in July already feels increasingly flat, it's time to try a proper upgrade. Coop has a wider sale for other pillows and bedding with up to 50% off. You won't see the reduced prices on the item's listing page, just the percentage that's coming off at checkout, which is an odd way of trying to convert a sale, but there we go. Brendan Griffiths. I'd spent a lot of time before Cyber Monday weighing up a new TV. Having just moved to the US, I'm rebooting my entire setup which means picking up a TV and game consoles all over again. Having left an LG C2 behind in the UK, I was weighing up an OLED like the LG C4, Samsung 90D, or maybe even save a few bucks via the LG B4 line. But then I started reading the reviews of the Hisense 7N range and fell down the comparison video rabbit hole reading up on how its Mini-LED 144hz display with Dolby Vision is competitive with TVs more than twice its price. TLDR reader, I bought the 55-inch model for $479 at Best Buy - about half of what I'd budgeted for one of the others mentioned above. It's sat next to me right now, still boxed and unwatched, because I'm here, talking to you. Anyway, if you're tempted, check out; you can see this TV with hundreds smashed off the price of the 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch models at Best Buy. Amazon's deals are $3 cheaper right now, but there's a long wait for delivery on all of them. Want more options? Check out Steven's full list of the best Cyber Monday TV deals. Brendan Griffiths. The regular deal price we see during flagship sale days has finally been beaten. That's quite surprising as the usual discounts from $250 down to $170-$160 already seemed generous enough, especially for an Apple product. Well, we have an all-time low price today: the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro are $154 at Amazon. Despite not having a proper upgrade in a few years, these remain some of the best earbuds on the market, with quality audio and excellent noise-canceling. This is for the newer USB-C model. If you have the original AirPods Pro 2, we wouldn't bother with these, as you're only getting a different charging port and some modest dust resistance. The sound quality and fit remain the same. Brendan Griffiths. Yes, the digital and disc-drive models of the PS5 Slim are still in stock at Amazon. The original non-slim PS5 is no longer in production, so this is the one you want. PS5 stock has been in and out all weekend, but the same record-low prices have been available on the console alone and in a new bundle with free Fortnite DLC. Even if you don't want the Fortnite content, snap that one up anyway, as it's not costing you anything extra. The digital model is down to $374 (down from $450), and the disc-drive version is $75 off at a reduced price of $424. Brendan Griffiths. Jump to

Most Widely Read Newspaper Kindly share this story: Traditional finance, or TradFi, is commonly known as everyday finance. Decentralized finance, its fast-growing alternative, revolves around blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. Given traders’ evolving needs, DTX Exchange (DTX) aims to bridge the gap between decentralized and traditional finance and offer the best experiences. This forward-thinking approach has been hailed as a trailblazer, which isn’t surprising. It will combine key elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges, offering traders the best of both worlds—a new DeFi project to keep on the radar. DTX Exchange (DTX): What it is About DTX Exchange (DTX) is a new player gearing up to shake up the global trading sector and the crypto market. Unlike traditional platforms, it will employ blockchain technology and an asset tokenization model, offering a unique solution to challenges faced by traders and conventional trading platforms. By combining the best elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges, DTX will build the first hybrid trading platform, which is its unique offering. But that isn’t all. It aims to bridge the gap between the crypto world and the traditional financial system through a unified L1 blockchain, VulcanX. For the first time, users will be able to trade over 120,000 asset classes across stocks, bonds, ETFs, commodities and cryptos via a unified crypto wallet. Wallet-based trading, distributed liquidity pools, non-custodial storage and an intuitive user-friendly interface will be some of its distinguishing features. The above will make DTX a strong contender in the $10 billion global trading market, driving huge market demand. Experts listed it among the new DeFi projects worth investing in, positioning DTX Exchange as a must-have crypto. Key Solutions by the DTX Exchange Protocol Addressing challenges faced by the trading industry through various innovations is one of its biggest attractions. Let’s continue with how it aims to transform users’ trading experience. Enhanced Liquidity through Distributed Liquidity Pools: Low or poor liquidity is no doubt one of the pressing challenges within the sector. To address this, DTX will combine funds from various sources, allowing the platform to offer competitive and consistent prices to traders. Non-Custodial Storage for Improved Security: Centralization and the risk associated with centralized custody solutions have become critical issues in the trading scene. Its non-custodial model will give users full control of their private keys and assets—their private keys, their assets. Tokenization for Asset Classes Expansion: Its tokenized assets will represent real-world financial instruments, commodities and tangible assets. This model will represent traditional assets on the blockchain, allowing users to invest in the global trading market. Wallet-Based Trading and Financial Inclusion: The exchange protocol will embrace financial inclusion by allowing direct trading from crypto wallets without requiring traditional bank accounts. With users able to participate in global financial markets, it is set for adoption and is arguably the best crypto to invest in. New DeFi Coin With 100x Upside Potential As one of the fastest-growing new ICOs, its massive upside potential has captured whale and retail attention. Over $9 million has been raised in funding amid soaring demand, positioning it as this quarter’s best presale. In the sixth round of the ICO, a token costs only $0.12, which is not only cheaper than most top altcoins but also more promising. With its debut around the corner, a 100x gain is projected—perhaps the best new crypto to invest in.

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more Whether you're a gamer or know one yourself, Cyber Monday's gaming deals are worth checking out for upgrading your devices and curating gifts. However, we recommend you snag them fast since the best Cyber Monday gaming deals are likely going to expire after today. Gaming consoles, Switch accessories, and PC peripherals are all on sale for all-time low prices. The highly-coveted PS5 Digital Edition is $75 off. Meanwhile, you can save $50 on the Xbox Series X Digital Edition. PC gamers can also secure deep discounts on powerful gaming laptops, like this Dell system with an Intel Core i9 and RTX 4070 for $200 off. Find the best Cyber Monday gaming deals on products we recommend below. If you're gift shopping, check out our guide to the best Cyber Monday deals for sales across all categories, including home, kitchen, tech, and more. For Cyber Monday, Nintendo is offering a great bundle that includes a Switch console, a free copy of Mario Kart 8, and a one-year Nintendo Switch online membership. The bundle was available for $50 off, but that deal sold out. However, even at full price the bundle still saves you about $80 compared to buying the console, game, and membership separately. This bundle includes a standard Nintendo Switch console, a download code for Mario Kart 8, and a 12-month membership to Nintendo Switch online. Even at full price, this package already saves you about $80 compared to buying the console, game, and subscription separately. Highlights Inspired by Nintendo's popular Legend of Zelda franchise, this bundle includes a gold-colored Switch Lite console and a 12-month membership to Nintendo Switch Online. The typical combined price of both items would be $250, so this bundle saves you around $40. The 8BitDo Ultimate is comfortable, highly customizable, and comes with a convenient charging dock. The PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller for Nintendo Switch is a full-sized gamepad that offers bigger buttons, better joysticks, and extra customizable buttons. The Spectra model also has color-changing LED lights. The Tomtoc Carrying Case comes with an integrated stand that lets you play your Switch while charging it. This Ivoler case can be carried with a handle or shoulder strap. It's big enough to fit a Switch, dock, controller, and 18 game cards. Microsoft is offering an excellent selection of Cyber Monday gaming deals, including discounts on various Xbox consoles and accessories. The Xbox Series X Digital Edition is down to an all-time low of $398 while the 512GB Xbox Series S is $50 off at Walmart. This Series X model offers the same graphical performance as the standard edition but it does not include a disc drive. It typically costs $50 less than the disc-drive model. The Xbox Series S isn't as powerful as the Series X, but it still benefits from Xbox Game Pass and Microsoft's robust online services, offering great value for less money. The iconic Xbox Core controller works with various Xbox systems, but it can also connect to your PC, iPhone, iPad, or Android. Microsoft’s official battery pack for the Xbox wireless controller replaces the standard AA batteries and can be charged with the controller’s usual USB cable. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X shares many features with the more expensive Nova Pro, like a noise-canceling microphone and wireless cross-platform support, while maintaining a midrange price. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers a Netflix-style subscription with hundreds of games for Xbox and PC, along with online multiplayer support. Members can also stream games on mobile devices, Samsung TVs, and select Fire TV sticks. An Ultimate membership typically costs $20, but most retailers sell one month for $17. PlayStation 5 systems and accessories are seeing great discounts for Cyber Monday. The Digital Edition console is down to a new low of $374. Meanwhile, the PS5 with disc drive is available for $75 off, and this PS VR2 bundle is a whopping $250 off. And though not discounted, the brand-new PS5 Pro is in stock for its regular price of $699. The PS5 is one of the best gaming consoles you can buy thanks to its powerful hardware, unique controller, and exclusive games. This model includes a disc drive and some free Fortnite content, like in-game outfits and weapons. The PS5 Slim Digital Edition doesn't include a disc drive, but you can buy one later on for $80 if you decide you want to play game discs later on. This package features some Fortnite-related freebies, including in-game outfits and weapons. This bundle includes a slim disc-drive edition PlayStation 5 console with a copy of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the latest entry in the popular action RPG franchise. With this bundle, buyers get a slim PlayStation 5 console with disc drive and a copy of Madden NFL 25, the latest game in the long-running football series. The PS VR2 is a virtual reality headset built for the PS5. It also supports a PC adapter (sold separately for $60) that can pair with computers to play SteamVR games. This bundle includes a copy of Horizon Call of the Mountain. Sony's DualSense controller improves on the classic PlayStation design with haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, USB-C, charging, a built-in mic, and a longer battery life. These wireless earbuds are designed for gaming with a PS5 or PC. They support active noise cancellation and a 2.4GHz wireless connection for lag-free playback. This wired gaming headset has a white color scheme that's designed to match the PS5 console. It has a boom microphone for voice chat that can be flipped up to mute. You can now snag a Quest 3S bundle that includes the 128GB headset, the new Batman: Arkham Shadow game, and a three-month Meta Quest+ subscription for a total of $299. You can learn more about the 3S VR headset in our Meta Quest 3S review. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The larger 256GB model of the new Quest 3S is for the more dedicated VR fan keen on downloading and storing a larger number of games and apps at once. VR newcomers would be better off saving some cash with the 128GB model in our book, though. Otherwise, you're getting the same excellent value headset, and all purchases currently include a code for the super-fun Batman: Arkham Shadow game (a $50 value). You're also getting three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The slightly older Meta Quest 3 VR headset builds on its predecessor with mixed reality capabilities, 4K resolution, an upgraded processor that offers double the speed, and new ergonomics for the head unit and controllers. Like the newer 3S model it also comes with a free download code for the new Batman: Arkham Shadow VR game (worth $50). The larger 512GB version is the only one remaining, as the smaller ones have now been discontinued. PC and laptop gamers can save tons on new systems during Cyber Monday. Right now, the Asus TUG A15 gaming laptop is down to $999 which is just $20 more than the lowest price it's ever dipped to. We're also seeing great deals on monitors, like this 50% discount on Samsung's 43-inch Odyssey Neo G7. The Asus TUF is built with military-grade shock resistance, and its incredibly powerful battery can last for around nine hours on a single charge. This model of the X16 R2 by Asus has powerful specs to run almost any demanding game at high frames-per-second on its large 16-inch QHD 240Hz display. Alienware's AW3225QF is the first 4K QD-OLED monitor and one of the few 4K displays you can get with a 240Hz refresh rate. It's expensive but delivers stunning performance while setting a new benchmark for gaming displays. The Samsung Odyssey Neo series offers 4K image quality in a sleek and stylish package. They’re among the best gaming monitors on the market. The Asus ROG Ally is a handheld gaming PC with Windows 11. Its hardware is powerful enough to run nearly any game, but its control issues make it awkward to use. The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro delivers smooth movement, cool RGB lighting, plenty of buttons, and a high-quality design that feels great in-hand. It’s our pick for the best wireless gaming mouse you can buy. The Logitech G305 Lightspeed is an excellent choice for entry-level users, casual gamers, and those shopping on a budget. Despite being one of the most affordable wireless gaming mice on the market, it doesn't compromise quality or performance, and it's almost always on sale. See more of our Cyber Monday roundups The PS5 and Xbox Series X are both powerful gaming consoles with similar graphical capabilities. However, they each have pros and cons. Our gaming experts think the PS5 has an edge in exclusive games, with franchises like Marvel's Spider-Man, The Last of Us, God of War, Ratchet & Clank, Astro Bot, and Ghosts of Tsushima that you can't play on Xbox systems. We also prefer the PS5's DualSense controller since it has extra perks like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. Xbox consoles have their own exclusive titles as well, including Halo and Starfield, but the selection isn't as large and Microsoft is starting to experiment with releasing some of its first-party games on the PS5. However, the Xbox Series X has an edge in multimedia capabilities and its Game Pass subscription service, which offers tons of titles, including brand-new releases the day they launch in stores. Ultimately, you can't go wrong with either system, but the PS5's exclusive titles and unique controller make it a slightly better option for gamers who don't want to miss out on big releases. Check out our PS5 vs. Xbox Series X comparison for more details. Top gaming PCs and laptops feature components built to handle modern games at stable frame rates, along with support for features like ray tracing and AI upscaling. This makes them notably more expensive than typical computers designed for everyday use. High-end gaming desktops and laptops can cost more than $3,000 but entry-level options with solid specifications can be found for around $800 to $1,000. When shopping for a gaming computer the most important spec to look at is the graphics card. Nvidia and AMD are the top brands in graphics cards, and they both sell excellent options. However, Nvidia's top GPUs are typically more powerful, and the company's RTX 40-series cards have a feature called "Deep Learning Super Sampling" (DLSS), which can improve frame rates with AI. Meanwhile, AMD's graphics cards tend to be a little less powerful by are also often less expensive. For the best gaming performance, we recommend focusing on PCs and laptops that have an Nvidia RTX 4050 graphics card or higher. Shopping for more discounts today?

Title: Intel’s Turnaround CEO Pat Gelsinger Steps Down, Ending a Long Tenure at the Chipmaker

Time Published: 2024-12-02T18:26:13Z

After nearly four years of attempting to turn around Intel’s struggling semiconductor business, Pat Gelsinger is out as the company’s CEO. His resignation ends a tenure marked by plunging profits and a failure to capitalize on the A.I. boom that lifted rivals like Nvidia. “We know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” said Frank Yeary, a longtime Intel board member who will act as its interim executive chair in light of Gelsinger’s departure, in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel.” Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Gelsinger, 63, stepped down as CEO and left Intel’s board effective yesterday (Dec. 1), the chipmaker announced today in a press release. David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, two senior Intel executives, will act as co-CEOs while the company’s board works to find a permanent successor. Zinsner is currently the company’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, while Holthaus has been appointed to the newly created position of head of Intel Products and will oversee its client computing, data center and A.I., and network groups. Intel shares rose 4 percent today in response to the news. The resignation caps more than 30 years at Intel for Gelsinger, who first joined the company as a teenager in 1979 and went on to become its first chief technology officer at the turn of the century before leaving Intel in 2009. After taking a senior position at the tech company EMC and serving as the CEO of the cloud computing player VMware, Gelsinger in 2021 returned to Intel to take over from then-CEO Bob Swan. Despite ambitions to regain Intel’s leadership in the semiconductor industry, the company in recent years has failed to catch up with competitors and has seen its share price plunge by about 50 percent in 2024 alone. At the center of Gelsinger’s turnaround plan was a strategy to branch into contract manufacturing to compete with rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a major supplier to U.S. chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD) and Qualcomm. In the meantime, the company has also pivoted to making A.I. accelerators to compete with industry leaders like Nvidia, but with little success—Intel’s current market cap is only 3 percent of Nvidia’s. Intel is one of the largest beneficiaries of the Biden administration’s Chips and Science Act, which is awarding the company nearly $7.9 billion in federal grants to expand its domestic manufacturing network—about a quarter of Intel’s cost of goods sold in 2023. Gelsinger’s ousting also came amid rumblings of activist investor interest in Intel. The company, which in October reported its largest-ever quarterly loss of $16.6 billion, reportedly tapped advisors like Morgan Stanley (MS) earlier this year to defend itself from activist pressure. “Today is, of course, bittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career,” said Gelsinger in a statement. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Shares of Intel (INTC-5.26% jumped 5% as the company announced Monday that CEO Pat Gelsinger is retiring from the company and has stepped down from its board of directors. The move comes as the chip-maker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors such as Nvidia (NVDA-0.04%) amid the artificial intelligence boom. Tesla shares rose 3% after Roth MKM upgraded the stock from “Neutral” to “Buy,” setting a price target of $380 (up from $85). The firm cited the potential impact of CEO Elon Musk’s close relationship with President-elect Donald Trump as a catalyst for the upgrade, suggesting it could bolster Tesla’s prospects in the coming months. Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI-1.52%) soared 23% on Monday morning following the announcement that an independent special committee had concluded its investigation into the company’s operations and found no evidence of misconduct by the company’s management or board of directors. –Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel Corp. (INTC, Financials) announced that co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus would succeed Pat Gelsinger, who will retire on Dec. 1. Gelsinger also left Intel's board. INTC stock is up 4% in Monday morning trading following the news. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MU. Holthaus will also assume the newly established Intel Products CEO post. Frank Yeary is designated temporary executive chair. Intel is trying to become more competitive in semiconductor production and negotiate continuous obstacles, including pressure on its foundry operations, hence the leadership transition comes as natural. Previously running Intel's Client Computing Group, Holthaus will concentrate on centralizing resources for the product group. Joined Intel in 2022 Zinsner, a former executive vice president and CFO of Micron Technology (MU, Financials). KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts said that the action would show Intel's readiness to sell its foundry business, a prospect considered positive by some investors. Analyzers also pointed out the difficulties in selecting a leader suited to handle Intel's wide-ranging problems. Intel has had challenges growing its foundry operations to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM, Financials) and understood pressure from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD, Financials) and NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA, Financials) in artificial intelligence. Aiming to save $10 billion in expenses and simplify operations, the business announced in August a 15% personnel cut. Intel reported a net loss of $0.46 per share in the most recent quarter as income dropped 6.2% year over year to $13.28 billion. Foundry income fell 8% to $4.4 billion during the same time frame. Part of its cost-cutting initiatives, the corporation also noted a $2.8 billion restructuring expense. Under the CHIPs Act, Intel this week earned a $7.86 billion grant, a drop from an earlier $8.5 billion allocation to improve manufacturing headquartered in the United States.

Intel (INTC-5.26%) shares climbed by over 4% during mid-day trading on Monday after the company announced that its chief executive is out. After over four decades at the chip pioneer, Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger retired from the company and stepped down from its board of directors on Sunday, Intel said. Intel chief financial officer David Zinsner and chief executive of Intel Products Michelle Johnston Holthaus will now serve as interim co-CEOs while Intel’s board looks for another leader. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board, will become its interim executive chair. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. Intel’s shares, which have fallen over 47% so far this year, were up by about 4.4% amid the news, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM+1.74%) U.S.-listed shares were up by almost 5%, and British chip designer Arm’s (ARM-2.37%) shares were up by 4.5%. Gelsinger’s stepping down comes as the chipmaker loses ground to competitors including Nvidia (NVDA-0.04%), which has benefitted from the artificial intelligence boom. In late November, the U.S. Commerce Department finalized Intel’s Chips Act funding of up to $7.86 billion — less than the proposed $8.5 billion announced in March. However, the finalized direct funding is in addition to a $3 billion contract Intel was awarded under a part of the Chips Act known as the Secure Enclave. The program is meant to expand manufacturing of cutting-edge chips for the U.S. government. With its Chips Act funding, Intel plans to expand its U.S. semiconductor industry footprint with chipmaking and advanced packaging sites in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon — an investment worth more than $100 billion. Meanwhile, Intel was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in November and replaced by Nvidia. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board, will become its interim executive chair. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. Intel’s shares, which have fallen over 47% so far this year, were up by about 4.4% amid the news, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM+1.74%) U.S.-listed shares were up by almost 5%, and British chip designer Arm’s (ARM-2.37%) shares were up by 4.5%. Gelsinger’s stepping down comes as the chipmaker loses ground to competitors including Nvidia (NVDA-0.04%), which has benefitted from the artificial intelligence boom. In late November, the U.S. Commerce Department finalized Intel’s Chips Act funding of up to $7.86 billion — less than the proposed $8.5 billion announced in March. However, the finalized direct funding is in addition to a $3 billion contract Intel was awarded under a part of the Chips Act known as the Secure Enclave. The program is meant to expand manufacturing of cutting-edge chips for the U.S. government. With its Chips Act funding, Intel plans to expand its U.S. semiconductor industry footprint with chipmaking and advanced packaging sites in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon — an investment worth more than $100 billion. Meanwhile, Intel was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in November and replaced by Nvidia. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Once again, we have collected all of the most notable deals now live for Cyber Monday right here, but there are some standouts we want to highlight before select gear starts to sell out (some of it already is). Firstly, the official Samsung Cyber Monday sale is now in full swing with hundreds in savings on its latest smartphones, monitors, smart TVs, and more, not to mention some even deeper deals on its Smart Monitors. We have your last shot at the Google Black Friday event, Alexa smart speakers at just $15.50 a pop, and much more. Head below for today’s Cyber Monday edition 9to5Toys Lunch Break. Samsung has officially transitioned over from its Black Friday sale and is now offering some solid deals as a part of its Cyber Monday sale. While there are some great deals on the brand’s latest gear from other retailers, its website features loads of deep deals as well with huge discounts, freebies, elevated trade-in offers, and more. Samsung’s official Black Friday landing page is now populated with a bunch of fresh Cyber Monday offers, and you can check out the details below to find the best deals. As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is offering Samsung’s latest 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G95C) gaming monitor for $759.98 shipped. This particular gaming display has been sitting at the $1,000 mark lately with some occasional jumps to its full $1,300 price. Today’s 42% or $540 discount on its listed price knocks this model $40 below its previous Amazon all-time low, marking a new low price to beat. The same monitor is currently fetching $800 directly at Samsung as a part of its ongoing Black Friday sale, and you can learn more about it below. The official Samsung Black Friday sale continues and we are now tracking even deeper deals on its latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6. Both of these handsets debuted earlier this year as the brand’s latest and greatest in foldable handsets and we are now tracking massive price drops on unlocked units with as much as $800 in savings before you even factor in the trade-in values. Scope out the details below. After dishing out its official 18-page Black Friday Holiday Gift Guide last week, Razer has now kicked off its main Black Friday 2024 sale event with huge savings of up to 60%. The brand is calling it the Cyber Weekend Specials and offering a ton of fresh deals on everything from gaming peripherals to big ticket items like its Blade gaming laptops. It’s even offering a “mystery Razer Swag item” with orders above $199 while stock lasts on its site. All of that and more discounted pieces of Razer gaming gear are waiting for you down below. The Samsung Black Friday sale is now live, but so is the Amazon Black Friday Week Deals, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro price drops are now at the ready. While you will find the regularly $250 flagship earbuds marked down to $189.99 shipped directly from Samsung, Amazon is sweetening the pot significantly with its own deal price at $188.98 shipped alongside a FREE $20 Amazon gift card with purchase. That’s a total value of $270 and of $81 in effective savings when you factor in the value of the gift card you’ll be able to use towards additional Black Friday deals if you order sooner than not. As per usual, if you have some gear to trade-in against the new Galaxy Buds Pro 3, you can score an up to $100 instant trade-in credit against the already marked down purchase price here. That would leave you with a price at $90 for the new 2024 in-ears, and the lowest price on the internet, but only if you have some gear to flip in the holster. As you likely by now, the official 2024 Google Black Friday sale is live with the best deals we have tracked on just about all of its latest Pixel gear. But for folks not bothered by the latest and greatest releases, the Pixel Watch 2 just dropped to a new Amazon all-time low as part of the retailer’s Black Friday Week Deals. You’ll now find Pixel Watch 2 in various colorways starting down at $145 shipped, or $105 under the current going rate. It is important to remember, however, that this smartwatch carried a regular price of $350 before Google officially lowered the MSRP when the Pixel Watch 3 released. The official Samsung Black Friday sale is now live with massive price drops on a huge selection of its latest tech, wearables, smartphones, and smart TVs included. You will find its latest Galaxy Watch 7 now starting down at $239.99 in the 40mm size alongside the 44mm going for $269.99 shipped, but Amazon now has those prices beat. While the band color and style options are a little bit more limited at Amazon, you’ll now find the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 starting down at $202.60 and the 44mm model starting at $247.48 shipped. Regularly $300 and $330, respectively, you’re looking at nearly $100 in savings here – more specifically over $97 and $82 off. Update: The deals below also now come along with a $90 Amazon credit! If you were waiting for Black Friday 2024 deals to cop Ray-Ban’s Meta smart glasses, then now is your time to strike as they’re seeing a 20% discount right now. This Black Friday offer, which is now live at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and even Meta’s online store, applies to every frame and style of the Meta Ray-Bans including Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner starting from $239.20 shipped. This is the best deal we’ve tracked for this piece of wearable that hasn’t seen many discounts, so you might want to grab them while supplies last. Head below for more details. The official OnePlus Black Friday deals are now live and up for grabs directly from the official OnePlus site. Spanning its entire range of latest-generation tech, from the OnePlus 12 and Open foldable right through to the Watch 2R, pro-grade buds, and the OnePlus Tab 2, we are looking at some of the best prices of the year. Head below for a rundown of the exact Black Friday OnePlus deal prices – there’s up to $500 off smartphones as well as a host of freebie earbud add-ons thrown in across the lineup alongside the straight up cash markdowns here. OnePlus Black Friday smartphone deals OnePlus Watch Black Friday deals OnePlus Buds Black Friday deals OnePlus Pad Black Friday deals While we are now seeing sizable price drops on the Samsung Frame smart TVs at up to $1,300 off, the 2024 Hisense models are now also sitting at Amazon all-time lows as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. The Hisense CanvasTV delivers a very smilier picture frame-style experience as Samsung, just at a much lower price and with a display running on the Google TV platform. The 55-inch model is now on sale for $699.99 shipped and the 75-incher is going for $799.99 shipped. Regularly $1,000 and $1,300, respectively, you’re looking at 30% price drops to deliver the lowest prices we can find. The super rare deals in the Arc Black Friday sale are now live. We have already featured the offers available on the brand’s popular Bumper Cases for iPhone, and now it’s time to look at the Samsung Galaxy side of the lineup. Price drops on the brand’s popular bumper-style cases are rare at best, outside of our exclusive discounts that is, but the Black Friday deals are offering 15% off sitewide to deliver the best deals we have tracked all year. You’ll find options for the Samsung S24 Ultra as well as the previous-generation S23 and S22 Ultra models starting from just over $38 right now – click this link and hit up the pull-down menu in the top left corner to find the Galaxy models (final discounted prices appear in the cart). Head below for more details. As part of its now live early access Black Friday deals, Samsung is offering up to $1,300 in savings on its latest model The Frame smart TVs. While several models and sizes are now either matching or slightly below our previous mentions directly from Samsung, you’ll also want to double check with Amazon as it is now doing its usual thing, slightly undercutting the direct prices by a few bucks on several sizes. Pricing kicks off from $550 shipped today (or $548 over at Amazon) and you can head below to scope out the deals across the various sizes of the 2024 Samsung The Frame lineup.

Title: Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger pushed out following tumultuous tenure leading the chip giant

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) announced Monday that CEO Pat Gelsinger retired effective Dec. 1 and stepped down from the company's board of directors. Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around the troubled US chipmaker for more than three years. Intel stock was up roughly 5% on the news midday before reversing direction. Shares fell as much as 2% in afternoon trading. A person familiar with the matter told Yahoo Finance that the board had lost confidence in Gelsinger and a change was needed ahead of 2025. The person added the decision was made by a small group of people inside Intel, and the leadership team was only made aware Sunday afternoon. It's unclear if Intel will continue with Gelsinger's expensive expansion into making chips for other companies, the source said. Intel has named CFO David Zinsner and former head of client computing Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-CEOs. Holthaus was also named Intel Products CEO. The company said its board has formed a search committee and “will work diligently and expeditiously to find a permanent successor to Gelsinger.” “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Intel's board chair Frank Yeary said in a statement. Intel is facing two separate lawsuits filed this year by investors claiming they were misled about the company's financial performance. The latest was filed by a pension fund in August following the chipmaker's announcement that it would slash 15,000 jobs. Gelsinger had previously spent 30 years at Intel but left in 2009. He rejoined the company in 2021, taking over the role of chief executive from Bob Swan. Gelsinger promised that his tenure would bring back a “Grovian” mindset to the company and right years of missteps that saw Intel lose its edge in the chip market to artificial intelligence chip design leader Nvidia (NVDA) and chip manufacturing giant TSMC (TSM). That goal referred to former CEO Andy Grove, who oversaw a spectacular turnaround for the company in the 1980s when Intel struggled to maintain its dominance in the memory chip market amid competition from Japan — and made a dramatic shift toward producing another kind of chip, called CPUs, of which it became the leading manufacturer. Many of the problems facing Intel predate Gelsinger's tenure and will remain a challenge for its next leadership group. Intel is grappling with a slump in PC chip sales that’s only just beginning to improve and increased competition in that market from AMD (AMD) and British chip designer Arm (ARM), all while the CPU market as a whole is threatened by the rise of GPU chips, which are used to run generative artificial intelligence — a market dominated by Nvidia. As Intel CEO, Gelsinger sought to bolster the company's foundry business by making chips for external customers. Intel makes its own chips but had never produced semiconductors for external customers, and its own chipmaking processes faced delays beginning in the mid-2010s. Gelsinger undertook aggressive efforts to improve Intel's manufacturing processes — which he outlined at the start of his time as CEO in 2021 — that aimed to reverse the foundry's former failures in five years. Intel has recently focused on upgrading to a manufacturing process called 18A that would allow it to directly compete with TSMC as a producer of AI chips. Gelsinger's departure casts doubt on the company's focus on its service foundry, which could affect Intel's ability to catch up in the AI space, according to analysts. "[W]hile keeping [the foundries] feels like deadweight (and a continuation of the strategy that got Pat out), scrapping them would also be fraught with difficulties around the product roadmap, outsourcing strategy, CHIPS act, and political navigation," Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a client note Monday. In late November, Intel was officially awarded $7.86 billion in CHIPS Act funding for its semiconductor manufacturing and packaging operations in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. The company also recently announced plans to split its foundry business into an independent subsidiary, and Gelsinger's exit could accelerate that change, according to Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri. The move toward Intel's money-losing chip manufacturing business has so far failed to bolster faith in the company. Intel has recently become a takeover target, and shares of the company are down more than 50% for the year. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up 26%. Intel stock was recently replaced by Nvidia in the Dow. As Bernstein's Rasgon wrote, "There don’t seem to be any easy answers here, so whoever winds up filling the slot looks in for a tough ride."

Title: Intel just ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger as it struggles to compete in the AI era

Manage your account Intel (INTC) announced Monday that chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger is retiring from the company and has stepped down from its board of directors. The move comes as the chipmaker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors like Nvidia (NVDA) amid the artificial intelligence boom. In recent months, Intel has also been the subject of activist investor interest — including a potential takeover bid — as its performance continues to lag. As the board searches for a new chief, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant named David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-CEOs. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board and its interim executive chair, said the pair will continue the company’s mission to simplify and strengthen Intel’s product portfolio and advance manufacturing and foundry capabilities while cutting costs. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,” Yeary said. Intel stock was up about 4% in pre-market trading on Monday. The company’s shares have shed roughly 50% of their value so far this year. Gelsinger returned to Intel as CEO in 2021, replacing Bob Swan, to help modernize — and stabilize — the company, to little avail. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,” Gelsinger said in a statement Monday. The company has taken several measures to kickstart its sputtering performance. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. That included reducing its headcount by roughly 15,000, or 15% of its workforce. Gelsinger said at the time that these were the “most consequential changes” in the company’s history. As part of the restructuring plan, Intel took a $2.8 billion charge in the third quarter. The company saw a 6% year-over-year decline in revenues in the three months ended Sept. 28, for a net loss of $16.99 billion, or $3.88 per share. Intel also reportedly hired Morgan Stanley and other advisors to help fend off potential activist investors, according to CNBC (CMCSA). Early last month, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises 30 leading U.S. stocks, to make room for Nvidia as the index shifts toward AI pioneers. For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Trump's plan to slash the corporate income tax rate for domestic manufacturers would fuel a multitrillion investment while he's in office. Nvidia topped analyst estimates across all metrics on its third quarter earnings call. $83 billion has just been sitting there underground this whole time. Nvidia continues to be the runaway leader in chips used for artificial intelligence (AI). The company's leading position in the data center market has driven triple-digit revenue growth over the last few years. Nvidia is now one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a $3.4 trillion market cap at present. A falling-interest-rate environment is generally a positive catalyst for the stock market. Having said that, there are some areas of the stock market that tend to benefit from falling rates more than others. One in particular is real estate, and it could be a great time to shop for top-notch real estate stocks while the Federal Reserve is still in the early stages of its rate-cutting cycle. Advanced Micro Devices could disrupt Nvidia's dominance in the market for data center chips. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are two of the most popular stocks among retail investors, but the billionaires listed below bought one and sold the other in the third quarter. Cliff Asness at AQR Capital Management purchased 719,710 shares of Nvidia, increasing his stake by 5%. Nvidia is now the largest holding in the portfolio, and Apple is the second largest. The chipmaker is considering at least two people outside the company to replace former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who abruptly retired on Sunday. Last quarter, Coatue Management upped its stake in Constellation Energy by more than 57%.

The problem with amazing growth stocks is that when the market discovers them, enthusiastic investors can often converge on them quickly, sending the price through the roof. Instead, it creates unnecessary volatility and a stock price that can undermine an otherwise healthy investment thesis. Prices need to be tied to some intrinsic value measure to make sense. Intel on Thursday named two chip industry veterans to its board, as the struggling semiconductor firm looks for a new top boss following the recent ouster of Pat Gelsinger and tries to reclaim its lost glory. The chipmaker said Eric Meurice, former CEO of chipmaking equipment provider ASML, and Steve Sanghi, interim CEO of Microchip Technology, are the new additions to its board. AT&T (NYSE: T) recently unveiled its updated strategic plan, providing investors with financial guidance through 2027.

Meanwhile, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- which is heavily invested in AI through its stake in ChatGPT's parent, OpenAI -- has risen a poky 14.7%. The analyst in question is Citibank's co-head of U.S. software equity research, Tyler Radke, who has been following Microsoft since 2021. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) both are playing key roles in one of today's hottest growth areas: artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia sells graphics processing units (GPUs) that power critical tasks such as the training and inferencing of models, along with many other related products and services. Supermicro is a behind-the-scenes player, integrating these and other top AI chips into its servers and workstations for data centers. Amidst a backdrop of record highs in major U.S. indices and geopolitical developments influencing market sentiment, investors are increasingly seeking stability through reliable dividend stocks. With the S&P 500 marking its longest winning streak in over two months, finding stocks that offer consistent income can be an effective strategy to navigate current economic uncertainties and capitalize on robust market performance. Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ) stock gained a lot of attention recently after it was added to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio of stock holdings. While investors love to follow Warren Buffett's moves, it likely wasn't his stock pick given the relatively small size of the purchase. Instead, it was likely bought by one of Berkshire's two other investment managers, Ted Weschler or Todd Combs. We break down what you need to earn to afford a $400,000 home in the United States.

Shares of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) more than tripled over the last 12 months, with most of that gain coming in just the last three months. Since the beginning of September, the stock has rocketed 134% at the time of this writing and commands a rich valuation of 64 times trailing-12-month revenue and 187 times this year's consensus earnings estimate. It's fair to say Palantir might be the most loved artificial intelligence (AI) stock on Wall Street right now.

In the Chinese futures market, agricultural product futures play a crucial role. While previous studies have primarily relied on historical price data and fundamental financial indicators of agricultural product futures, there is a growing recognition of the value that lies within the vast amounts of textual data generated in the financial domain. Our study specifically focuses on the limitations of existing methods in capturing the complex relationships and rich semantic information embedded in these textual sources. This article designs a CIMA AttGRU (CIMA-AttGRU) model for soybean futures, which is a forecasting method for the agricultural product market. This model uniquely integrates Collective Intrinsic Mode Analysis (CIMA) with an Attention-Gated Recurrent Unit (AttGRU), leveraging the strengths of both techniques to enhance predictive accuracy and adaptability. The rationale behind employing the CIMA-AttGRU model lies in its ability to effectively tackle the inherent challenges of financial market analysis. By incorporating CIMA, the model adeptly filters out market noise, directly addressing the challenge of high volatility. Additionally, with its attention mechanism, the CIMA-AttGRU targets the issue of non-linear patterns by allowing dynamic adjustment to temporal dependencies, offering differential learning capabilities crucial for capturing the nuanced fluctuations in futures prices. Complementing the CIMA and AttGRU, the integration of Class-wise Adversarial Domain Adaptation (CADA) further refines the model’s robustness, addressing the critical challenge of domain adaptivity. This aspect is particularly vital for edamame futures, where price determinants can vary significantly over time and across regions. Our empirical results demonstrate a significant improvement in forecasting precision, with the CIMA-AttGRU model achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reduction of 15% and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) reduction of 20% compared to conventional models. This superior performance, especially in terms of prediction accuracy and handling market fluctuations, highlights the improve of the model compared to existing methods and has made significant explorations in agricultural market forecasting.

In the diverse landscape of China’s futures market, agricultural product futures occupy a pivotal position, reflecting their significant influence on both the economy and food security [1]. Among these products, edamame stands out due to its unique position in the market and its broader implications on economic trends [2]. Traditionally, stock market analysis has relied heavily on quantitative financial data. However, the increasing availability of textual data, such as earnings call transcripts, financial news, and social media discussions, presents an untapped opportunity to enhance market prediction accuracy. This study explores the integration of natural language processing techniques with financial data analysis to leverage the semantic content of textual data for improved stock price volatility forecasting. Considering the close relationship between the prices of edamame futures and their spot market values, we posit that accurate forecasting of edamame futures prices is a critical yet challenging endeavor, amplified by the commodity’s unique market dynamics. This correlation implies that fluctuations in the spot market can have immediate and significant impacts on futures prices, necessitating a nuanced approach to prediction. The futures market, characterized by its nonlinear trends and volatile patterns, demands advanced forecasting methods. In this regard, the advent of deep learning has marked a significant advancement. Deep learning, especially models designed for nonlinear time series prediction, offers robust tools for deciphering the complex patterns inherent in futures prices [3]. However, traditional models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [4] encounter challenges such as vanishing and exploding gradients, particularly with extended time series data. This limitation highlights the necessity for innovative deep learning approaches, perhaps incorporating techniques like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks [5] or attention mechanisms [6], which are better equipped to manage the complexities of long-term futures price prediction and could provide more accurate and reliable forecasts for stakeholders in the edamame market. To address the limitations of traditional RNNs, LSTM units were developed, which enhance RNNs with gate units and an additional input variable to combat the vanishing gradient problem. While LSTMs alleviate the short-term memory limitations of RNNs, their complex structure of four fully connected layers can result in increased training times and a higher parameter count. In response, Gate Recurrent Units (GRU) [7] were proposed as an evolution of LSTM. GRUs streamline the architecture by combining the hidden layer and cell state and reducing the number of gate units to two. Empirical studies have demonstrated that GRUs can outperform RNNs and LSTMs in terms of parameter update speed and training efficiency, achieving similar predictive results with greater efficiency. However, both LSTM and GRU models, despite their advancements over RNNs, face challenges in capturing complex relationships in extended data series. They often struggle to extract pivotal internal correlations and identify significant feature combinations for accurate prediction. To overcome this, we introduce the AttGRU model, which incorporates an Attention mechanism within the GRU framework. This integration enables the AttGRU to focus more effectively on relevant features and internal correlations, thereby enhancing its learning capabilities from historical data. Despite these improvements, handling random noise in historical data remains a significant challenge. To tackle this issue, we employ CIMA for its efficacy in noise reduction. The proposed hybrid CIMA-AttGRU prediction model combines the noise-filtering capabilities for CIMA with the advanced feature extraction and focus of AttGRU. This synergistic approach allows for more nuanced and accurate predictions in the futures market, addressing both the intricacies of the data and the inherent noise, and setting a new benchmark in futures price forecasting. Furthermore, we tackle the challenge of data migration in time series analysis, a common occurrence in futures markets where changes over time can lead to domain shifts. Domain shifts refer to the scenario where the statistical properties of the data change, which can significantly impact the accuracy of predictive models. To address this, we introduce the CADA algorithm. CADA enhances the robustness of the feature extractor against these domain variances. It operates by aligning the current training data more closely with future data projections, ensuring that the model remains effective even as the underlying data evolves over time. The model’s efficacy is rigorously benchmarked against 13 comparative models, using metrics such as MAE [8], Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) [9], and the coefficient of determination (R2) [10]. The empirical findings underscore CIMA- AttGRU’s superiority in prediction accuracy. These results highlight its effectiveness in accurately capturing the complex dynamics of the edamame futures market. For market stakeholders, the CIMA-AttGRU model presents a more robust tool for navigating market volatility, enabling more precise risk management, and facilitating informed decision- making. The principal contributions of this study are manifold: Time series forecasting, a critical component across various domains such as meteorology, finance, energy, and healthcare, has seen significant advancements with the adoption of deep learning, probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning. The Transformer architecture, initially designed for natural language processing, has been adapted to capture long-range dependencies in time series data [11], with studies exploring its effectiveness and efficiency [12, 13]. Probabilistic models like Bayesian time series and Gaussian Processes offer insights into the uncertainty of future observations, with recent innovations integrating deep learning to enhance forecasting capabilities [14]. The exploration of reinforcement learning for dynamic model adjustment [15] and meta-learning for few-shot learning scenarios [16] represent novel directions aiming at adaptability and generalization. Hybrid models combine traditional statistical methods with machine learning to capture both linear and non-linear patterns, demonstrating the synergy between ARIMA and neural networks, as well as the potential of deep learning architectures in ensemble models for improved accuracy [17]. Specific domain applications highlight the impact of advanced forecasting models in finance for predicting market trends [18], in energy for renewable energy management and load forecasting [19], and in healthcare for predicting disease outbreaks and patient admissions [20]. This evolving field continues to explore the intersection of diverse methodologies, reflecting the complex nature of time series data and the need for innovative forecasting models. Transitioning to a different approach, Yao et al.’s investigation into egg price forecasting using AutoRegressive (AR) models offers a contrasting perspective [21]. Yao et al.’s research highlights the significant influence of external factors, such as market policies and environmental changes, on futures prices. This finding underscores the necessity of considering such variables in predictive analyses to capture the full spectrum of influences affecting commodity prices. The application of RNNs in processing time series data, as demonstrated in Huang and Yu’s stock index predictions, has shown significant ad- vantages due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies. However, RNNs face challenges like the ‘vanishing gradient’ and ‘exploding gradient’ problems, which impede their effectiveness, especially with long-term data dependencies. Addressing these issues, Ouyang et al. proposed the Short-term Time Series Network (LSTNet), which effectively circumvents these limitations and outperforms both ARIMA and traditional RNNs models in agricultural product futures price prediction [22]. Wang and Gao’s research further asserts the superiority of LSTM models in time series pre- diction, despite challenges in training stability. Similarly, Huang and Yong successfully used Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) alongside LSTM for crude oil price prediction, emphasizing the critical role of optimal hyperparameter tuning [23]. Amalia et al. compared LSTM and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) models in agricultural product price prediction, finding that GRUs offer advantages in terms of speed and accuracy [24]. Peng et al. introduced an innovative CNN-GRU-Attention combination model for water source quality forecasting. This model leverages the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), GRU, and Attention mechanisms, demonstrating its superiority over other techniques in capturing complex patterns [25]. Finally, Yang et al. combined GRU and Attention mechanisms for individual stock predictions, showcasing the efficacy of integrating these advanced models to improve predictive accuracy [26]. The advancement of machine learning models in the domain of financial market analysis has seen significant contributions from various baseline models, each offering unique insights into time series forecasting and domain adaptation. Notably, models like LSTM [27] and GRU [28] have been instrumental in capturing temporal dependencies in market trends, while SVR [29] has provided robust solutions for nonlinear pattern recognition in price fluctuations. Additionally, attention-based models such as AttGRU [30], alongside innovative architectures like RainDrop [31] and SimTSC [32], have enhanced model sensitivity to crucial time series features. The LB-SimTSC [33] and TodayNet [34] further exemplify the integration of domain adaptation strategies, improving model robust- ness across different market conditions. Complex models incorporating multiple attention mechanisms, such as Attention-GRU [35], Attention-LSTM [36], and Attention-AttGRU [37], represent the forefront of leveraging deep learning to understand and predict agricultural market dynamics effectively. These models collectively contribute to the foundation upon which our study builds, aiming to enhance predictive accuracy and adaptability in forecasting edamame futures prices. The evolution of deep neural networks (DNNs) has significantly impacted domain adaptation (DA), a process critical in applications such as cross-domain image classification and person re-identification. This process involves modifying models to perform accurately across varying domains. Tzeng et al. have advanced this field by integrating adaptation layers into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which facilitate the extraction of domain- invariant features, essential for models to perform consistently across different domains [38]. Furthering this development, Long et al. combined Joint Maximum Mean Discrepancy (JMMD) with CNNs, a method that reduces disparities between different domain distributions, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to generalize across domains [39]. Deng et al. introduced an innovative approach, Cluster Alignment with a Teacher (CAT), which marks a significant contribution to DA by aligning data clusters in a teacher-student model framework, enhancing the model’s adaptability to new domains [40]. Our research is inspired by the adversarial learning-based DA, particularly Ganin et al.’s Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN). DANN employs an adversarial approach to train models to be domain-agnostic, thereby improving their performance across different domains [41]. This concept was further expanded by Long et al., who developed conditional domain adversarial networks. These networks refine the adversarial approach by conditioning the training process on domain-specific information, leading to more effective domain adaptation [42]. The cornerstone of our research lies in the development and application of the CIMA- AttGRU model, a pioneering approach designed to address the intricate dynamics of agricultural market trends, particularly in the context of edamame futures prices. This innovation is primarily motivated by the unique challenges posed by agricultural production’s pronounced seasonality and cyclicity. Recognizing the critical influence of these factors on price volatility and trend predictability, we incorporated Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) as a strategic component of our model. EMD’s ability to decompose non-stationary and non-linear time series data into a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) enables the effective separation of underlying cyclical patterns from noise, thereby facilitating a more nuanced analysis of seasonal and cyclic components inherent in agricultural data. This methodological choice is underpinned by the agricultural sector’s inherent characteristics, where production cycles are significantly influenced by seasonal variations and external climatic conditions. By applying EMD, our model gains the capacity to dissect these complex datasets into simpler oscillatory modes, each representing distinct frequency bands. This decomposition allows for the isolation and examination of seasonal effects and cyclical trends, which are pivotal for understanding and forecasting the edamame futures market’s behavior. The integration of EMD within the CIMA-AttGRU framework significantly enhances the model’s predictive performance. It does so by providing a robust mechanism for capturing and analyzing the temporal dependencies and patterns that traditional models might overlook. Furthermore, this approach empowers our model to offer insightful forecasts that are critically informed by an in-depth understanding of the agricultural market’s seasonal and cyclical dynamics, setting a new benchmark for accuracy and reliability in financial market analysis. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a specialized subset of RNNs, is characterized by its modular neural architecture, which is specifically designed to enhance the efficiency of information processing. To provide a clearer understanding of this intricate architecture, the GRU model’s design and operational flow are depicted in Fig 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g001 The CIMA methodology [43], which is primarily utilized for decomposing historical data into its intrinsic modes, faces inherent challenges when integrating new data sets. CIMA, known for its effectiveness in breaking down complex data into simpler components, encounters difficulties as the introduction of new data can significantly alter the results of its decomposition process. This change necessitates reprocessing by the trained model to accommodate the new information and ensure accurate decomposition. A critical aspect of this reprocessing is the increase in the number of components that the model needs to analyze and interpret. Each new data set potentially introduces additional modes or variations, thereby increasing the complexity of the decomposition. This escalation in the number of components directly correlates with an increase in processing time. Such an increase is a significant concern in time-sensitive applications, where rapid analysis and decision-making based on the latest data are crucial. The challenge, therefore, lies in balancing the accuracy and thoroughness of the CIMA methodology with the need for efficiency and speed in processing and updating the model with new data inputs. To address these challenges and optimize training efficiency, the concept of Aggregate Binary Crossings (ABC) is introduced. This measure is calculated as per the following equation: (1) The function sgn(p) is defined as: (2) ABC essentially quantifies the frequency of sign changes within each component of the data, thus serving as an indicator of data fluctuation. This metric is particularly pertinent in the context of edamame futures data. As per the documented findings in previous research. An analysis of the ABC values reveals distinct frequency characteristics across different components which is showed in Table 1. For instance, IMF1, identified as a high-frequency component, exhibits an ABC exceeding 40%. Conversely, IMF2 through IMF3 are categorized as medium-frequency components with ABC values ranging between 10% and 40%. Components IMF4 to IMF10, classified as low-frequency, have ABCs below 10% [44]. The reconstruction of these components is depicted in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g002 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.t001 This approach of using ABC for component analysis not only enhances the efficiency of the CIMA methodology in processing time series data but also provides a nuanced understanding of the data’s fluctuation characteristics, crucial for accurate forecasting in financial markets like edamame futures. The Attention Gate Unit (AttGRU) architecture depicted in Fig 3 represents a significant advancement in neural network design, particularly in how it computes candidate hidden states. This modification enables the AttGRU to process sequential data with enhanced capabilities, as it integrates an Attention mechanism that selectively focuses on specific parts of the input sequence. This allows the model to capture dependencies and nuances that might be overlooked by traditional GRU frameworks. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g003 In the advanced architecture of the Attention-based Gated Recurrent Unit (AttGRU), the dynamic interaction between the memory cell and input values plays a pivotal role. This sophisticated mechanism is articulated through two primary gates which integrate the output value from the preceding timestep, ms−1, and the contemporaneous input, ys, orchestrating the degree to which previous cognitive states are retained or discarded. This process is mathematically encapsulated as follows: (3) In this formulation, σ and φ denote the Sigmoid and Leaky ReLU activation functions, respectively. The dual-stage nature of this gate, involving and their corresponding bias terms . The algorithm for the synthetic update gate is represented as: (4) Here, the dual-stage mechanism of the update gate, employing matrices ˘ and biases , echoes the approach of the reset gate, ensuring a delicate balance between preservation and evolution of the memory state. AttGRU is formulated as: (5) In this expression, Vβ represents the weight matrix associated with the attention mechanism. The attention probabilities, Ps, are derived through the softmax function applied to the scale βs: (6) The final phase of the AttGRU’s operation involves the calculation of the candidate hidden state. The resulting combination is then weighted and summed, with the attention probability distribution, Ps, playing a crucial role. The output gate of AttGRU is delineated as follows: (7) This advanced framework, characterized by its dual-stage gates and attention-driven dynamics, embodies a significant stride in the evolution of recurrent neural network architectures, offering enhanced capabilities for processing sequential data with refined contextual awareness. In this study, we outline the comprehensive architecture of the CIMA-AttGRU model, as illustrated in Fig 4. Our research specifically focuses on analyzing edamame futures price data, a choice driven by the significant economic impact and market volatility associated with this commodity. The CIMA-AttGRU model, designed to handle the complexities of this data, is methodically segmented into six distinct components to optimize its analytical efficacy. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g004 The inaugural segment of our model is the input layer, where we introduce the primary dataset—edamame futures prices. This layer is crucial as it sets the foundation for the model’s data processing. In addition to the primary focus, we incorporate key financial indices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) (Fig 5), SP 500 (Fig 6), and NASDAQ (Fig 7).

Their inclusion in the input layer allows the model to contextualize the edamame price data within a broader economic landscape, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of our analysis. Fig 4 visually presents the CIMA-AttGRU model’s architecture, showcasing how each component, from the input layer to the final output, contributes to the processing and analysis of the data. This visualization is instrumental in understanding the intricate workings of the model and how it integrates various elements to provide a comprehensive analysis of edamame futures prices. The CIMA-AttGRU model’s architecture, as delineated in our study, consists of several layers, each meticulously designed to contribute to the model’s overall predictive analysis. The second tier, the data preprocessing layer, is where the raw input data is refined and prepared for analysis. This includes normalization, handling missing values, and selecting relevant features, all of which are essential for enhancing the accuracy of the predictions. The third layer is dedicated to CIMA decomposition, where the data is broken down into IMFs. These IMFs represent different frequency components in the data, and their separation is crucial for isolating distinct patterns and trends. In this phase, the AttGRU mechanism is employed to forecast each component independently, allowing for a nuanced analysis of the various elements within the dataset. Following this, the fifth layer–the combination layer–plays a vital role in bringing together the individual forecasts from each IMF. This consolidation is key to synthesizing the data into a unified analysis, ensuring that all relevant information is factored into the final prediction. The process culminates in the output layer, the final stage of the model. Here, the aggregated results from the previous layers are scaled to produce the final predictive output. This output embodies the comprehensive prediction derived from the intricate processes of the CIMA-AttGRU model, offering a well-rounded analysis based on the data. In time series analysis, there is a challenge of data migration which is a common occurrence in futures markets where changes over time can lead to domain shifts. To address this, we introduce the CADA algorithm. Within the framework of Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) training, initially conceptualized by Ganin and Lempitsky, a pivotal element is the incorporation of the marginal adversarial loss LT [41]. This loss function plays a crucial role in enabling the extraction of domain-invariant feature representations from both the source and target domains. It achieves this through adversarial learning, a process where the model is trained to minimize domain discrepancies, effectively harmonizing the marginal distributions of these domains. However, the conventional DANN model primarily focuses on aligning these domains at the level of their marginal distributions. While this approach has its merits, it can overlook the discriminative structures within the feature space. Such oversight may lead to negative transfer phenomena, where the model inadvertently adopts irrelevant or misleading features from the source domain. Our research draws upon established matrix optimization-based domain adaptation (DA) techniques to form the foundation of our proposed method. This approach is centered around the estimation of conditional distribution divergences. Specifically, it involves a detailed analysis of the variances in class conditional distributions. The subsequent sections will delve into a more comprehensive discussion on how these estimations are carried out and the implications thereof for the field of domain adaptation. In the realm of domain adaptation (DA) strategies for DNNs, which are steered by matrix optimization, the task of accurately estimating the equation outlined in Eq 9 is a formidable challenge. This equation integrates both genuine and synthetic labels, and its precise estimation is often complicated by the complexities inherent in batch sampling. These complexities chiefly stem from a potential misalignment between instances in the source and target domains. Such misalignment can skew the accuracy of estimating class-conditional distributions. Addressing this challenge, our approach introduces a selective mechanism for class subset sampling. This mechanism operates on a principle of alignment congruence; it calculates distribution distances only in instances where there is a match in label spaces between source and target domains during batch sampling. This strategic sampling approach is essential in accurately computing the loss function, which is a critical component of dependent adversarial domain adaptation. It significantly contributes to the model’s robustness and enhances its performance across varied and intricate data environments. The proposed framework, as articulated in Eq 9, involves a nuanced understanding of data instances, denoted as ZU/S,F, representing the Fth class from either source or target domain. Additionally, OF symbolizes the discriminator assigned to the Fth class. A notable aspect of this framework is the incorporation of pseudo labels from the target domain in each iteration, an approach that significantly augments the model’s precision and adaptability. To address the predictive loss aspect, we introduce a loss function specifically designed for evaluating the accuracy of time series forecasts in agricultural market trends. The predictive loss LP is formulated as follows: (10) where N is the number of forecasted points, yi represents the actual value at time i, and denotes the forecasted value. This loss function, rooted in the MSE, quantifies the deviation of the model’s predictions from the actual market outcomes, thereby guiding the optimization process towards more accurate forecasts. Incorporating LP into our domain adaptation framework, the overall objective be- comes the minimization of both domain adaptation loss and predictive loss. This dual- objective approach ensures that our model not only learns domain-invariant features but also hones its forecasting accuracy, making it particularly well-suited for predicting agricultural market trends with high precision and reliability. In conclusion, our CADA method extends the conventional DANN framework by incorporating a predictive loss component. This integration enhances the model’s capability to adapt across domains while simultaneously improving its forecasting accuracy, offering a robust solution for domain adaptation challenges in the context of agricultural market trend forecasting. The study was conducted using a computational setup comprised of a Windows 10 operating system. The hardware included an Intel(R) Core (TM) i7 CPU, an NVIDIA GTX4090 graphics card, and 24.00 GB of RAM. For software, Python 3.9 served as the programming language, with PyCharm utilized as the development environment. Data for this analysis was sourced from the Tushare platform, an open-access repository for financial big data. The study focused on key financial indices, U.S. Dollar Index (USDX), and NASDAQ. To assess the interrelations among these indices, the Maximum Information Coefficient (MaxIC) was employed in Table 2. This MaxIC is particularly adept at handling nonlinear data relationships. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.t002 For a pair of variables (A, B), the methodology involves partitioning them into p and q intervals along their respective axes, thereby creating a grid of pq cells. Given a dataset of these two-dimensional variables, the MaxIC is computed as follows: (11) In this formula, MaxICMaxIC(A,B) signifies the maximum information coefficient for the variables (A, B). The term MaxInfo*(Dataset,p,q) represents the maximum mutual information obtainable from the dataset for the given partitioning. The SampleSize denotes the total number of data points, with Func(SampleSize) being a function of this size, typically set to SampleSize0.6 [45]. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using a dataset encompassing the edamame futures trading activities on the Dalian Commodity Exchange. The dataset is comprised of a total of 2750 entries. These entries were strategically segmented into different subsets for the purpose of the experiment: 2200 entries were allocated for the training set, while 275 entries each were designated for the verification and test sets, respectively. This distribution was meticulously planned to ensure a robust and thorough evaluation of the dataset. The data used in this study was sourced from the Tushare platform, an open-access repository for financial big data. Our analysis focused on key financial indices, including the U.S. Dollar Index (USDX) and NASDAQ. These indices were selected due to their established impact on market trends and economic indicators, providing important context for understanding the dynamics of the edamame futures market. The primary dataset comprised edamame futures trading activities on the Dalian Commodity Exchange, totaling 2,750 data entries. The choice to focus on edamame futures was driven by the significant economic impact and high market price volatility associated with this commodity. To ensure a robust and comprehensive evaluation, we employed a carefully designed data segmentation strategy: 2,200 entries were allocated to the training set, while 275 entries each were designated for the validation and test sets. This approach allows for a thorough assessment of the dataset and enhances the reliability of the experimental results. By incorporating these key financial indices as external influences and focusing on the edamame futures price data, our study aims to contextualize the analysis within a broader economic landscape. This approach enhances the accuracy and relevance of our findings, providing valuable insights into the complex dynamics of the edamame futures market. The adopted methodology for data standardization is encapsulated by the following mathematical representation: (12) In this equation, Vt signifies the interpolated value at time t, while Vt−1 and Vt−2 represent the recorded data from the immediate and second preceding trading days at time t, respectively. Subsequent to this interpolation, a comprehensive integration of the influencing factors and the edamame futures data is conducted. Given the substantial variance often present in the magnitudes of different features within the dataset, there is a potential risk of inadequate learning by the algorithm. This approach normalizes the data, scaling the features to a uniform range of [0, 1], thereby enhancing algorithmic learning efficiency. The experimental design, as depicted in Fig 8, incorporates a step size of 1 and a sequence length of 7. With a total data length of 2750, the data is restructured into a three-dimensional format, yielding a final dimension of (2744, 7, 12). This reconfiguration involves grouping the data into segments of seven rows and eight columns, starting from x − 6 data points. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g008 The efficacy of neural networks in generalizing performance often surpasses that of linear models, attributed to their intricate parameter architecture. However, this complexity necessitates meticulous fine-tuning of numerous hyperparameters to achieve optimal generalization capabilities. In this experimental framework, an initial range for the optimal hyperparameters was established based on prior experiential knowledge. We conducted Bayesian optimization privately to search for optimal hyperparameters. However, we discovered that extreme hyperparameter optimization could lead to a reduction in the model’s generalization performance. While the chosen reasonable hyperparameter values based on experience may not yield the best results on our specific dataset, they help ensure that the models are less sensitive to parameter variations, promoting better generalization and ease of fine-tuning. Regarding the choice of 32 units in Table 3, this value was selected based on our prior experience and considering the trade-off between model complexity and computational efficiency. We acknowledge that exploring a wider range of unit values could potentially improve performance. However, our primary focus was on maintaining consistency across models to enable a fair comparison. We believe that the chosen hyperparameter values strike a balance between model performance and generalization ability. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.t003 In addition to the hyperparameter optimization techniques discussed earlier, we also incorporated early stopping criteria into our model training process to further enhance the model’s generalization ability and prevent overfitting. Early stopping is a widely used regularization technique in machine learning that involves monitoring the model’s performance on a validation set during training and stopping the training process when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade. To implement early stopping, we split our data into training, validation, and test sets. During the training process, we monitored the model’s performance on the validation set at each epoch. If the model’s performance on the validation set did not improve for a specified number of epochs (defined as the patience parameter), the training was stopped, and the model weights from the best-performing epoch were retained. This approach allowed us to determine the optimal value for the patience parameter that maximized the model’s performance on the validation set while preventing overfitting. The incorporation of early stopping criteria into our model training process not only improved the model’s performance but also provided a more rigorous and comprehensive analysis of our approach. By leveraging this technique, we ensured that our proposed CIMA-AttGRU model is robust, reliable, and capable of generalizing well to unseen data. The performance of these models was rigorously evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R2, seen in Fig 9. The results, detailed in Table 4, were derived using the test dataset. These results highlighted that the conventional regression model SVR exhibited the least predictive accuracy. Within the realm of deep learning models, AttGRU demonstrated superior performance over Attention-GRU, with CIMA-AttGRU emerging as the most effective predictive model. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g009 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.t004 A comparative analysis, as evidenced in Table 4, reveals that the AttGRU model achieved a significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the standard GRU model. This improvement is quantified by a reduction in MAE by 7.47, a decrease in RMSE by 8.72. Similarly, when comparing the CIMA-enhanced models, CIMA-AttGRU outperformed CIMA-Attention-GRU, evidenced by a reduction in MAE by 7.41, a decrease in RMSE by 8.10. The comparative visualization of predicted versus actual values for GRU, Attention- GRU, Attention-NGU, AttGRU, CIMA-Attention-GRU, and CIMA-AttGRU models is provided in Fig 10. This graphical representation underscores the enhanced predictive capabilities of the CIMA-AttGRU model over its counterparts. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g010 To assess the individual contributions of the CIMA and AttGRU components to the forecasting performance of the CIMA-AttGRU model, we designed a series of ablation experiments depicted in Fig 11. These experiments were structured to incrementally remove key components from the full model and evaluate the resulting impact on prediction accuracy. The experiments were conducted on a dataset comprising edamame futures prices, with the following configurations for model evaluation: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g011 The outcomes of the ablation study are summarized in Table 4, highlighting the performance metrics across different model configurations. The ablation study reveals the critical role played by both CIMA and AttGRU in enhancing the forecasting performance of the model. While the base GRU model provides a baseline for comparison, the addition of CIMA preprocessing significantly reduces both MAE and RMSE, indicating the importance of noise reduction and signal decomposition in improving prediction accuracy. The incorporation of the attention mechanism via AttGRU layers further improves the model’s ability to capture temporal dependencies, as evidenced by the reduced error metrics. The full CIMA-AttGRU model, combining both CIMA preprocessing and AttGRU, achieves the best performance across all metrics. This underscores the synergy between CIMA’s ability to prepare the data through signal decomposition and the AttGRU’s capabiity to focus on relevant temporal features, leading to more accurate predictions of edamame futures prices. To rigorously evaluate the predictive performance of the CIMA-AttGRU model relative to other models, we employed the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test [46] to compare the statistical significance of differences in prediction accuracy. The DM test is a widely used non-parametric statistical test for comparing the forecast errors of two models. The null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference in the predictive accuracy of the two models. If the p-value is less than the significance level (e.g., 0.05), the null hypothesis can be rejected, indicating a significant difference in the models’ performance. We selected six main benchmark models (SVR, LSTM, GRU, Attention-LSTM, Attention-GRU, AttGRU, Attention-AttGRU, and CIMA-Attention-GRU) and conducted pairwise comparisons with the CIMA-AttGRU model. The test results are presented in Table 5. As shown, the CIMA-AttGRU model demonstrates statistically significant differences in predictive accuracy compared to all other models (p < 0.05). The absolute values of the DM statistics and the magnitude of the p-values are consistent with the performance metrics in Table 4, indicating that models with larger performance gaps have larger absolute DM statistics and smaller corresponding p-values. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.t005 The DM test results provide strong evidence supporting the superior performance of the CIMA-AttGRU model in the task of soybean futures price prediction. The integration of CIMA decomposition and attention mechanism enables the model to better capture the intrinsic patterns in the data and enhance the accuracy of predictions. These findings are consistent with the experimental results presented throughout the paper, reinforcing the effectiveness of the proposed model. The statistical significance tests add robustness to our claims about the CIMA-AttGRU model’s performance and strengthen the overall credibility of the research. By demonstrating the model’s statistically significant improvements over a range of benchmark models, we provide compelling evidence for its practical value in forecasting soybean futures prices. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the CIMA-AttGRU model in predicting soybean futures prices compared to other benchmark models. This can be attributed to its unique architecture, which combines CIMA for noise reduction and AttGRU for capturing dynamic temporal dependencies. CIMA enables the model to filter out market noise and decompose the time series data into intrinsic modes, addressing the high volatility in agricultural markets. This allows the model to focus on essential features and underlying patterns, leading to improved prediction accuracy. The AttGRU component, with its attention mechanism, dynamically adjusts to temporal dependencies, enabling the model to capture nuanced fluctuations in futures prices often overlooked by traditional models. The attention mechanism helps prioritize relevant information and adapt to changing market conditions. The incorporation of CADA enhances the model’s robustness by addressing domain adaptivity, which is crucial for soybean futures, where price determinants vary significantly over time and across regions. CADA aligns feature distributions between source and target domains, improving generalization ability and adaptability to new market conditions. The ablation study highlights the individual contributions of CIMA and AttGRU components to the overall performance, showing their crucial roles in improving prediction accuracy. While CIMA-AttGRU demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy, its increased complexity may lead to longer training times and higher computational requirements. Future research could explore ways to optimize the model’s architecture and training process to improve efficiency without compromising predictive performance. In this study, we propose the CIMA-AttGRU model for predicting soybean futures prices. The model combines CIMA for noise reduction and AttGRU for capturing temporal dependencies, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark models. The experimental results, supported by statistical tests, demonstrate the effectiveness of CIMA-AttGRU in capturing the complex dynamics of the soybean futures market and providing accurate predictions. The model’s ability to filter out noise, focus on relevant features, and adapt to changing market conditions makes it valuable for stakeholders in the soybean industry. The proposed architecture can be adapted to other agricultural commodities and financial markets, where accurate forecasting is crucial. Future research directions include incorporating additional external factors and exploring the integration of CIMA-AttGRU with other machine learning techniques to improve its generalization ability and adaptability. In conclusion, CIMA-AttGRU represents a significant advancement in agricultural market forecasting, providing a powerful tool for predicting soybean futures prices. Its superior performance, robustness, and adaptability contribute to the growing body of research on the application of advanced machine learning techniques in the financial and agricultural sectors.

Intel (INTC-5.26%) announced Monday that chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger is retiring from the company and has stepped down from its board of directors. The move comes as the chipmaker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors like Nvidia (NVDA-0.04%) amid the artificial intelligence boom. In recent months, Intel has also been the subject of activist investor interest — including a potential takeover bid — as its performance continues to lag. As the board searches for a new chief, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant named David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-CEOs. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board and its interim executive chair, said the pair will continue the company’s mission to simplify and strengthen Intel’s product portfolio and advance manufacturing and foundry capabilities while cutting costs. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,” Yeary said. Intel stock was up about 4% in pre-market trading on Monday. The company’s shares have shed roughly 50% of their value so far this year. Gelsinger returned to Intel as CEO in 2021, replacing Bob Swan, to help modernize — and stabilize — the company, to little avail. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,” Gelsinger said in a statement Monday. The company has taken several measures to kickstart its sputtering performance. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. That included reducing its headcount by roughly 15,000, or 15% of its workforce. Gelsinger said at the time that these were the “most consequential changes” in the company’s history. As part of the restructuring plan, Intel took a $2.8 billion charge in the third quarter. The company saw a 6% year-over-year decline in revenues in the three months ended Sept. 28, for a net loss of $16.99 billion, or $3.88 per share. Intel also reportedly hired Morgan Stanley and other advisors to help fend off potential activist investors, according to CNBC (CMCSA+0.61%). Early last month, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises 30 leading U.S. stocks, to make room for Nvidia as the index shifts toward AI pioneers.

Billionaire Jeff Bezos is throwing his weight behind a computing company that’s coming for Nvidia’s (NVDA-0.04%) dominance of the artificial intelligence chip market. Bezos Expeditions, the Amazon (AMZN+1.11%) founder’s private investment vehicle, was part of a $693 million funding round for Tenstorrent, the company announced Monday. He joined LG Electronics and Fidelity in the round led by South Korean firms Samsung Securities and AFW Partners. “We are excited by the breadth of investors that believe in our vision,” Keith Witek, the chief operating officer of Tenstorrent, in a statement. “If you look at this group, you see a balance of financial investors and strategic investors, as well as some notable individuals that have conviction in our plans for AI.” Tenstorrent said it will use the money to “build out open-source AI software stacks, hire developers, expand its global development and design centers, and build systems and clouds for AI developers.” The company has strived to provide more accessible and affordable solutions for companies looking to develop their AI capabilities, putting itself in direct competition with fellow Santa Clara, California-based firm Nvidia. So far, it has signed about $150 million in contracts, Tenstorrent said. Currently the second-most valuable company in the world behind Apple (AAPL0.00%), Nvidia is a Wall Street powerhouse and a behemoth in the AI chip space. Last month, it reported $35.1 billion in revenues for its fiscal third quarter, with 36% of that revenue — or $12.6 billion — coming from only three unnamed customers. Those sales are primarily attributable to Nvidia’s Compute & Networking segment, according to filing. Although Nvidia will not disclose the customers, its top buyers are likely to include Google (GOOGL-1.02%) parent Alphabet, Meta (META-0.82%), Microsoft (MSFT+1.22%), and Tesla (TSLA+3.17%) — all of whom are major players in the AI boom. But smaller companies are struggling to build up their AI capabilities as Big Tech firms corner the market — and power-hungry AI chips remain prohibitively expensive. That’s where Tenstorrent is hoping to come in. Founder and CEO Jim Keller told Bloomberg that Tenstorrent uses open-source and commonplace technology to provide engineering solutions that put AI in reach for more firms, and skips costly and complex parts, including like high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used by Nvidia. “You can’t beat Nvidia if you use HBM, because Nvidia buys the most HBM and has a cost advantage,” Keller said. “But they’ll never be able to bring the price down the way HBM is built into their products and their sockets.” Open-source technology has become increasingly popular amid the AI boom, given its cost effectiveness. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the company’s first open-source, multimodal large language model, Llama 3.2, will be the way forward. “It’s sort of like the Linux of AI, and we’re seeing closed-source labs react by trying to slash their prices to compete with Llama,” he said at Meta’s annual Connect conference in September. Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI also made its chatbot, Grok-1, an open-source model. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he’s willing to work with President-elect Donald Trump to dismantle government regulations that hinder economic growth. The U.S. imposes “excessive permitting and regulation,” Bezos said, speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit in New York City on Wednesday. “We need a growth orientation in this country.” The day after … The Amazon founder said that he is working on a plan to turn around the Post: "We saved the Washington Post once, this will be the second time." Trump's plan to slash the corporate income tax rate for domestic manufacturers would fuel a multitrillion investment while he's in office. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are two of the most popular stocks among retail investors, but the billionaires listed below bought one and sold the other in the third quarter. Cliff Asness at AQR Capital Management purchased 719,710 shares of Nvidia, increasing his stake by 5%. Nvidia is now the largest holding in the portfolio, and Apple is the second largest. Nvidia topped analyst estimates across all metrics on its third quarter earnings call. $83 billion has just been sitting there underground this whole time. Nvidia continues to be the runaway leader in chips used for artificial intelligence (AI). The company's leading position in the data center market has driven triple-digit revenue growth over the last few years. Nvidia is now one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a $3.4 trillion market cap at present. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks That Can Do Well in December.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) stands against the other stocks that can do well in December according to Jim Cramer. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently […] A falling-interest-rate environment is generally a positive catalyst for the stock market. Having said that, there are some areas of the stock market that tend to benefit from falling rates more than others. One in particular is real estate, and it could be a great time to shop for top-notch real estate stocks while the Federal Reserve is still in the early stages of its rate-cutting cycle. Advanced Micro Devices could disrupt Nvidia's dominance in the market for data center chips. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is proving to be a game-changing technology and with it, several companies are emerging as winners in this sector of the economy. The stocks for many of these companies have already seen large gains. Let's look at five AI stocks that could be set to continue to run higher in the coming years. The chipmaker is considering at least two people outside the company to replace former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who abruptly retired on Sunday.

Finding companies that pay dividends monthly can also help with your budgeting based on the timing of your bills (e.g., monthly rent or mortgage payments, utility bills, etc.). Real estate investment trusts (REITs) can be a fertile source for finding qualifying stocks that pay monthly dividends. As global markets continue to reach record highs, buoyed by positive economic indicators and geopolitical developments, investors are increasingly seeking stable income sources amid fluctuating policy landscapes. In this context, dividend stocks offer an attractive opportunity for those looking to capitalize on steady returns, particularly in a market environment where traditional growth avenues may face uncertainties. A change in presidential economic policy generates curiosity and concern about the direction and flow of interest rates or which economic sectors could flourish under the upcoming administration....

Investing $5,000 can be a good amount to put into a growth stock because it can lead to significant long-term gains. Three stocks that I think could be good growth stocks if you have $5,000 to invest today are Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), and Carnival Corp. (NYSE: CCL). Here's why these can be ideal options for growth investors, particularly if you're looking for good value buys, as well. Now, Intel needs to focus on efficiency, the company's chief global operations officer said on Wednesday. Everyone knows Warren Buffett is famous for being frugal. This is the billionaire who still lives in the same house he bought in Omaha in 1958 for $31,500 and is perfectly content eating McDonald's breakfast most mornings. But what's it like to be on the receiving end of his gift-giving? Turns out, it's a mix of practical, surprising and downright hilarious. Don't Miss: Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you. Inspired by Uber and The problem with amazing growth stocks is that when the market discovers them, enthusiastic investors can often converge on them quickly, sending the price through the roof. Instead, it creates unnecessary volatility and a stock price that can undermine an otherwise healthy investment thesis. Prices need to be tied to some intrinsic value measure to make sense. Intel on Thursday named two chip industry veterans to its board, as the struggling semiconductor firm looks for a new top boss following the recent ouster of Pat Gelsinger and tries to reclaim its lost glory. The chipmaker said Eric Meurice, former CEO of chipmaking equipment provider ASML, and Steve Sanghi, interim CEO of Microchip Technology, are the new additions to its board. Ken Griffin's Citadel Advisors just increased its stake in a very successful S&P 500-themed ETF. New York City Mayor Eric Adams is seizing the moment as Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) value edges closer to the $100,000 mark, up 129% this year. At a press conference on Tuesday, Adams had a pointed message for his skeptics: "Remember y'all laughed at me when I first got my Bitcoin? Who's laughing now?" Adams, who took his first three paychecks in Bitcoin and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) upon assuming office in January 2022, faced ridicule at the time.

Many of them made their decision based on the belief that he would strengthen the economy. However, many... Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) both are playing key roles in one of today's hottest growth areas: artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia sells graphics processing units (GPUs) that power critical tasks such as the training and inferencing of models, along with many other related products and services. Supermicro is a behind-the-scenes player, integrating these and other top AI chips into its servers and workstations for data centers. Amidst a backdrop of record highs in major U.S. indices and geopolitical developments influencing market sentiment, investors are increasingly seeking stability through reliable dividend stocks. With the S&P 500 marking its longest winning streak in over two months, finding stocks that offer consistent income can be an effective strategy to navigate current economic uncertainties and capitalize on robust market performance. Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ) stock gained a lot of attention recently after it was added to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio of stock holdings. While investors love to follow Warren Buffett's moves, it likely wasn't his stock pick given the relatively small size of the purchase. Instead, it was likely bought by one of Berkshire's two other investment managers, Ted Weschler or Todd Combs. We break down what you need to earn to afford a $400,000 home in the United States.

This high-flying stock could keep soaring in 2025 following tremendous gains this year. Nvidia may be looking to buy other companies to expand its capabilities. In a recent conference, its CFO specifically mentioned the prospects for growth through mergers and acquisitions. Ford, along with some other automakers, has a bit of a creepy history with wanting to track people’s every movement. That strange saga continues with news of the Blue Oval filing a patent for a tracking system that works even if someone disables tracking on the vehicle.

It's been an extremely challenging few years for Boeing (NYSE: BA), and its recovery under new CEO Kelly Ortberg isn't going to be a quick fix. The backlog is there, and Boeing continues to win orders, so what can investors expect from Boeing in 2025? It's no secret that incomes tend to drop during retirement. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, people 65 or older had a median income of $50,290 in 2023. By contrast, the real median... The company is still suffering from the significant drop in sales of its coronavirus products and the less-than-impressive financial results it has produced during the past two years. Pfizer has, unquestionably, made progress. Many new approvals and acquisitions have expanded its lineup and pipeline. Palo Alto, California-based Broadcom is among the biggest beneficiaries of hefty demand for AI-supporting hardware, as so-called hyperscalers turn to its custom chips to diversify their supply chains beyond Nvidia's costly processors. The technology, called 3.5D XDSiP, will allow Broadcom's custom-chip customers to boost the amount of memory inside each packaged chip and speed up its performance by directly connecting critical components. There are five products in development that use the new tech, with production shipments starting in February 2026, Broadcom said. One of the largest hacks in U.S. history has prompted more warnings about how to protect yourself from hackers, fraudsters and criminals. US president Joe Biden made a mistake in not embracing Elon Musk, his predecessor Bill Clinton has said, after the Tesla boss donated millions to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Americans have abandoned 29.2 million 401(k) accounts holding trillions in assets. You can find them using a new government database or calling past employers. Brian Thompson was a little-known health insurance lifer before this week. Huawei's supply chain team is working overtime to meet demand for its new Mate 70 smartphones as supplies they had initially prepared were insufficient, an executive told the state-owned Securities Times newspaper on Thursday. He Gang, Huawei's consumer business group CEO, said reservations for the phone, which do not require customers to put down a deposit, had exceeded 6.7 million so far and described demand for it as "excessive". Huawei launched the Mate 70 phone last week as a successor to the Mate 60, which made a big splash in 2023 by revealing that Huawei was able to overcome years of U.S. sanctions and locally make an advanced chip. The S&P 500 has hit record levels this year and many stocks have generated fantastic returns for investors. Among the S&P 500's worst performers thus far in 2024 are Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).

Among the most popular tech products of 2024, the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been the surprise hit. Amazon is offering the version with the classic black frames for $239 (20% off the $299 retail price). This is an especially excellent deal when you consider that many styles of the Meta Ray-Bans were often out of stock for much of the first half of 2024 -- and the smart glasses have rarely been discounted. A lot of the appeal is the fact that they look just like normal Ray-Bans, and you can even replace the lenses with your own glasses prescription. Also: The best Cyber Monday deals: Live updates The caveat to keep in mind here is that Amazon sells eight different styles of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's the classic black frames with green tinted lenses that are on sale for the lowest price. Other styles cost $30 to $80 more. For example, if you want to wear these smart glasses both inside and outside, then you can get a pair with transition lenses. Those normally retail for $379, but Amazon is offering them 20% off, for $303. I tried the Meta Ray-Bans earlier this year and was much more impressed than I expected. First, to be clear, they are augmented reality glasses, but they're audio-only, so there's no screen overlaid on the lenses. All the feedback comes through the speakers that down-fire into your ears and are hidden in the arms of the glasses. Also: Why Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses are my favorite tech purchase this year I was also pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. For phone calls and conference calls and for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, the sound is nearly as bright and clear as a pair of AirPods or other quality earbuds. For listening to music, movies, or shows with lots of bass and surround sound effects, the Meta Ray-Bans are acceptable but not nearly as robust as a pair of high-end headphones from Apple, Sony, Bose, and others. And because of the open concept, naturally the Meta Ray-Bans can't offer the kind of noise cancellation that you get from AirPods Pro or the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds, for example. All in all, the sound of the Meta Ray-Bans is similar to what you get from the AirPods Pro in transparency mode. But, the Meta Ray-Bans can also do things that no headphones can do. They have a built-in 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for taking photos and capturing videos. This camera is about the same quality as an iPhone 12 or a Samsung Galaxy S20. It only takes photos and videos in portrait mode, but it's far faster to tap the button on top of the right arm of the glasses than it is to pull your camera out of your pocket. The Meta Ray-Bans also have a built-in AI assistant that you can trigger by saying "Hey Meta," and use the large language models that Meta has been furiously building over the past several years. For basic information searches, it works well and is another nice option for leaving your phone in your pocket. The battery life is about a half-day with moderate use, but you can quickly charge to about 50% with 20 minutes in the included case. The case itself charges via standard USB-C, which is nice. You can nearly double the battery by turning off the "Hey Meta" listening feature -- which I did. Meta also regularly rolls out software updates that bring new functionality to the Meta Ray-Bans. For example, during 2024 the Meta Ray-Bans added the capability of translating from Spanish to English in real time and the ability to do a visual search to identify landmarks or translate street signs. And Meta says it will continue to add new features such as helping you remember things you've seen, like your parking spot. Also: The best Apple deals for Cyber Monday 2024 If you're concerned about the way Meta handles privacy -- as many of us are -- the good thing about the Meta Ray-Bans is that they don't require a Facebook account. While they do require a Meta account, you can at least ostensibly keep them separate from your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp data. That makes it easier for me to recommend the product from a privacy perspective. Don't get me wrong, the AirPods Pro 2 are available for a great deal at $153 ($97 off) for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But the Meta Ray-Bans can do nearly all that the AirPods Pro can do and more. And since smart glasses are getting more and more common and the promise of smarter AI-powered features are on the horizon, getting a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses gives you a better chance of getting a taste of the future.

Me encontré un enlace oficial y actualizado a la lista de dominios de primer nivel de la IANA (la Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, que se encarga de estas cosas). Allí se indican esos dominios «extra» que se inventaron además de los de los países (.es, .pt, .ft, etcétera) y los genéricos de toda la vida (.com, .net, etcétera), lo que hizo que empezaran a aparecer otros nuevos y originales con denominaciones interesantes, además de –ya puestos– las marcas comerciales. Tal vez nunca te hayas topado con uno o no te hayas fijado por dónde navegabas: funcionan exactamente igual que los normales y también se les pueden asignar direcciones de correo como a los de toda la vida. Echarle un vistazo es realmente interesante, porque los hay a cual más curioso: Para empezar, hay muchos que empiezan por XN-- que se corresponden con palabras que incluyen caracteres especiales: la ñ, o de idiomas como el árabe o el hindi. Ese código se conoce como Punycode y proviene del RFC3492, que convierte Unicode a caracteres válidos en esos dominios. Luego están otros como .gal y .eus para Galicia y Euskadi, pero no en cambio otros que se solicitaron en su día como .telefonica o .terra (d.e.p.) En cambio .zara, que se pidió en esa época (2010s) sí que está. Se decía que esos dominios costaban más de 25.000 dólares al año y unos 185.000 cuando se solicitaban por primera vez. ¿Qué otras marcas están por ahí presentes? Alibaba, Airtel, AmericanExpress, Apple, Barcalys, Bloomberg, Cisco, Epson, Ericsson, Ferrari, Ferrero, Gallo, Google, IBM, LaCaixa, Lamborghini, Jaguar, Mango, Omega, Panasonic, Philips, Yahoo, Walmart, Windows y Zara… así a simple vista. También hay genéricos como .adult, .business, .date, .earth, .energy, .global, .holiday, .map, .movie, .security o .viajes (el único que he visto en español). El hecho de que sitios como Iberia.viajes no lleven a Iberia ya dice mucho de lo que se puede esperar de algunos de estos dominios, para sorpresa de nadie.

We recently compiled a list of the 9 Trending AI Stocks On Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks. xAI founder Elon Musk has raised billions in funding for his AI startup in the past few months. Recent comments from the eccentric billionaire suggest that he is planning to launch an AI-powered gaming studio through xAI that will rival the game studios that are owned by massive corporations. He made the remarks in a post on social networking platform X. The startup has ballooned in valuation over the past few years. The Grok developer recently raised $5 billion in new funding, bringing the valuation of the startup to $50 billion, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Just like xAI, other AI startups are also turning heads in the venture capital world. For example, tech news platform TechCrunch reports that Pathway, an AI startup, just raised a $10 million Seed round to build live AI systems that, the company claims, think and learn in real-time as humans do. Per the report, the Pathway offering includes what it calls infrastructure components that power live AI systems, feeding on structured and unstructured data, meaning that enterprise AI platforms can make decisions on up-to-date knowledge. Customers so far include NATO and the French post office, the report adds. READ ALSO: 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

Latest reports, published by tech news platform TechRadar, contend that the chipmaker will reveal the RTX 5090 cards at the CES 2025 show in January. Per the report, the AI-capable RTX 5090 cards would be a GPU targeted at professionals, rather than PC gamers, to justify a possible price hike. The RTX 5090 will reportedly feature a 22.2% increase in die size over the RTX 4090, which translates to better performance but a heftier price tag. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: These 5 ‘Special’ Dividends Are More Than One-Hit Wonders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/12/02/these-5-special-dividends-are-more-than-one-hit-wonders/

Piggy bank with business stuff, business and finance concept, vintage color tone. Today we’ll discuss a 5.4% dividend that actually annualizes to 7%. A 5.7% payer that really dishes 12.4%. And even a headline 15% yield that is understated because the company handed out 16.1% last year. Wait. What? These “typos” fool the mainstream financial websites. We are discussing special dividends today. Payouts that are awarded as a bonus to regular quarterly dividends. Only a select few firms dish specials. Sometimes, it’s thanks to a sudden influx of money. Let’s take billboard and transit display giant Outfront Media (OUT) which sold its Canadian business for C$410 million in cash in June. Fast forward to November, and Outfront announced a massive 75-cent special dividend on top of its 30-cent quarterly dividend, vaulting its 12-month yield from a healthy 6.3% to a mouth-watering 10.2%. This, of course, was a one-off special—not one that we are looking to bank on annually. We want “the other” type of special payer. The company that says it’s a one-off, but makes the payment every single year. These tend to fall into one of two camps: These are the stocks that can pay us more specials in the future. Their current yields are often understated today, because specials don’t count in the annual yield calculations. Today we’ll review five generous special payers. Mainstream financial websites list their yields between 5.4 and 15.0%. But they actually paid 7.0% to 16.1% over the past year. Let’s see if history is on pace to repeat or, at least, rhyme. Ford (F) Listed Dividend Yield: 5.4% Dividend Yield With Specials: 7.0% Ford (F) hardly needs an introduction—it’s an American automotive pioneer, and its F-Series has held the title of world’s best-selling truck for nearly a half-century. But Ford doesn’t necessarily have the world’s happiest shareholders. On a pure share-price basis, Ford—across a number of ups and downs—is effectively flat since 1994. That’s zero price returns—if anyone has held for two decades, their only gains as of right now have come from the dividend. That dividend, however, is mighty interesting. Ford temporarily suspended its dividend in 2020 as COVID reared its ugly head, then brought it back at 10 cents per share for a few quarters before returning it to the pre-pandemic 15-cent level. However, instead of just raising its regular past 15 cents, Ford has spent the past two Februarys announcing special dividends—first 63 cents in 2023, then a more modest 18 cents in 2024. That’s part of a stated plan to distribute 40%-50% of free cash flow every year—and if the regular doesn’t do the job, shareholders will get a supplemental payout. (Ford’s FCF in 2023 was $6.8 billion; it’s guiding for $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion this year, so we could assume a decently higher special in 2025 compared to 2024.) But we need more than a nice dividend. And on that front, it’s tough to be overly positive. Ford’s earnings are expected to decline by about 10% this year before leveling out in 2025. The company’s traditional, hybrid and fleet vehicles are generally doing well, though its electric-vehicle arm continues to struggle and deliver thick (albeit shrinking) losses. Meanwhile, while Ford should reach its expected $2 billion in cost cuts this year, warranty costs and inflation are still holding the automaker back. But F shares are cheap, at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of around 6.5, and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) of 0.65. (A stock with a PEG below 1.0 is considered undervalued.) Equinor (EQNR) Listed Dividend Yield: 5.7% Dividend Yield With Specials: 12.4% Equinor (EQNR) is little-known to most American investors, though it will occasionally pop up on the radar of anyone seeking out great yields in the energy patch. This Norwegian energy firm is actually two-thirds state-owned, has operations in roughly 30 countries (though most of its production comes from the Norwegian Continental Shelf), and produces roughly 2.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day. While it’s heavy in traditional oil and gas operations, Equinor has increasingly delved into renewables and low-carbon solutions, and has pledged to become a net-zero energy company by 2050. It owns a nearly 10% stake in Danish wind firm Orsted, and generated 677 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable power in its most recent quarter. Indeed, its focus on green energy—largely a product of Norway’s more ambitious energy targets—has hamstrung the firm compared to energy majors such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), which are still doggedly investing in traditional energy extraction. Equinor also has one of the most potent special dividends. Indeed, Equinor has paid out “ordinary” and “extraordinary” dividends over the past few years. Its past three specials have been equal to the 35-cent regular distribution, with the fourth coming out to 60 cents per share. All told, those extraordinary dividends have added a whopping 6.7 points to EQNR’s yield. That’s on top of what has been an uber-generous buyback program. But this is where diving into company reports comes in handy. Seeing as how Equinor isn’t exactly a first-to-mind energy stock to most Americans, there hasn’t been much (some, but not much) reporting on that extraordinary dividend floating away. But indeed, a bullet point in the company’s 2023 full-year report noted: “Expect to conclude extraordinary cash dividend after 2024.” The ordinary dividend will not only stay, but EQNR has pledged to grow it by 2 cents per share annually. That should result in a still-nice yield in this Norwegian energy major—but nothing approaching the wild 12.4% its most recent specials have produced. Business development companies (BDCs)—effectively private equity for us regular Joes—are extremely over-represented among companies offering regular-and-supplemental payouts. Among them are: Sixth Street Specialty Lending (TSLX) Listed Dividend Yield: 8.9% Dividend Yield With Specials: 10.0% I’m on record as saying Sixth Street Specialty Lending (TSLX) has “sterling dividend stewardship,” and that’s still the case today. Sixth Street is a flexible provider of funding to middle-market companies, dealing in senior secured loans, mezzanine debt, non-control structured equity and common equity. A quick look at its ideal investment prospects: Its portfolio currently sits at 115 companies spread across 15 “sector franchises,” such as sports/media/entertainment/telecom, credit market strategies, asset-based finance, and real estate. It boasts exciting names like gen-AI provider Sprinklr and parking compliance platform Passport, but also challenged retailers such as J.C. Penney and Bed Bath & Beyond. TSLX has largely been a well-managed BDC, though last quarter, it added a non-accrual (Lithium Technologies) to bring its total to three, representing roughly 2% of investments at fair value. That’s still a low level, however—Sixth Street still has a great track record of delivering high RoE and making intelligent deals. It also has a smart distribution system in which TSLX pays a core dividend, then distributes 50% of net investment income (NII) in excess of that core dividend as supplemental payouts, keeping the BDC from overextending itself. Over the past 12 months, specials have accounted for about 1.1 extra percentage points’ worth of yield. But we pretty much have to overpay to buy shares. TSLX stock routinely trades at a massive premium to net asset value (NAV), and that’s still the case today—its 22% premium puts it among the five most expensive BDCs right now. BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (TCPC) Listed Dividend Yield: 15.0% Dividend Yield With Specials: 16.1% BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (TCPC) is another BDC, this one externally managed, that invests in the debt of middle-market companies with enterprise values of between $100 million and $1.5 billion. TCPC currently has 156 companies in its portfolio, spread across a few dozen industries. But it does have a few heavier concentrations—internet software and services (~14%), software (~14%) and diversified financial services (~13%) earn double-digit weights. Earlier this year, TCPC merged with BlackRock Capital Investment Corp., which I previously mentioned came with a tangible benefit: a 25-basis-point reduction in base management fees, to 1.25%, bringing it a little lower than the industry midpoint. But I was also curious to see whether BlackRock TCP Capital would still keep its special dividends. Yes, I know—what does it matter if TCPC is already doling out a massive 15%? Well, it means that TCPC isn’t necessarily overpromising on its regular dividend. That said, the most recent dividend announcement marked a fifth consecutive regular payout of 34 cents per share, keeping it a penny shy of its pre-COVID levels and raising a little concern that TCPC’s dividend might be plateauing, at least in the short-term. The flip side? We can buy TCPC at a decent discount of 10% to NAV. However, portfolio quality isn’t as ideal as it is with TSLX. Non-accruals are close to 4% at fair value, and watchlist investments increased from 2.6% to 3%. Higher debt costs are weighing on operational performance, too. Carlyle Secured Lending (CGBD) Listed Dividend Yield: 9.5% Dividend Yield With Specials: 11.1% Carlyle Secured Lending (CGBD) is another externally managed BDC, and that manager is a subsidiary of multinational asset manager Carlyle Group (CG). CGBD invests primarily in U.S. middle market companies with between $25 million and $100 million in annual EBITDA. Its investments lean heavily toward first-lien debt (68%), though it also works through second-lien debt and equity, and it also holds investment funds. Its 128 portfolio companies cover a couple dozen industries, including healthcare/pharmaceuticals, software, aerospace/defense and leisure products/services. CGBD came public in 2017, but it has spent its short publicly traded life putting up extremely respectable returns, including mammoth outperformance coming out of the pandemic lows. Better still? Investors have been treated to both a growing base dividend (including an 8% raise in 2024), as well as regular supplemental payouts that have boosted yield by 1.6 percentage points over the past year. CGBD is building a stellar track record, but a few pockmarks are emerging. Lower short-term rates are putting downward pressure on its portfolio yield (it declined 70 bps last quarter), NAV per share and net investment income also declined in Q3, and repayments continue to run ahead of originations. Shares are even a little overheated, at a slight premium to NAV. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Cyber Monday Meta Quest 3 deals: Save $174 on new 3S bundle with this coupon

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more If you've waited this long to pick up one of the best Meta Quest Cyber Monday deals, then give yourself a quick pat on the back, then get yourself to the checkout with the bundle before it sells out again. The affordable VR headsets have been one of the most popular items in our roundup of best Cyber Monday deals and this is the last day for many promotions - we've some expire this morning. This best one still available is a Meta Quest 3S bundle that includes a free download code for the new Batman: Arkham Shadow game and a three-month subscription to Meta Quest+ to play a fresh rotating catalog of games. All this for $299 on the 128GB model at Amazon. That's a $74 saving today. Earlier, there were a couple of coupons (QUEST75 and QUEST100) on this deal for free Amazon credit, but that offer seems to have expired. Even so, it's worth trying them during the checkout process, just in case they get switched back on. Above bundles also come with three months of Meta Quest+. It's too soon to get a discount on the new Meta Quest 3S hardware, but the discounts on bundled extras are excellent today. All purchases currently come with a free download of the new Batman: Arkham Shadow VR game - which is lauded as one of the best titles you can play on the new headset. You'll certainly want to get it free, as buying the game separately costs $50. When the older Quest 3 launched last year, it came with Asura'a Wrath 2 for free for a while, and that game still costs $60 if bought separately, so don't sleep on this on these Meta Quest 3S bundles. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). Highlights Specifics The larger 256GB model of the new Quest 3S is for the more dedicated VR fan keen on downloading and storing a larger number of games and apps at once. VR newcomers would be better off saving some cash with the 128GB model in our book, though. Otherwise, you're getting the same excellent value headset, and all purchases currently include a code for the super-fun Batman: Arkham Shadow game (a $50 value). You're also getting three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The full-sized Meta Quest 3 is an odd duck right now. It's only a year old and still an excellent piece of hardware with a slightly better resolution than the new 3S, but it costs $200 more. Granted, you're getting a more advanced piece of kit (not by much, though, in all honesty) and a much larger storage capacity at 512GB instead of the 128GB/256GB options the 3S comes in. Meta has kept up production, though, and like the Quest 3S, you can get a free code for Batman: Arkham Shadow with purchases, which adds another $50 value to the deal below. We'll keep our eyes peeled for further discounts for the rest of the Cyber Monday sales. The slightly older Meta Quest 3 VR headset builds on its predecessor with mixed reality capabilities, 4K resolution, an upgraded processor that offers double the speed, and new ergonomics for the head unit and controllers. Like the newer 3S model it also comes with a free download code for the new Batman: Arkham Shadow VR game (worth $50). The larger 512GB version is the only one remaining, as the smaller ones have now been discontinued. Highlights Specifics The Meta Quest 2 (formerly known as the Oculus Quest 2) has officially been discontinued, and we haven't seen any new units in stock for quite some time. Plenty of refurbished ones are knocking around, but most are more expensive than the new Quest 3S, which is a poor value today, given the Quest 3S is a more advanced VR headset than the Quest 2. As such, we won't highlight deals for the Quest 2 unless they're ridiculously cheap - say $100-$150. And even then, they'll be refurbs/preowned. Nothing of note showed up on Black Friday, so we'd assume the same for the remaining time of Cyber Monday sales. Cyber Monday lands on December 2. While we often see a few deals hang on for a few extra days, the really strong hardware ones usually snap shut right at the end of Cyber Monday itself. We'd go off midnight PT as a rule of thumb, but waiting that long is a luxury you shouldn't indulge with the best bundles, especially that mad Amazon. Both are already involved, yes. The main Quest 3 is over a year old, so it is in a great position to be discounted - and it needs one, to be honest, given the 3S is much cheaper and the best option for most buyers. So far, it's just bundled freebies instead of a discount. That being said, Meta discontinued the 128GB one and made the 512GB one the only option, but lowered the price of it to the 128's old price at $499. So you're already getting a better deal than last year. However, we still think you should be eyeing up the Cyber Monday Quest 3S deals above instead. The Meta Quest 3S was only released in October this year, but even so, it's come up with the best bundle options so far, with free extras worth up to $174 on the 128GB model.

No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—and some are at the lowest we’ve ever seen. If you want to know what Apple is doing for Cyber Monday, it’s offering gift cards up to $200/£160 with select purchases. We have the details of that deal and what’s included in our Apple’s 2024 Black Friday Shopping Event article. Cyber Monday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page up to and throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B&H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October 2024. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM unless it’s much more than $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model. U.S. Foundry Additionally, Apple’s older MacBook Pro models are on clearance as retailers look to clear out remaining stock: U.K. Apple’s older MacBook models are on clearance at the following retailers: The iMac and Mac mini both received new M4 chips in October, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that. Save money off a new iMac. Foundry U.S. There are savings on the older models as well: For more monitors for your Mac look at Best Mac monitor deals for Black Friday U.K. In the U.K. when Apple announced the iMac and Mac mini in 2024 it dropped prices compared to the previous generation, so keep this in mind if considering a discount on an M3 model. These older models are also discounted: The AirPods 4 with and without ANC are Apple’s newest earbuds that replaced the AirPods generation 2 and 3 in September. Apple also updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise, it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday, but this year beware: you may see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is that even if you see a good deal on the AirPods 3 you should spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. The AirPods 4 without ANC cost $129/£129 and compare very favorably with the AirPods 3 which used to cost $179/£179. AirPods 4 are Apple’s newest earbuds and are already on sale. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. There are also savings on older models, but as we mentioned above, we recommend skipping any AirPods 3rd gen deals because the AirPods 4 are much better. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra. Traditionally, any savings around $50 is an excellent deal. Look out for the Apple Watch Series 9 as there may be some deals on the discontinued model. U.S. U.K. Apple updated all of its iPads in 2024 with the exception of the 10th-gen entry-level model (though it did get a price cut to $349). The iPad mini was the most recent model to get a refresh, with a new chip and 8GB of RAM. We are seeing some good deals on new iPads. Foundry U.S. If you’re buying a new Apple Pencil the Apple Pencil Pro is the newest model and compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. The USB-C Apple Pencil is also compatible with these models as well as the 10th-gen iPad, but doesn’t have squeeze gestures or magnetic charging. If you see a deal on any Apple Pencils make sure they work with your iPad first. U.K. U.S. Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. You can read our best Black Friday iPhone deals roundup for more information. However, there are some discounts on previous models: U.K. David Price / Foundry There are Cyber Monday deals on many of the streamers, for example, Hulu is bundling Disney+ for a saving of 85 percent (just $2.99 a month). Peacock has 75 percent off at $1.99 a month for six months. Paramount is offering a couple of months at $2.99. Britbox is offering subscriptions for $8 a month, 50 percent off the usual price. Sadly Apple isn’t discounting Apple TV+, however, as we explain in How to get Apple TV+ for free you can get much more than Apple’s 7-day trial or even Apple’s 3 months for free if you buy an Apple product. In fact, there are even some Cyber Monday deals: As for Apple’s set-top box, there are small savings to be had, but this is a case where it would be better to buy from Apple and get the $25 voucher with it. See our round-up of the Best Apple TV deals. U.S. U.K. In October, Apple updated its Mac accessories with USB-C ports but didn’t bring any other changes. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. Every year Apple holds a shopping event from Black Friday (November 29) to Cyber Monday (December 2).

Title: 370 Absolute Best Cyber Monday Deals (2024)

Cyber Monday 2024 Cyber Monday Deals Cyber Monday Tech Deals Best Buy Deals Cyber Monday Apple Deals Cyber Monday Laptop Deals Cyber Monday Toy Deals Cyber Monday Coffee Deals Cyber Monday Mattress Deals Cyber Monday Outdoor Deals Cyber Monday TV Deals Cyber Monday Camera Deals Branch Cyber Monday Deals If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Cyber Monday may be over, but the deals are still going strong—for now. Whether you're checking off your holiday shopping or snagging a special treat for yourself, now's the time to pounce. Every item on this list has been vetted, tested, and loved by someone at WIRED. Our Gear team has cross-checked these picks with our buying guides to ensure you're getting the lowest prices—or close to it. Don't wait too long, though. These prices won't stick around forever—some may already expire by the time you reach the end of this story. Jump to Category Our Process We test products year-round and handpicked these deals. To find you the best deals, we use a proprietary tool that scans prices on everything we've reviewed over the last two years and spotlights notable price changes. We then pore over massive spreadsheets by hand and pick the best of the best deals. Samsung's S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best TVs you can buy right now, offering vivid yet naturalistic colors, class-leading brightness, and near-infinite contrast and perfect black levels that make OLED TVs so gobsmacking to gaze at. Outside its stellar performance, you’ll get a loaded suite of gaming features, including four HDMI 2.1 inputs for advanced gameplay, a dedicated game bar, and Samsung's Game Hub to stream from services like Xbox Game Pass. The one notable drawback for all Samsung TVs is their lack of Dolby Vision HDR, which is more prevalent than Samsung’s dynamic alternative, HDR10+. Even so, I’d happily have this stylish beauty as my primary display, offering picture quality that’s among the best I’ve seen all year at its best price yet. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s Bravia 9 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-performing backlit TV around. It blends next-gen brightness with Sony’s proprietary dimming and picture processing to provide stunningly balanced performance across the board. The TV’s brightness pushes toward the psychedelic when called upon, but with measured dispersal to keep from blowing your eyeballs out. On the other end, you’ll experience OLED-like black levels and contrast, and 4K detail that pops off the screen. Sony only offers two HDMI 2.1 ports, meaning you’re losing two slots for gaming consoles over competitors, and the TV’s off-axis viewing is good, not great. That’s the price you’ll pay for brilliance that outdoes even the most fiery OLED displays. If you’ve been looking for a good sale on the best LED TV out there, your search is over. —Ryan Waniata The price of Sony’s impressive Bravia 7 TV (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has sunk like a stone. I took points off the score for its poor off-axis performance, but if you’re watching mostly from straight on, this TV rocks. You’ll get stunning clarity and detail, excellent brightness, vibrant quantum dot colors, and deep black levels thanks to the same algorithm that helps Sony’s Bravia 9 TV look so good. Like all of Sony’s premium TVs, the Bravia 7 offers only two HDMI 2.1 ports, limiting your options for high-performance gaming when compared to some of the best TVs in its class. Otherwise, this is a sweet screen for hundreds less than its inflated launch price. —Ryan Waniata Hisense's 65-inch U7N QLED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our choice as the best TV for most people right now, thanks to its impressive performance and features for the money. The TV’s swarm of mini LED backlights serve up fiery brightness and deep black levels with minimal light bleed, meaning the picture looks great in the daylight and the dark. It’s got great gaming features, including VRR (variable refresh rate) for gaming at up to 144 kHz from its high-refresh panel, and an intuitive Google TV smart system to run the show. Videophiles will likely notice some dirty screen effect—this is a value model after all—and like nearly all backlit TVs, its off-axis viewing is just OK. Still, there’s little to complain about in this well-balanced package, serving up big 4K thrills at a crazy-low price. —Ryan Waniata If you’re after a solid screen at a sweet price, Roku’s baseline Plus Series could be right up your alley. It all starts with the fantastic Roku operating system that makes it remarkably simple to call up connected devices, grab any app, and even track down your remote with a built-in chime. Frankly, that last feature is so fundamental I can’t believe it isn’t standard in all modern TVs. The Plus Series’ panel only offers a 60-Hz refresh rate, so it’s not the best option for serious gamers, but it’s a solid performer thanks to good brightness and punchy colors. Thanks to local dimming, you won’t see blotchy patches when the lights are down, either. Support for Apple Homekit, Alexa, and Google Assistant rounds out the package for a great budget buy. —Ryan Waniata For those looking to see the blaze of summer in the dead of winter, Hisense’s 65-inch U8N TV serves up stunning brightness that nearly doubles many TVs in its price class. All that power doesn’t come at the cost of contrast, as the TV provides excellent black levels with minimal light bleed, alongside vivid quantum dot colors to let you bask in its sizzling punch in any lighting. You’ll also get the latest gaming features, a breezy Google TV interface, and every major flavor of HDR. The off-axis viewing isn’t anything to write home about, but this TV feels more premium than it has a right to for under $1,000. Looking to go bigger? The 75-inch version is still reasonable at $1,300, or you can go nuclear with the 85-incher for $300 more. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Apple’s latest iPad Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with several internal upgrades. With an A17 Pro chip, it can handle both graphically demanding games and Apple Intelligence (the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features) with ease. It also has support for the feature-packed Apple Pencil Pro. All of this is packed into a tiny build that’s great for traveling with—whether you’re using it for gaming or reading ebooks. —Brenda Stolyar This is the latest Apple Pencil to join the lineup. Unlike the 1st and 2nd-gen versions, it comes with a “squeeze” capability that triggers the tool palette (you can use double-tap as well) and a haptic engine that delivers feedback when you squeeze the stylus. The built-in gyroscope sensor also allows you to change the orientation of each tool as you twist it, giving you finer control. It’s only compatible with the iPad Air (M2), iPad Pro (M4), and iPad Mini (A17 Pro). —Brenda Stolyar The iMac with M4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a few notable upgrades, including a 12-megapixel webcam with support for Center Stage, the option to add a nano-texture display, and the accessories now come with USB-C ports. Powered by the latest M4 chip, it delivers great performance too. It’s currently our favorite desktop in our guide to Best All-in-One Computers. —Brenda Stolyar This MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) with M1 is the cheapest MacBook you can buy. Although the M1 came out back in 2020, it’s still a speedy and capable chip for simple tasks and basic activities (like web browsing, sending emails, and word processing) along with light video editing. It also has solid battery life and will easily last you an entire day. It’s a good option if you’re looking for a reliable MacBook without breaking the bank. —Brenda Stolyar Apple recently launched the M4-powered versions of the MacBook Pro, but the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains a great option. It has a bright display with mini-LED and a 1080p webcam built in. You’ll also get a 120-Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling. As usual, it packs plenty of ports, including two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4, an HDMI, a MagSafe charging port, an SD card slot, and a high-impedance headphone jack. We recommend it if you don’t want to spend over $2,000 on a MacBook Pro. —Brenda Stolyar This is one of our top picks in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. The low-profile keys are satisfying to type on, while the slim and lightweight build is easy to travel with for those who like to take their peripherals on the go. It mimics the MacBook keyboard too, complete with a Do Not Disturb key and the option to program the function row key with Apple’s own apps like Keynote, Final Cut Pro, Safari, and more. It’s only available with tactile quiet switches, though. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite keyboard case for iPads. The first half protects the back of the iPad and also comes with a kickstand while the second half has a detachable keyboard and trackpad. The case is not only durable and sturdy but also feels great to type on. Instead of Bluetooth, it connects using Apple’s Smart Connector so you don’t have to worry about draining battery life. It’s available for the base iPad (7th, 8th, and 9th Gen) along with the iPad Air (5th Gen and M2) and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st Gen and newer), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (5th and 6th Gen), as well as the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro with M4. —Brenda Stolyar Logitech's Casa Pop-Up Desk (9/10, WIRED Review) is a great solution for those who constantly work on the go but prefer using an external keyboard and mouse with your laptop. Instead of carrying all those accessories around, the Casa Pop-Up Desk includes a keyboard and trackpad that fit neatly into a compact case that doubles as a laptop stand. It’s expensive, but it’s worth it if you’re always working out of the house. —Brenda Stolyar This is a great accessory if you want to use your iPhone as a webcam. Thanks to a feature called Continuity Camera, you can use your iPhone as a webcam for a MacBook (you can check out these instructions for how to set it up). The circular silicone puck magnetically connects to your iPhone (it also doubles as a kickstand or phone grip), and there’s a section that pops out so you can mount the iPhone on top of a MacBook. Since it utilizes the rear camera, the Belkin allows for a more natural video-calling experience and better image quality than the standard MacBook webcam. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This Bluetooth-connected portable board finally got my 7- and 9-year-old interested in chess. The pieces feel wonderfully matte and heavy to play with. It connects to the GoChess app on your phone, which is integrated with Lichess and Chess.com. You can play against other people or get AI-enabled suggestions in person, and the board lights up to guide you. My kids will pick up pieces and discuss moves for hours. It's great.—Adrienne So A firm WIRED favorite and one of the best family board games, Ticket to Ride features steam engine styling and rules that are easy to grasp. All you must do is claim railway routes across the US and Canada using your colorful plastic rail cars. Spend cards to claim routes, rack up bonus points for connecting specific destinations, and the person with the highest score at the end wins. All aboard, choo, choo! —Simon Hill If your kid is learning how to ride a bike, a Guardian bike is not that much more expensive than a big box store bike, and it weighs around 10 pounds less. Guardian's proprietary SureStop brake system which means the rear wheel will always brake before the front wheel, so your kid will never flip over. It works. I gave my kid's bike to a 20-year-old ding-dong to test in an empty parking garage, and he couldn't flip it.—Adrienne So Inspired by the Royal Palace of Evora in Portugal, with its Moorish blue-and-white ceramic tiles, this board game challenges you to make mosaics by matching tiles with different patterns and colors to amass the maximum possible score. One of the best family board games for all tastes, Azul is easy to grasp but supports many tactical approaches and has surprising depth. The beautiful tiles and other components are high quality, and filling your board is deeply satisfying. Play moves quickly, and you can complete a game in less than an hour, but you will probably want to play again immediately. —Simon Hill Start with a randomly generated map of hexagonal tiles in this addictive family board game, and gather and trade resources to develop your civilization and win. Amassing enough victory points requires a smart strategy and some dice-rolling luck. Catan is easy to get the hang of and only takes around an hour to finish. Players can trade freely, but the robber mechanic can cause arguments, so set some ground rules. The modular randomization makes for excellent replay value, and there are expansions and spin-offs to further complicate the gameplay. This game is for three or four players aged 10 years and up. —Simon Hill This cat-themed card game is easy to pick up and perfect for a quick game. The aim is to avoid exploding kitten cards by wielding a comical cast of cats with special powers. Timing and strategy are essential to get the best of your opponents. This fun card game appears in our best family board games guide. If it’s a hit with your fam, there are countless expansion packs worth trying. —Simon Hill One of the best family board games for larger groups, Herd Mentality is all about writing down the same answer as everyone else. If you agree with the majority of players on the best pizza topping, Disney movie, or the smallest animal that could carry your weight, you win a cow token. Eight tokens win you the game, but if you are the odd one out, you get the pink cow of doom. It’s funny and easy to play with any group. —Simon Hill I’m going to be honest with you: I hate these blinky, twinkly, one-trick-pony toys because my kids play with them for a week or two and then put them away forever. (Give them sets or skills they can build on, like games, Lego, or instruments.) Nevertheless, I make an exception because Sphero’s toys are so delightful and this price is ridiculous. My colleague Simon Hill’s wife uses this coding ball as a classroom aid to teach basic coding skills to 9-year-olds and older. It’s adorable and can move and navigate mazes through infrared communication. —Adrienne So Loog Guitars is holding a sitewide sale for 40 percent off that ends tonight. This is cheating a bit, because my kids already know how to play piano and violin, but the Loog electric guitar is the fastest I've ever seen them pick up an instrument. The app is fun and engaging and my son even tuned it himself. (It's also an excuse to get on the iPad, grrr.) —Adrienne So This rock tumbler is perfect for any aspiring rock hound, and we say as much in our STEM toys buying guide. The kit includes four levels of grit, plus a bag of rough gemstones so they can get started tumbling during Christmas break. According to the Amazon reviews, this tumbler is also used and liked by some adults who've been putting rocks in their pockets for decades. —Adrienne So This stylish Lego set is from the botanicals collection, and can be loved by Lego fans and interior design fans alike. It’s a fun set to build with a person, too, since it’s built in two near-identical halves that you and someone else can make at the same time and then connect together. The finished piece has lived everywhere from my entryway to my dining room table to various shelves, and it’s looked good in every single spot. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you use Samsung devices, this is a great triple wireless charger for your Galaxy phone, Galaxy smartwatch, and Galaxy earbuds. Since it’s Qi-compatible, you can also use it to charge other devices as well—including iPhones. It also has LEDs that light up quickly when you place your gadgets down on it, and it also comes with a 25-watt wall charger and USB-C cable. However, it doesn’t work with all Galaxy watches. We found that it was, however, compatible with the Watch4 and older Watch3. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite MagSafe dash mount for the iPhone 12 or later. You can attach it via dashboard pad or windshield with a suction cup—both of which proved secure in our testing. There’s also a telescopic arm that combines with a ball joint for a wide range of movement, allowing you to find the ideal position. The USB-C charging cable is removable too, so you can store it when it’s not in use. There’s also a built-in fan to help keep you cool when it gets hot outside. Our only gripe is that it tops out at 7.5 watts for charging. —Brenda Stolyar Durable and versatile, this power bank slips easily into a bag and has a nice grippy, textured finish. The yellow is easy to spot in a crowded tent, and the segmented LED shows the remaining power in blocks of 10 percent. The Charge 100 Max can charge up to five gadgets at once, and the wireless charging pad on top is handy in the dark when you don’t want to fumble with cables. This is the outdoors pick in our Best Portable Chargers guide. —Simon Hill We particularly love Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro for its compact design and support for 15-watt wireless charging. The prongs also cling to your vent securely and the array of magnets allow for a strong hold with MagSafe-enabled iPhones. With a ball joint, you can also angle your phone slightly for a better view of the screen. Unfortunately, the USB-C cable is permanently attached. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top 3-in-1 wireless charger if you want to utilize Apple’s StandBy Mode. Introduced with iOS 17, it turns your iPhone into a smart display. With Twelve South’s charger, you can place it in landscape mode to trigger the feature while also simultaneously charging two other devices on the base such as your Apple Watch or AirPods. —Brenda Stolyar Belkin’s Stand Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with DockKit integration, which means it can use the iPhone’s camera to track your face while the 360-degree base automatically moves around to keep you in frame. It’s great for those who FaceTime a lot and find themselves searching for objects to prop the phone on. It’s also an excellent accessory for content creators who want to record hands-free video on the go. With a built-in battery, you don’t need to worry about being near a power source either. But with support for MagSafe, you can also use it as a charger. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The best air fryers help you cook quickly and potentially with less fat or oil. These compact convection ovens heat up fast to make crispy chicken, fries, and donuts. This Cosori model is our favorite smart air fryer because you can remotely control it using a smartphone or tablet (it also has a digital control panel). We like the slick, black, classy design. The cooking drawer has a smooth action, and the handle stays cool, though the sides can get hot, so it needs plenty of space. Temperature options range from 175 degrees Fahrenheit to a powerful 400, with 12 handy preset cooking modes. —Simon Hill The Typhur dome air fryer cooks with blazing speed and has a modern round shape that I enjoyed in my testing. It’s easy to clean and has intuitive controls. —Martin Cizmar I love Cync's smart light bulbs, but the lights I use most by Cync are now the Undercabinet Pick Lights. They're easy to install under your cabinets, and easy to control over the app or a smart speaker. These undercabinet lights can do a variety of shades of whites, colors, and even fun effects that Cync calls Light Shows (my favorite is the candle option for moody fall lighting). They're usually $85, so getting three pucks to put under your kitchen cabinets is a nice discount. I used four pucks for four cabinets, two on either side of my cabinets around my oven, so I recommend at least two packs if you have cabinets split up by an oven. —Nena Farrell The Nutribullet Ultra is one of the best blenders we’ve tested. It’s stylish and has simple controls, and the 1,200-watt motor is powerful enough to handle all your smoothies, dips, and sauces. The 30-second blend is usually enough to get through your ingredients, but you might have to run a second cycle if you want the smoothest consistencies. The five-year warranty and suction cup feet are icing on the cake. Er, smoothie. We’ve seen this blender drop to $90 before, but anything below $110 is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe If you don't want to spring for the Thermapen above, the ThermoPop is a great budget option. It's not as fast, but it's still fast and the large, back-lit, auto-rotating screen is easy to read. It's waterproof, and accurate to plus or minus one degree. —Scott Gilbertson Instant-read thermometers are a kitchen essential. Can you prod your steak with a finger and accurately temp it? I think not. The Thermapen One will tell you the exact internal temperature in one second; no need for elaborate guesswork. Cheap instant-read thermometers litter Amazon, but we like the more expensive Thermapen One for its reliability and speed. The speed is important because the longer that oven door is open, the more unevenly you end up cooking. At this price, why not get the best? —Scott Gilbertson For those who want an air fryer but don’t want to devote the hefty counter space to a full-sized device, the WIRED Gear team’s favorite compact model is this nifty little Ninja, which is clocking in at a hefty discount. The cooker is still quite versatile for a wee thing, with settings that include max crisp, air fry, air roast, air broil, bake, reheat, and dehydrate. Our tester even managed to successfully bake a little chocolate cake. —Matthew Korfhage If you’ve been meaning to cut down on single-use plastics, now’s your chance. We love Stasher’s silicone bags, which are reusable and versatile, whether you’re meal prepping, storing leftovers, or cooking sous vide (7/10, WIRED Recommends). They’re dishwasher and microwave-safe, leakproof, and designed to last through thousands of uses. At $9, it’s a small price to pay for a sustainable swap you’ll use daily. —Boutayna Chokrane This excellent blender is durable and powerful. It’s got a generous 8-cup capacity and 10 blend settings. It gets pretty loud on the fastest setting, but our tester’s hummus was smooth in 30 seconds. The Braun has a touchscreen with several preset modes for things like smoothies, soups, spreads, frozen desserts, and more. The jar is made of Tritan, a type of impact-resistant plastic, rather than glass, but if that doesn’t bother you, this is a good deal on a reliable model. —Louryn Strampe We’ve tested a lot of food processors, and this model from KitchenAid is the very best we’ve tried. It comes in four colors and has a solid 9-cup capacity which has enough room to make servings for a family of four. The blades and discs can be stored in the bowl and the base has storage for the cord. You’ll get a multipurpose blade, a dough blade, a slicing disc, a julienne disc, and a whisk accessory. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked. —Louryn Strampe The Enso is the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall soda maker: durable, simple, sturdy, easy to use, and so intuitive you can make soda with one hand while skimming the news with your phone. If you use the HOLIDAY40 code on SodaStream’s website, it’s 40 percent off. —Matthew Korfhage This egg cooker fluctuates in price all the time, but this is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen it. It’s featured in our “Buy It for Life” guide. WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu says his wife loves this little countertop appliance, which can cook eggs in a myriad of different ways. Poach, soft-boil, hard-boil, or even whip up an omelet. It’ll chime to let you know when breakfast is served. It’s available in several cute colors like aqua, powder blue, and red. —Louryn Strampe How is a coffee warmer smart? Hint: It’s not because it uploads your habits to a cloud server. It’s smart because it turns itself on when you put a flat-bottomed coffee mug on top of it, and keeps your coffee warm at about 130 degrees. And it turns itself off when you remove the mug. So your coffee stays warm, and you don’t have to think about it. It makes for a great gift to anyone who likes, you know, warm beverages. —Matthew Korfhage Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals There has never been a better time to buy a robot vacuum. Even as the technology advances by leaps and bounds, many older models remain perfectly capable—and sometimes more than grand cheaper. The Q5 Pro+ has now been supplanted by Roborock’s Qrevo line, but this was our top pick for over a year and Roborock vacuums age well. I have a 6-year-old Roborock on the upper story of my house that is still going strong. —Adrienne So Dyson's V12 Detect Slim (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Dyson vacuum if you have a small space, like a studio apartment or one-bedroom. It’s compact and lightweight, weighing only five pounds and just four feet long, and it’s perfect for both stashing in a small space and for vacuuming just a room or two since it has a run time of up to 60 minutes. It also comes with a variety of attachments. All and all, it’s pretty powerful for such a compact size. —Nena Farrell The Gen5Detect is one of the latest vacuums in Dyson’s lineup. The company swapped the trigger for a single power button and the Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head now shoots out a laser that’s twice as bright. It packs the fastest motor yet, too, spinning at 135,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) with a suction power of 265 air watts (AW). Dyson added a HEPA filter as well, which Dyson says traps 99.99 percent of particles down to 0.1 microns. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite budget vacuum in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. A couple of years ago, the company updated the Motorbar Cleaner with its hair-detangling technology and hair screw tool. It has improved filtration too, with the ability to trap 99.99 percent of fine dust. This vacuum also converts into a hand vac, so you don’t have to buy a separate one. The battery should also last up to 40 minutes and takes about 5.5 hours to fully charge. If you're purchasing the vacuum from Kohl's, it's worth noting the sale ends at midnight. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top pick in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. It’s lightweight (at under 7 pounds), so it’s super easy to maneuver. My favorite feature is the green laser that shoots out of the front of the motorized head to help illuminate microscopic dust particles. There’s also a sensor built into the vacuum that counts the number and size of dust particles it’s sucking up. You can see the data on the LCD in real time. As for battery life, you’ll get a 60-minute run time while the battery itself takes up to 4.5 hours to charge. It’s pricey, but the features and performance are worth it. —Brenda Stolyar If you’re not interested in one of Dyson’s standard vacuums, you can opt for a robot vacuum instead. With a spin speed of 110,000 RPM, this one is super powerful. It also has a digital display and a filter that’s easy to remove and clean. According to Dyson, it also has six times more suction than the competition. It also comes equipped with a “triple-action” brush bar, which includes soft nylon for large debris on hard floors, antistatic carbon-fiber filaments for fine dust, and stiff nylon bristles for carpet. —Brenda Stolyar Top of our best carpet cleaners guide, this vacuum did an excellent job removing cat hair and lingering odors. It’s easy to use, comes with two removable tanks, and has a special spray jet to target stains. Fill the top tank to the marked lines with warm water and detergent, pull a trigger on the handle to wet wash, and then run over the area slowly and watch the bottom tank fill with dirty water. You can choose from three modes (Max, Deep, and Express), and it comes with multiple attachments, including one for upholstery and another for stairs. —Simon Hill Shark’s AI Ultra 2-in-1 mopping vacuum earned a “Most Improved Award” from me in 2022; the company recently replaced it with the Matrix. Shark’s products can be hit or miss, but happily I liked the Matrix very much. It has multifunctional vacuuming and mopping and is pretty reliable. It doesn’t need replacement dust bags—which is both a blessing and a curse, as the self-emptying dustbin sometimes doesn’t empty quite all the way. —Adrienne So The PetSafe ScoopFree SmartSpin Self-Cleaning Litter Box is around half the price of other popular (and expensive) automatic litter box models, and has a similar design. This futuristic-looking pod on legs has a weight detector that sets off the cleaning cycle a few minutes after your cat has gone to the bathroom, and has a slide-out tray in the bottom. It’s also connected to an app so that you review your cat’s toilet visits, where each entry displays the time they went, their weight, and trip duration. This box works surprisingly well and is a cheap alternative if you really hate taking out the litter but don’t want to shell out the big bucks. —Molly Higgins Like all of the Petlibro products I tested for my Automatic Pet Feeder guide, the One RFID Smart Feeder is a super-techy and sleek cat product. For this feeder, the pet wears a collar with a tag in which the feeder’s lid opens and retracts over the kibble when the cat approaches or leaves, ensuring that only the chosen pet with the collar can access the food. In my review, I called this “a nearly perfect device for a particular kind of pet owner.” I think this feeder would work best for a cat in a dog home, if one particular cat has special dietary needs, or if you have a multi-cat home with an aggressive eater. At only a little over 100 bucks, this would be a good time to snag and see if this product would work well for your pet. —Molly Higgins Petlibro’s Polar Wet Food Feeder is a smart little invention and first of its kind in the Automatic Pet Feeder realm—it’s basically a minifridge that operates via the app to deliver wet food that can be safely stored for up to 3 days. You can customize feeding schedules via the app and the Polar even shuts off cooling 30 minutes before feeding to make sure the food is not too cold if your cat is as picky as mine. I already have one at home, but at a great value for less than a hundred bucks right now ($80), I’m ordering a second one for my other cat. Gone are the days of them screeching for a can of wet food at 5 am. —Molly Higgins The best smart Christmas lights you can buy are on sale. Perfect timing if you need to upgrade. Easy to set up, with a black or green cord that blends nicely into the tree, Twinly’s lights support all kinds of colors and animated effects via the app, and you can also make custom effects. You can design based on an existing pattern, draw with your fingers, or even upload a GIF. Draped on a tree, the lights are best with gradient and stripe-style patterns, like the candy cane stripe effect. —Simon Hill One of the cheapest and best Govee smart lights you can buy is this affordable light strip that comes in several lengths. It is designed to be hidden behind furniture, so you just see the reflected light. We are highlighting the longest 100-foot option here, but all are segmented to display multiple colors, can be controlled wirelessly from the app or using voice controls, and support Govee’s enormous variety of lighting effects. These light strips also appear in our best smart lighting guide. —Simon Hill Nanoleaf makes fantastic wall light panels that double as light and home decor. The brand is famous for the hexagon sets, but Nanoleaf has expanded into other shapes, including triangles and light strips and even ceiling panels, in the past several years. This seven-pack of Nanoleaf Shapes Triangles is a fun size to use around the TV, in your office, or on any wall that could use a little fun added to it. It's a solid sale price, too, making it a good time to buy. —Nena Farrell If you’re looking for a great sunrise alarm clock for the price, you can’t do better than the Philips SmartSleep Wake-Up Light, especially now that it’s on sale. It’s a great little lamp that gets plenty bright to help you rise, and is easy to use and set up, too. It doesn’t have any nighttime routine options, but if you aren’t worried about those, this is a great purchase. —Nena Farrell If you're interested in light panels for your walls but want ones that will look just as nice when they're off as when they're turned on, Nanoleaf's Elements are a great choice. They’re our pick in the Best Nanoleaf Smart Lights for infrequent use since they have a wood finish, so you'll gain a more natural style statement when they’re turned off. These lights only glow in shades of white, so you’ll lose out on the rainbow aspect. Still, it's a nice trade-off, and you can get these on sale for almost $100 off right now. —Nena Farrell I'm not surprised this frame is on sale—Skylight just launched a new version earlier this fall, and it's fantastic, allowing you to switch out the frame style at will. This original model is still a solid digital photo frame, and it’s the best sale price you’ll find right now on digital photo frames. —Nena Farrell OK, we know you know about Ember’s temperature-controlled mugs, but Ohom’s is a whole different—and much simpler—beast. It’s not overengineered; you don’t have to connect it to your phone, check an app, and get constant phone pings. Instead, it looks and feels exactly like your favorite ceramic mug and the set keeps your coffee at the temperature you want to drink. That’s it! The heating pad also works as a charging pad! Just don’t put the mug in the microwave (which you shouldn’t anyway, because that makes coffee taste gross) and you’re good to go. —Adrienne So I’ve had this boxy model in my kitchen for over two years now to mitigate some of the combustion particulates from my gas stove, and this is one of the best sales for it I’ve seen. I especially appreciate that its HEPA replacement filters are both easy to find and inexpensive (Amazon has them for $26 for two). WIRED contributor Lisa Wood Shapiro also notes in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers that it has an excellent air exchange rate for small rooms, cleaning the air in 361 square feet at the recommended rate of 4.8 times per hour. —Kat Merck The Airmega 250 from clean air leader Coway provides the industrial vibe your home or loft needs. The warm gray box looks like a high-end speaker. And the Airmega 250 can do four air exchanges an hour when fitted for a 465-square-foot room. Utilizing a HEPA filter, this CARB-certified air purifier also has a washable prefilter along with an activated carbon filter to capture odors and VOCs. It has a built-in air quality sensor with indicator light and an easy-to-use control panel. It’s not app-compatible but does have a three-year warranty and runs at a relatively quiet 22 decibels. —Lisa Wood Shapir It takes a special screwdriver to deal with the soft, tiny, often infuriating screws that manufacturers love to use on anything from laptops to eyeglasses to remote controls–and these tiny screws often gatekeep simple repairs. Our Gear team’s testers haven’t been too impressed with multi-tools for screwdrivers this small. Get a good, tiny set like this Wiha 7-in-1 instead. —Matthew Korfhage The “super plush” name is true to the core. This super-soft robe is what I grab after every shower—my towel just has hair duty these days. It's a cozy robe that can dry you off while you're doing your hair, and it dries nicely for my next shower. If I were shopping for a new one, I'd jump for one of the cute striped options. Brooklinen often runs sales, but 25 percent off this robe is better than you'll usually find. —Nena Farrell This Arlo model has everything you need in an indoor security camera, including crisp 2K video at 24 frames per second, two-way audio, and a compact design that includes a privacy shutter. You can expect a quick loading feed in the Arlo app, useful smart notifications, and two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face if your phone allows. Sadly, you need a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This is the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide. —Simon Hill While it’s not our top pick, Google’s Nest Cam does make our list of the best outdoor security cameras and is a solid choice if you have a Nest Doorbell or other Google gadgets. The HD resolution is limited, but that’s offset by the HDR and high frame rate, and the face recognition is the best we have tested in a security camera. The Nest Aware subscription at $8 a month ($80/year) is too much if you only have a single camera, but that price covers multiple devices. —Simon Hill I love my Reolink doorbell, which does everything I need it to without the hassles of a glitchy app that needs to be updated every two weeks or any monthly fee. Don’t take my word for it, though: When my curling club needed a security system, another club member, who installs security cameras professionally, suggested we skip pricier options and just do a Reolink system. We’ve got an Reolink Altas PT Ultra (on sale for $160, which is $70 off) running inside over the bar and a solar-powered REOLINK Argus 4 Pro (on sale for $140 which is $80 off) running in the parking lot, which has drawn rave reviews based on the low cost (curling is a Scottish sport and thriftiness is part of the culture) and the fact that the whole leadership structure can access the footage from their phones via the Home Hub ($99). —Martin Cizmar These affordable Govee Wi-Fi Water Sensors are quick and easy to install, and send alerts as push notifications and emails to warn you when there’s a leak. With a very loud siren (100 decibels) you will hear them if you are home, and you can shut off the sound from the app. The sensors are compact with drip detection on top and metal feet for leak detection beneath. Alerts triggered within a few seconds in my tests, earning them a place in our best water leak detectors guide. The app is basic but works well and gives you an alert history. They do require a Govee Wi-Fi hub (included), which needs a power outlet, and it’s big enough that it may block an adjacent outlet. Each sensor also needs two AA batteries (provided). —Simon Hill Mattresses are frequently advertised with inflated discounts, and this mattress from Nectar was only $100 more than this earlier in November. However, it’s still a big discount on an all-foam mattress that’s solidly on the soft side despite being advertised as “medium firm.” —Martin Cizmar The original millennial bed-in-a-box has been sold a few times in recent years and recently went through a full-line redesign. I was impressed with the new Casper baseline mattress during my week of testing, as it retains a classic memory foam feel but is more firm and supportive than many competitors. We originally linked the queen version but it's not available, other sizes are. —Martin Cizmar Brooklinen's Cyber Monday sale ends on Tuesday night, with 25 percent off the entire site and up to 50 percent off bundles. There are a ton of great sheets worth shopping there, from the linen to the sateen, but Brooklinen's percale is my favorite of their sheet options. It's a nice crisp sheet and has an organic option (on sale for $172) that's a touch softer than the regular version. Both the organic and the classic percale sets are on sale right now for 25 percent off. —Nena Farrell Cozy Earth's Bamboo Sheet Set has been on the top of our Best Sheets guide ever since we started testing sheets, and it’s a star of our new Best Bamboo Sheets guide, too. These sheets, made with bamboo viscose, feel insanely soft and downright chilly to the touch before warming up like melted butter around you as you sleep. It's a downright decadent sheet set that's usually a splurge, which is why Cozy Earth's sale is the perfect time to shop. —Nena Farrell I've tried a lot of wearable breast pumps. They're supremely handy to use, but the Medela Freestyle (7/10, WIRED Recommends) will always be a favorite of mine because it was the most lightweight and had the least amount of parts to clean. And if you pump often, or even just once a day, having less cleaning to do feels like a lifesaver. The motor is in the handheld controller that you can pop in your pocket rather than weighing down your bra. It's comfortable, handy, and on sale for a great price compared to what you'll usually find it for. —Nena Farrell This handy little drill is a home tool kit essential. It’s got enough power to handle tasks that need extra torque, and the half-inch chuck will accept basically every drill bit size. This kit includes two batteries and a charger, and the batteries are also compatible with other DeWalt tools. This deal comes within $10 of the best we’ve seen. If you need bits, we recommend this kit, which is also on sale. —Louryn Strampe This inexpensive kit is full of our favorite drill bits. The black oxide coating both reduces friction and resists rust, and the drill bits can handle wood, metal, plastics, wallboard, and fiberglass. These go on sale frequently, but this is still a good get, especially if you’re picking up the discounted DeWalt drill that we also recommend. —Louryn Strampe Luxome's bamboo sheets are the best bamboo sheets you can buy, with fantastic quality made from bamboo viscose (which is better than bamboo rayon!), tons of gorgeous colors from which to choose, a fantastically silky-soft feel, and a good price point. Luxome is hosting its only sale of the year right now, so you can get these amazing sheets for even cheaper than usual. The white color has an extra $5 discount if you don’t mind missing out on the gorgeous ocean and terracotta colors. —Nena Farrell Casper's Hybrid Snow Pillow is our favorite pillow, period. It might not seem like it at first touch, but this pillow is super supportive for your head with its foam core and soft memory fiber surrounding it. Former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft found it to be his go-to pillow after testing tons of pillows for our guide. He says it's cooling, too, which is a nice bonus. He recommends catching it on sale, making now the ideal time to shop to get a little discount. —Nena Farrell This highly rated and reviewed body pillow on Amazon is my personal cheap pick for the Best Body Pillows for its relatively large size and comfiness. The plush fiber filling is soft enough that it can be contorted into many shapes and isn’t overstuffed, making it super easy to wrap your arms and legs around. The pillow refills back to shape without the filling getting bunched in one area or just going flat after a few weeks like some cheaper body pillows. I liked this super-soft pillow, and it’s a really great deal at a fraction of the price of other body pillows with comparable comfort. —Molly Higgins This large wall map is gorgeous. The world is shiny gold until countries and states are scratched off with a coin. It’s a great way to track your adventures, whether close to home or international. The colored areas of the map have nice details like major cities and topography, and while they’re appealing to look at, they’re also neutral enough that they’ll fit in with any decor.

It’s not perfect, but it’s quite adjustable, works for people of varying heights, and the high-density foam seat is cushy. You can lock the recline and adjust the lumbar support, and it helps that it’s also a very stylish office chair compared to its plain black competitors. For more discounts at Branch, read our separate story here. —Julian Chokkattu If your office chair budget is a little higher, then consider the Branch Verve. The main thing to note is that the arms are fixed—they can go up and down but not side to side. That’s my only real gripe with this chair; everything else is a nice upgrade over the Branch Ergonomic Chair, from build quality to back support. It also looks even more elegant, and there’s a headrest add-on if you want to shut your eyes and nap for a bit in between Zoom meetings. —Julian Chokkattu This chair is best suited for people under 5’9,” as it gave me back pain after several days in it (I’m 6’4”). After I asked a friend around 5’4” to try it, they liked it a lot and had no major qualms. It has a mesh back and a thick foam seat. Too bad it looks very, very dull. But maybe you want something nondescript! —Julian Chokkattu When it comes to writing, there’s nothing quite like the smooth 0.7 mm glide of the Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens. With 14 bold colors to choose from, this set is a rainbow of possibilities; whether you’re color-coding, writing in a planner, or doodling, their versatility and flair have earned them a permanent spot in our writing toolkit. —Boutayna Chokrane We love paper planners around here, and our favorite weekly planner is the Happy Planner. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found herself purchasing it year after year, and I can see why. It's got plenty of space for writing down plans and to-do lists, lots of fun covers, and a great price point. Score a planner for the new year (or a gift for your favorite planner person!) with Happy Planner's 30 percent off sale. —Nena Farrell It’s never too late to get organized and Class Tracker makes the best paper planners for students. There are monthly calendars, but the weekly pages shine. Each day sports a section for things to remember, tests, papers, or projects due, and larger spots for assignments and a daily plan. A Self-Care Corner gives you space for non-school things to focus on and a countdown box for something you're looking forward to. If you or the student in your life is struggling to get organized, this planner could help. —Simon Hill The Ryzen 9 7950X is one of AMD’s most powerful CPUs, and is on a steep discount. Anyone building a new PC or looking to upgrade theirs for raw computing power will want to check out this 16-core, 32-thread monster. The already ultra-fast 4.5GHz base clock can be pushed even higher with overclocking, making this an excellent choice for demanding workloads like video editing or 3D rendering. It’s also the perfect counterpart to a high-end GPU for the best possible experience in any video game. —Brad Bourque Logitech has a long history of great keyboards, and the MX Mechanical Mini is no exception. This wireless keyboard packs backlit keys, wired or wireless connectivity, and low-profile mechanical switches in your choice of tactile quiet, clicky, or linear. If you’ve got tons of devices, you should know the MX Mini also has wide support for operating systems and devices, including iOS. That makes this one of our favorite upgraded keyboards for tablet power users who want to unfold for a bit into a proper workstation. —Brad Bourque We recommended this Wi-Fi 6E system in our best mesh routers guide until it was replaced by the newer XE70 Pro, but this is still a good choice, especially with the discount. It is a tri-band (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) mesh with impressive range and stability. Each of the three routers has three Gigabit ports. By default, the 6-GHz band is reserved for wireless backhaul, but you can open it up for devices. If you have a connection of 1 Gbps or less, this mesh will serve you well. While enhanced security and parental controls require subscriptions, most folks can live without them. —Simon Hill Few USB webcams can match the Logitech C920 Pro’s quality, and at $50—half its usual price—it’s a bargain. With crisp 1080p and autofocus, it works great for video calls and streaming. Its white color balance is similar to the Razer webcam, and while the 78-degree field of view can be a bit tight, it just requires manual adjustments. It’s also missing a privacy shutter, but for a high-performing webcam, this is an unbeatable price. —Boutayna Chokrane The best Wi-Fi 6E router in our best routers guide, this hexagonal Asus router impressed in my tests. It’s a tri-band router, adding the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz. The new band is very fast, though it is relatively low range and doesn’t penetrate through walls very well. There’s ample connectivity with a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, a second 1-Gbps WAN/LAN, and a further three gigabit LANs. Asus also offers free security and parental controls and all the settings you need in the mobile app and browser interface, including band-splitting, prioritization for different activities, guest network, VPN support, and so on. —Simon Hill This affordable security camera is our pick of the best indoor security cameras because it offers clear 2K footage, with a starlight sensor that enables color night vision. Smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) is handy, and the slightly laggy two-way audio is fine. Pop in a microSD card (up to 512 GB) for local recording, or opt for a Tapo Care subscription for 30 days of cloud storage that starts at $3.50 per month. It also has an IP66 rating so it can be used outdoors. —Simon Hill This cute little indoor security camera is a cheaper version of our favorite model. It loses some features, like pet and vehicle detection, but TP-Link has reliable motion detection and customizable notifications. It's often on sale for around $20, but you can get it for extra cheap right now. —Nena Farrell Gamers don’t need a special gaming router, but if you love customizable RGB lighting, this mesh will tempt you. It’s not just fancy lighting that makes it worth a look, because this tri-band Asus ROG Rapture GT6 finished high up the table in most tests. With a single 2.4-GHz band and two 5-GHz bands (one is used for backhaul unless you connect the routers with an Ethernet cable), it can keep all your gaming gear online. The 5-GHz band supports wider 160-MHz channels and WPA3 for security. You also get AiProtection security software and comprehensive parental controls included without a subscription. The game modes boost performance and prioritize gaming traffic, and each router has a 2.5 Gbps WAN port, three 1 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port. —Simon Hill If you’re working in a hot environment, I highly suggest you get an all-mesh seat. These kinds of office chairs maximize airflow, allowing body heat to dissipate instead of trapping it. The Ergo3D has all the main points of adjustment you’d want and it’s a roomy chair. You even get two kinds of wheels in the box (casters or rollerblades) and you can insert whichever works best for your flooring. It’s not my favorite all-mesh chair, but it’s one of the few decent ones you’ll find south of $500. —Julian Chokkattu The SM57 is the most-used instrument mic in the history of recorded audio, by a large factor. It sounds great on guitar amps and beyond, and can be used to record essentially anything you need in a pinch. I’d stick to the extremely similar SM58 if you need a vocal mic, but if you need to record anything else, an SM57 is a must-have. —Parker Hall If you asked a child to draw a picture of a microphone, you’d get an image of the Shure SM58. This standard of stage and studio is so rugged you can use it as a hammer and it will still sound great after, though I don’t recommend you dent that iconic grille too soon. The dynamic microphone works great with any audio interface, and has a sound that you’ll be very familiar with if you’ve ever seen anyone sing live. —Parker Hall Shure’s SM7B microphone has been a studio staple for decades. While it’s gotten subtle improvements over the years, including an upgraded voice coil and a larger windscreen, it’s changed very little in its long tenure–you don’t mess with perfection. You’ll see this mic in multiple movies and TV shows (once you know it you can’t unsee it), as well as in real studios worldwide. It’s a killer option for podcasting and talk radio and works great as a vocal mic too. It’s designed to bring the best of your vocals to light, with little coloration so you just get the gritty goodness your unique voice provides. This is among the few standards I recommend first for any singer or creator, along with other favorites like the Electrovoice RE20, the do-it-all AKG C414, and the classic Shure SM58. —Ryan Waniata Every system needs a hard drive, and WD has been providing them for as long as I can remember. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but taking some dollars off this 1-TB internal drive might make it a more appealing second drive, or the main SSD in a budget-friendly system. With read speeds up to 560 MBps, you might not want to spend a ton of time transferring files on and off this drive, but it’s more than adequate enough for gaming and daily use, and priced well to boot. —Brad Bourque Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-looking Chromebook you can buy. The beautiful white design stands out in a sea of gray slabs. The Core i5 CPU offers plenty of performance to easily handle multiple tabs and app juggling. The webcam is nice too, much crisper than you’d expect for a $500 laptop. The downside is there's no backlit keyboard. —Scott Gilbertson The 13-inch Surface Laptop (7th Edition) (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor. Performance was good in our testing. It did not bog down no matter how many windows, tabs, and apps we threw at it. That said, this is not a machine for graphics-intensive tasks, like video editing or gaming (which is a shame because the vivid sharp screen with a 120-Hz screen refresh rate would be great for gaming). —Scott Gilbertson Dell's two larger XPS laptops (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are aimed at Windows users with MacBook jealousy. The design, specs, and sizes align perfectly with Apple's offerings. The XPS 14 has a gorgeous, sleek design (though it's thicker than a MacBook), a wonderfully bright and sharp OLED screen (with 120-Hz screen refresh rates), and is plenty speedy for everyday tasks. Unfortunately, heavy-duty tasks like video editing … well, the MacBook's benchmarks run circles around the XPS 14. Still, with this deal, this is a serious piece of hardware for not a lot of money. —Scott Gilbertson There's much to love about Samsung's Galaxy Book4 (7/10, WIRED Review), but let's be honest, that sticker price is insane. This deal brings it down somewhat, though it's still pricey. You do get impressive hardware—the new Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and current top-of-the-line processor in Intel’s Core Ultra CPU lineup, along with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card. The 16-inch AMOLED 2,880 x 1,800 pixels touchscreen is magnificent to work on and performance blew everything else we've tested out of the water. —Scott Gilbertson Who says you always have to buy the latest and greatest? If you get a tablet from Samsung’s 2023 Tab S9 series, you can save some serious cash and get an equally great experience (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Tab S9 is the smallest, and next comes the Tab S9+, both of which have AMOLED screens and are IP68-rated for water resistance. The Tab S9 Ultra is down to $800 ($400 off), and it’s massive and designed to be a travel-friendly computer when you don’t want to lug a laptop around. Also, check out the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Galaxy Tab FE+. If you just want a tablet to watch some shows, read, and play some games, these affordable slates are better than their predecessors, with smoother performance, and you still get a stylus in the box. They’re nearly identical—the FE+ just has more RAM and a bigger screen. —Julian Chokkattu The Galaxy Tab S10 series is the iPad Pro-equivalent of the Android world. The Tab S10+ has a reasonable 12.4-inch screen size, but the Tab S10 Ultra sports a massive 14.6-inch screen that is unwieldy to hold—you’ll want to pair it with a kickstand case. The Ultra is on sale for $1,000 ($200 off), but the Tab S10+ is much better value overall. You get the S Pen included for doodling and note-taking, the AMOLED screen is stunning, and it will receive 7 years of software updates. My primary issue is the price, and it’s still expensive at $850, but if you want the best tablet Android has to offer, this is it. —Julian Chokkattu You might think that giving your grandparents an older tablet might be fine, but things can get complicated fast if they’re not familiar with the software. Enter the GrandPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends). The company has been around for a decade and offers a custom tablet experience designed for seniors. That means larger touch targets, an easy-to-follow user interface, and LTE connectivity out of the box. There’s also 24/7 customer care and emergency 911 calling in case something happens. They won’t ever need to plug it in—just have them place it on the wireless charging dock and it’ll always be at the ready. The downside is this all involves a pricey subscription plan. If you buy directly from GrandPad, you get $100 off the annual subscription, but if you buy directly from Amazon, you get $100 off the tablet itself. You can’t use the tablet without a subscription. —Julian Chokkattu Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Bose’s Smart Soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite mini bar, even if it’s on the pricier side for a small bar that doesn’t come with a dedicated subwoofer. That means you’re sacrificing some punch down low, but in its place you’re getting fantastic immersion thanks to true upfiring drivers (something the Sonos Beam doesn’t have), Wi-Fi streaming and networking, and some innovative audio features. Those include a new AI dialog mode that brings forth voices and center-channel information with remarkable clarity. You can also now use the brand’s Open Earbuds as clip-on personal surround speakers. The Bose app is simple and intuitive, and lets you easily add other speakers like a Bose Bass module down the line. —Ryan Waniata Every TV deserves better sound, and this cheap soundbar and wireless subwoofer from Yamaha is a great way to get it. It’s super easy to set up with a simple HDMI eARC connection, and it brings a shocking amount of depth to content you probably watched through tinny TV speakers. Its little brother, the SR-C20A, has been our best soundbar for most of the year, and this brings more bass at a now-discounted price. —Parker Hall Sonos’ indomitable Arc (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has new competition from within courtesy of the Arc Ultra, which offers subtle but impactful sonic improvements and the ability to connect over 5GHz Wi-Fi. At $1,000, though, it’s not the best fit for all budgets. The regular Arc is still a winner, providing full and warm sound, excellent detail for dialog and music, and impressive immersion for surround sound and Dolby Atmos soundtracks via side- and up-firing drivers. Like other Sonos gear, you can add surround speakers or the new Sub 4 subwoofer, or connect with other speakers for all the multi-room audio tricks upon which Sonos made its name. You’ll also get built-in microphones for smart home control. Though Sonos’ app has had its struggles lately, it seems to be on more solid ground. If you’ve been waiting on a potent standalone bar with room for larger aspirations, this Arc deal is worth grabbing. —Ryan Waniata Klipsch’s Flexus Core 200 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) sounds bigger and brawnier than you’d expect for the money, pushing toward bars that cost twice as much. Its MDF construction (in place of plastic) offers deep and musical resonance, and its upfiring drives expand the sound to accentuate Dolby Atmos films and TV shows to cinematic heights (literally). Dialog is also clear and present thanks to a dedicated center channel. The trade-off is that there’s no Wi-Fi support as you’d expect for this price, but the bar is not without its innovative extras. As the name implies, the system provides flexible expansion with available surround speakers and a thumpy subwoofer. This bar is one of the best soundbars around for those who put sound quality first at full price, and a true bargain on sale. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals It’s hard to think of a more stalwart consumer electronics product over the last decade than Sony’s WH-1000XM4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Even four years after their debut, they serve as a benchmark for new contenders and premium offerings from top players alike. Their noise canceling isn’t top tier, but it’s still very good, and a raft of features—from a multi-band EQ to a touch control that turns on transparency mode temporarily for announcements or quick conversations—makes them feel advanced even as they gracefully age. Their sound is warm and bassy, yet refreshingly refined, and their durable plastic shells harbor plush padding for hours of comfort. You can outdo these noise cancelers with the latest Bose QuietComfort Ultra or Sony’s step-up WH-1000XM5, but there’s no question as to why Sony’s kept them around for multiple generations. —Ryan Waniata Technics isn’t the first name you think of for wireless earbuds, but the EAH-AZ80 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are among the best earbuds out there for their mix of a snug and comfy fit, great features, solid noise canceling, and sterling sound. The flashy gleam of their endcaps seems to tease their sound signature, which is slick, clear, and deeply textural to bring instruments to life. The AZ80’s noise canceling doesn’t catch Bose or even Sony’s top buds, but it’s good enough, and multipoint pairing with three different devices at once makes these buds uniquely versatile. This is a great pair at a good price, making them worth grabbing for those who put fit and sound quality first. Only the silver come in at the lowest price, but other colors are also steeply discounted. —Ryan Waniata Soundpeats has a knack for making affordable earbuds with exceptionally good sound. In fact, we recently gave their latest pair that uses a new kind of driver, the Soundcapsule 3+, a perfect 10/10. The Air4 Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are not that pair, but they serve up clear and balanced sound along with solid noise canceling for a very low asking price. They don’t have the spoils you’ll get in flagships like the AirPods Pro (even if they look a lot like them), but for well below $100 they’re a worthy option that could make a great gift for the budding music lover in your life. —Ryan Waniata Need a cheap pair of earbuds to not think too much about? Look no further than the Go Air Pop, which are utterly usable earbuds that cost less than $20. I like keeping a pair in my car or gym bag for when I forget to bring nicer buds with me and still want music. —Parker Hall I didn’t set out to love the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds (7/10, WIRED recommends). Even on sale, they’re pricey for such a limited use case, but damn if they haven’t become my favorite open earbuds on the market. Their curlicue barrel design takes some getting used to, but they roll onto your ears with impressive tenacity, staying put without pinching tight. Once in place, the little sound beams from their snake-like acoustic housings offer the most well-rounded performance I’ve heard in the genre. Like other open-ear models, you won’t get noise canceling or isolation so the sound is always blended with the world around you, but it’s a fantastic trick for working out or staying aware in any number of situations. These aren’t the best earbuds for every scenario, but if you can spend up for a targeted pair of standby buds alongside your best noise-canceling buds, you may just fall for them too. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra headphones (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are premium in style and performance, as you’d expect from the best noise-canceling headphones on the market. Their plush and ergonomic design makes them a joy to wear, while their penchant for noise-strangling makes them the ultimate choice for serious travelers or those who simply need unparalleled tranquility in their home or office. I also really enjoy the sound, which is less forward than Bose flagships past, while still providing excellent instrumental separation and deft balance. The battery provides a solid 30 hours per charge and the headphones add futuristic features like 3D audio virtualization with head-tracking to feel more like a pair of speakers. At well over $400, these are a serious splurge, but at this price they feel more like a steal. —Ryan Waniata The Jabra Elite series have been our top pick in our guide to workout headphones for years. Unfortunately, the company recently decided to stop making them. Although the earbuds have an unusually long two-year warranty, some of my colleagues would counsel you not to pick them. However, these are still the most comfortable and secure workout headphones that I’ve tried. They have an unusual feature, which is that you can plug the case into a 3.5-mm headphone jack to listen to them on a plane. It’s neat! These are still great for travel! —Adrienne So Jabra’s Elite 4 Active (9/10, WIRED Recommends) were almost shockingly good upon release a couple of years back, and they’re still an excellent buy today–especially on sale. As part of Jabra’s sporty overhaul, they blend serious durability with a comfy fit, smooth and balanced sound, and plenty of ways to personalize the experience in the Jabra app. They even provide a slab of noise canceling, though it’s more of an aid to their noise-isolating fit. They’re also dust and water-resistant, meaning you can dunk them or rinse them after a sweaty workout with no ill effects. Jabra has called it quits on consumer earbuds, but the stalwart brand pledges to support its current products through its warranty, so there’s no reason to hesitate. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take nearly everything we loved about the previous model a step further, offering a mix of fabulous features and excellent noise canceling, comfort, and sound quality. These headphones have everything, from multipoint pairing and auto-pause sensors to brilliant touch commands and Amazon Alexa support. They’re perfect for travel, but just as handy for wearing around the house. They’re not quite as packable as the previous model, the XM4, but that’s really the only flaw in an otherwise near-perfect package. —Ryan Waniata These bone-conduction headphones are the option you’re probably most likely to see in the wild. They use your jaw bones to route sound to your ears, which means you can hear everything around. This version is smaller than the newer second generation, which makes them better for folks with smaller heads (there is also a mini version on sale). —Parker Hall Jabra may be getting out of the earbud game, but the Elite 5 are still excellent earbuds that should last for many years of solid use. They’re comfortable and durable (IP55 rated), and the hybrid noise cancellation makes them great on flights or calls. Sound quality is excellent, with bold bass and enough midrange that you can hear every detail of the guitar or piano. —Parker Hall These are some of our favorite gifts for new parents, though anyone who experiences overstimulation might benefit from them. They’re designed for concerts to slightly reduce noise while still letting you hear. That makes them perfect for parents who need a little break from sleep training or the soundtrack of the Terrible Twos. You’ll still hear your kiddo, but you’ll be able to focus on their needs instead of that otherworldly screeching that can only be produced by a colicky newborn. —Louryn Strampe Denon’s PerL earbuds (7/10, WIRED Reviewed) don’t fit or feel quite like traditional earbuds, but their sound is seriously impressive thanks to the most advanced personalization system I’ve tested in the genre. These buds tune to your hearing profile, which for me equated to richer, fuller, and more intimate sound across my catalog. The profile they create may take some time to lock in, but once you do, it’s an impressive ride. I wasn’t convinced with the overall execution at $200, but at half the price, this is a killer deal for serious listeners. —Ryan Waniata The fully tweakable noise canceling inside these reflective workout earbuds makes them great for folks who like to be aware of their surroundings when outdoors but enjoy a bit of silence when inside. They have excellent sound quality and call quality and work as intended, allowing you to adjust how much of the outside world you want to hear at any given moment with easy-to-use touch controls. —Parker Hall Kids are extremely susceptible to hearing loss, which is why WIRED staffers who are parents love headphones like these that limit output to the OSHA-recommended 85 decibels. The noise canceling is excellent and will help with louder noises on flights or from HVAC, and these also come in either pink or blue, so you can get whichever color your kiddo prefers. —Parker Hall Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The WIRED Gear team battles over who gets to review each generation of this adorable Bluetooth speaker, because it’s just so handy. A tiny little rubber strap lets you attach it to everything from handlebars to backpacks. It sounds shockingly good for its size, too, and a rugged IP67 rating means you don’t need to worry if it takes a spill. —Parker Hall Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite speakers, and the Boom series is a standout. An update of the relatively ancient Boom 3, the Boom 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) brings long-awaited USB-C charging and modestly redesigned drivers. Its performance offers the same clear, smooth, and balanced presentation we’ve come to expect from the series. You’ll also get up to 15 hours of battery life, the ability to stereo pair with another Boom 4, and plenty of ways to adjust the sound in the app. This isn’t the bassiest speaker for its size, but its sound is more refined than cheaper knock-offs. Its primary drawback is its high price, which makes now the right time to strike. —Ryan Waniata Marshall’s pivot to rock-inspired Bluetooth speakers has been very successful from a product standpoint. These robust speakers feature great design and even better sound, plus I like that they have a strap that makes them easy to carry with other items when you’re packing in to a campsite. Twenty hours of playtime and 20 watts of output means you’ll be jamming loud and for a while, and an IPX4 rating means this is fine in the rain. —Parker Hall The best Bluetooth speakers offer a mix of durability, sound quality, and aesthetics, which is exactly how I’d describe this mid-tier model from Ultimate Ears. The folks who design these spend a lot of time testing their limits, from drop tests to bleach testing them in the desert sun, and that makes them great for folks who tend to be harder on consumer electronics. If you have a fisherman, hunter, or contractor in your life, UE is the brand for you. —Parker Hall Round Bluetooth speakers like this one might seem hard to place, but the built-in leather strap that comes with the Beosound A1 makes it very easy to hang anywhere you might need to. It’s a very well-made speaker, with a sleek metal exterior that can survive a heck of a lot of abuse. The normal downside is the price, which is negated by this deal. —Parker Hall JBL’s Authentics 200 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) speaks fluent Google and Alexa, letting you pick your smart home poison. That means it can act as a controller for multiple types of smart home products without the need for unifying smart protocols like Matter. The speaker’s stylish retro design provides further appeal, with a chunky foam grille reminiscent of JBL’s ’70s audiophile designs and real knobs for EQ and volume. Most important, the Authentics sounds fantastic, with warm and vibey mids, crisp treble, and wavy bass you can feel through the floor when it gets humming. Sonos models like the Era 100 and Era 300 are top of mind for most seeking an acoustically sound Wi-Fi speaker, but don’t sleep on the 200, especially at this new low price. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s newest Soundlink speaker is also its most expensive, but this sale makes its potent sound and size a lot more approachable. In his review, WIRED contributor Siman Lucas called the Max’s sound “as big, bold, and…upfront as it looks,” touting its penchant for refined bass and uncommon care for the rest of the frequency spectrum. That’s a great mix for a bass-forward model. It also proffers extras like 20 hours of battery life, IP67 weatherproofing, and a slick, travel-friendly design, making it among the very best Bluetooth speakers of its kind. —Ryan Waniata The only real downside to JBL’s best Bluetooth speakers is their high price. Grabbing them on a good sale is key, which makes this Clip 5 deal a top target. The perfect shower speaker does much more than just belt out your morning tunes. Its titular clip makes it easy to bring camping, attach it to your bike, or even clip it on your belt buckle as you clean up your yard or take the dog for a spin. The sound is full and surprisingly warm, with good detail and more bass than most pint-size rivals. Other features include 12 hours of battery (or 15 hours with the battery saver mode) and JBL’s handy app for adjusting the sound or connecting with other JBL models. —Ryan Waniata I loved the new Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) at full price, and at $100 or less it’s arguably the best value for a bass-thumping portable out there. The speaker matches musical low-end poise with swift instrumental attacks and vivid high-register detail. At times it pushes toward sharpness, but mainly stays free to provide an exhilarating sound signature with plenty of punch. It adds loads of features, including high-res audio support via USB-C input, one-touch pairing for Android or iOS, and 24 hours of battery life per charge, to make it among the best you can buy. It’s all encapsulated (sorry) in a premium design with IP67 weather protection for outdoor adventures. —Ryan Waniata I tested the R81+ of this Fluance for our Best Turntables guide, which adds a slightly upgraded cartridge and a platter with a more advanced dampener. Still, I would not hesitate to recommend this version, especially at just over $200. The R81’s best features are its solid build quality including a lift-lower mechanism that seems far too good for a turntable at this price. —Martin Cizmar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Fellow Aiden (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the most talked about coffee devices this year. It’s a sleek update on the classic Mr. Coffee from the 1970s: A drip machine to make drip coffee seem kinda cool again. It’s easy to use, it can be customized to each roast or bean with a simple dial twirl, and our reviewer marveled at how good the coffee was. The device is on sale but only if you also buy a bean grinder. Luckily, the Fellow Opus is also the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall grinder in existence. —Matthew Korfhage The Breville Barista Express is the lowest priced all-in-one espresso maker and frother we’ve found that’ll compete with the thousand-dollar big boys—a sturdy machine with precision, power, grace, and staying power. This is a longtime Gear team favorite: WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu has kept this on his counter for a half-decade. The slightly upgraded Pro version is also on sale this weekend, for about hundred more. —Matthew Korfhage The grinder on this surprisingly svelte KitchenAid machine (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is quite literally the quietest we’ve tested or measured, a whisper of a device that might not wake your significant other or your roommate when you desperately need a 6 am shot. The machine is thoughtfully and intuitively put together, but coffee dosing can be a bit finicky at first: Our Gear team testers noted it might take a few tries before you get it dialed just right. —Matthew Korfhage The Terra Kaffe is a pricey hunk of coffee machinery and has its bugs, but it’s one of few on earth to offer not just quality espresso and macchiato, but also true drip coffee that’s not Americano in disguise. This all arrives in a nifty, easy-to-clean package with a smart screen and all the trimmings. Using a phone app, you can begin warming the machine up from your bed, just like a remote starter on your car. Anyway, it’s a whopping $600 off, with an extra hundo off the top if you sign on for a coffee subscription. —Matthew Korfhage This is the best bean grinder we’ve found under $100, hands down. At the moment, it costs even less than that. At 16 inches high, the Oxo is a little tall to fit under a kitchen cabinet. But it’s durable, and it’s got a slim profile and a truly surprising ability to dial down to fine espresso grinds. —Matthew Korfhage The pricier Fellow or Baratza grinders likely win on overall execution. But what our Gear team testers prized greatly in KitchenAid’s burr grinder was its beauteous ease of cleaning, with burrs accessibly placed just beneath the hopper. Over the life of the product, this can matter more than you expect. We also liked the precise dose control and the helpful guidelines on grind settings. The universal merit of KitchenAid devices kind of tends to just be that they’re considerate of their users: “user-friendly,” to coin a term. Anyway, this is the lowest price we’ve seen on this model. —Matthew Korfhage The Cafe Barista was already our budget pick among fully automated cafe and espresso machines, and right now it’s on significant discount. If you don’t mind the plasticky casing, this low-cost device will make you a rich single or double espresso with a single push of the button, not to mention lattes and cappuccinos. —Matthew Korfhage This is what I use when I make cold brew at home. It’s an elegant, slim-profiled, no-fuss update to the classic Toddy device your favorite cafe probably uses to make a $5 cup of cold brew. Spoon in coffee, pour water over the nifty “rainmaker” top, then let it all sit for 16 to 24 hours. Filtering is as easy as sticking the immersion chamber atop the carafe. It takes patience, but not effort. And the resulting cold brew is delicious. —Matthew Korfhage Do you have a coffee lover on your gift list? Trade coffee is our favorite option for those who want variety, and this deal can get variety delivered to your loved one's door for less. Trade Coffee doesn't roast coffee. Instead, it acts as a middleman between small roasters around the country and you. Trade Coffee makes it possible to get specialty coffee beans from boutique roasters around the US without going on an epic road trip (though that would be a great road trip, so if you have the time, go for it, and send a postcard). —Scott Gilbertson Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) is truly tiny yet powerful. It’s the Alexa smart speaker I find myself always having set up somewhere in my house, even if I’m testing other voice assistants. This smart speaker might only be a few inches tall, but its audio quality can almost rival the larger Echos. The small footprint makes it easy to add almost anywhere in your home, too. The only downside is the price for such a small speaker, but this sale fixes that. —Nena Farrell If you want a smart display, this is the Goldilocks of the lot. The Echo Show 8 is the perfect size with its 8-inch screen to use for all kinds of features—smart home control, music player, video calls, even a little movie streaming—and packs a great speaker, a smart home hub, and a 13 MP camera. Use it as a digital photo frame, a smart home control center, or just a music jam session. Not only is this smart display fantastic, but it's nearly half off right now and available for the best price we've seen all year. —Nena Farrell The Echo Pop (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the cheapest Amazon Echo speaker on a normal day, and it's the only one you'll find for under $20. It's downright adorable, with a half-moon shape and a couple of fun colors you won't find in other Amazon speakers. It's not the most impressive speaker—no surprise with the smaller form factor it has—but it's not bad for the price, plus you'll get all the usual features of a smart speaker in it. —Nena Farrell Amazon's lineup of smart speakers is huge, but it all started with the true Amazon Echo. The fourth-gen model has an orb shape, rather than the tower of the first few models. But the updated shape also comes with fuller sound that can better fill a room and a built-in smart home hub that can connect to your devices directly over Matter or Zigbee. It's a great speaker and smart assistant, and the twilight blue color is on sale for half off. You can also find the black and white colors on sale for $5 more. —Nena Farrell If you want something just to control your smart home and answer your questions, nothing more, then the Amazon Echo Hub (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. This Amazon Echo speaker is designed to be wall-mounted, and looks like a smart home panel a custom designer would put into your home. Instead of needing your own designer and electricians to set this up, you'll just need your Alexa app and devices that work with it. The Echo Hub isn't meant for any other tricks; it has a speaker, but it's intentionally mediocre, and you'll be prompted to choose a different Amazon Echo in your home to be the primary sound device if you use the Hub for music. It's meant to be a companion to the rest of your existing smart home ecosystem, and as someone who primarily controls her smart home with her speakers, I love it. —Nena Farrell Not to quote my own review, but the Amazon Echo Spot (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is small yet surprisingly helpful. This second-gen model is back after being discontinued, with an updated look that matches the vibe of the Echo Pop that launched last summer (that's on sale too!). I was surprised how much I liked it—it takes my favorite quick-glance smart display features, shows me the weather and my calendar when I ask, and leaves out all of the clutter. It's a solid speaker for casual listening, though the Echo Dot is still the best of the pint-sized Amazon speakers. It's ideal for a bedside table, but I also like it for my desk. It's on sale for almost half off, so it's a great time to get one if you want it. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Canopy is our overall favorite among the suddenly ubiquitous filtered showerheads that now promise to remove all sorts of things from your water, presumably keeping your hair and skin more lustrous. Unlike many such filters, we discovered during testing that the Canopy does in fact remove troublesome chlorine compounds before its spray hits your hair and skin. It's also a good-looking showerhead with multiple spray settings and a lot of considerate touches that make it easy to use. Note that filters require replacement every three months or so, at $25-$35 a pop. —Matthew Korfhage I go through a lot of heat protectants while testing hair straighteners for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, and R+Co Bleu’s Hypersonic Heat Styling Mist is one of my go-to. It protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (also great for hair dryers and curling irons) and goes on kind of thick, like hairspray, so it’s definitely effective at fighting frizz but also isn’t so heavy that it weighs hair down. It also comes in sustainable packaging and is Leaping Bunny certified to be cruelty-free. All of R+Co’s products are 30 percent off, so R+Co’s diatomaceous earth-based Skyline Dry Shampoo is also worth a grab if you need a TSA-compliant dry shampoo for travel or are trying to stay away from aerosols. On the subject of hair products, IGK is also offering 30 percent off everything on its site. While testing for an upcoming guide to the Best Heat Protectants we’ve also become quite fond of IGK’s Good Behavior Smoothing Spray (protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit), which is $10 off in the sale. —Kat Merck This was a past budget pick in our electric toothbrush guide, and it’s still a great, affordable toothbrush. It’s cute, thin, and has a gentle cleaning vibration as a sonic toothbrush. It comes with a carrying case, too. —Nena Farrell Sonic toothbrushes are a little gentler than your standard oscillating toothbrush, and the Philips 4100 Sonicare is our favorite sonic toothbrush we’ve tried. We already like the 4100 for all the features it packs at its price point—two intensity levels, a pressure sensor, and a two-minute timer—and those features are an even better deal right now while this toothbrush is on sale. —Nena Farrell The Series 9 is Braun’s ”professional-grade” beard trimmer for the home set, with a quick and secure front control dial to change cut length, long battery life, and an excellent-quality main clipper attachment. Other attachments of equal quality allow tight detail work, or ruler-straight lines and edgework. It is, in short, our favorite overall beard trimmer—and it’s handsomely on sale. —Matthew Korfhage If you love the idea of a multi-tool system like the Dyson AirWrap but can’t stomach shelling out $600, the Shark FlexStyle (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. Like the AirWrap, there are two sets, one for “straight and wavy” and one for “curly and coily,” and both come with two brushes for drying and two barrels for curling. The wand bends at the middle to become a hair dryer that can be used alone or in concert with one of the brush attachments, and it even has one more heat setting than the Dyson—all for literally half the price. WIRED contributor Alanna Martine Kilkeary declared it the Best Multitasking Curler, while former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano deemed it a “near-perfect dupe” of the AirWrap. —Kat Merck Some people (like me) have stubborn hair that will only straighten with a flat iron, but others with more forgiving hair have a wider breadth of options, from hot brushes to air-assisted tools like Dyson’s AirWrap (8/10 WIRED Recommends). Yet another method is via the Tymo Ring, a straightening comb that former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano called in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners a way to take “the curl right out quickly—I didn't have to go over sections more than once or twice.” She also liked the outer shell that covers the hot teeth, so users are able to get closer to their roots without burning themselves. —Kat Merck As detailed in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this OG Chi is an oldie but a goodie—even though it’s got ceramic plates and only heats up to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s able to successfully smooth a broad range of hair types and textures. It’s lightweight, with 1-inch plates for easy maneuverability and waves, plus it’s got three heat settings and one-hour auto-shutoff for safety. I had one of these straighteners decades ago and it lasted nearly 10 years. Even though this isn’t the greatest sale I’ve ever seen, I still wouldn’t hesitate to buy it again. —Kat Merck This mascara has been my holy grail for years. There are a few drugstore dupes that come close, but in my opinion, nothing beats the real thing. It makes my lashes look long, thick, and velvety in just one coat, and in two coats I might as well be wearing falsies. I also appreciate just how deep and dark the black color is. If you want the most dramatic lashes of your life, this is the way. —Louryn Strampe If you’re looking for an alternative to a blow-dryer brush, the GHD Duet Style is a blow-dryer and flat iron combo that former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber thought worked just as well as the Dyson Airstrait (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Hot air vents through the device’s plates dry hair as it straightens for less damage overall, according to GHD. In our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, Victoria said she especially liked that the Shine Shot Mode could turn off the air and convert it to a traditional hair straightener. —Kat Merck I'm obsessed with blow-dry brushes. The Dyson got me hooked, but I've been pretty darn impressed with the T3 AireBrush on my post-shower hair. I've tried both the round and oval versions, and while I prefer the smaller round option for my chin-length bob, the oval works fantastic too for longer hair or if you like the blowout shape you’d get using a regular hairbrush. Either one is a great purchase, and both are 30 percent off for T3's sale. —Nena Farrell If you know, you know. Aquaphor is like magic. I use it on cracked cuticles, chapped lips, healing tattoos, dry knees, and even on my eyelids when I’m doing a glossy makeup look. This set comes with a travel-friendly 1.7-ounce tube as well as a giant 14-ounce tub. It should be enough to last you through this winter and next, and if you buy it frequently, this is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe With winter around the corner, your lips might start to feel more chapped than usual. This lip mask will help with that. The thick texture melts quickly and sinks straight into your dry skin, leaving your lips feeling less cracked. It also lasts long enough throughout the day that you won't have to constantly reapply the product—so the jar, while small, should last you for a while. —Brenda Stolyar Manscaped is best known for its viral below-the-belt Lawn Mower model. But above the neck, Manscaped’s Beard Hedger has its merits. Specifically, it sports a waterproof body, it’s great for a stubble trim, and its USB-C charger means you can charge it from your phone adapter or laptop. While the Hedger’s design may not be as elegant as some, this all adds up to make it a great travel device. —Matthew Korfhage Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This might just be the most incredible value of 2024. The Moto G Power 5G already impressed me (8/10, WIRED Recommends) earlier this year with its solid performance and 120-Hz LCD screen, not to mention the support for NFC to make contactless payments and even wireless charging. At this $200 discount, it’s a shockingly good Android phone, though its biggest flaw is that it will only receive an update to Android 15, and that’s it. You’ll still get two more years of security updates though. —Julian Chokkattu Flip phones are all the rage. These folding phones work like normal smartphones, but you can fold them in half to stow them in a pocket or purse. What’s not to love? Well, battery life isn’t great (you can just barely eke out a day with average use), but they’re cute and fun, plus Samsung’s build quality is exceptional (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Galaxy Z Flip6’s external screen isn’t as useful as the cover screen on Motorola’s Razr+, but this is still a well-built flip phone at a reasonable price. —Julian Chokkattu Want a booklike folding phone? My top pick is the Google Pixel 9 Pro, but Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Fold6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is even cheaper! It has excellent build quality (Samsung has been doing this for six years after all), and the external display is wider than before, making it nicer to use. The cameras are great and the screens are bright, though it doesn’t open up to as large a screen as the Pixel. —Julian Chokkattu If, like me, you've been chasing the feeling of using your Blackberry Curve for over a decade now, then I have the accessory for you. It's called the Clicks Keyboard case (8/10, WIRED Recommends) and it's the first-of-its-kind iPhone case with a built-in keyboard. It's a great option for someone who relies on their phone for tasks like sending off emails, typing up documents, responding to Slack messages, and more. It'll take a while to get used to the tactile keys though—days or weeks depending on how quickly you build up muscle memory. We also only recommend it for the iPhone 16 lineup. It comes with a redesigned keyboard, a slightly more durable design, and support for MagSafe and CarPlay. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the latest model to join Apple's lineup. It also holds the top spot in our guide to the Best Apple Watches. Compared to its predecessor, it not only has a bigger display, but it's also thinner, lighter, and packs support for fast charging. The smartwatch also runs WatchOS 11, so you'll have access to features like Vitals (to check your baseline every morning) and Training Load (to see how your workouts are impacting your fitness over time). It's worth noting that it doesn't pack a blood oxygen sensor, though. —Brenda Stolyar The Ultra 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our top pick for outdoor sports. Under the hood is an S9 chip for faster performance and an ultra-wideband chip with enhanced precision finding. You'll also have access to dual-frequency GPS, offline maps (that you'll have to download to your iPhone), and Backtrack for creating virtual breadcrumb trails on the Compass app via the Action button. —Brenda Stolyar The best running watch will probably always be a Garmin Forerunner. The line ranges from the barebones Forerunner 55 to the spendy Forerunner 965 for triathlons, but I think the Forerunner 165 has pretty much everything you need. The more you spend, the more sensors you get, and the Forerunner 165 has blood oxygen sensing plus a barometric altimeter, compass, and ambient light sensor, in addition to the now-standard fall detection and multiple satellite positioning systems. —Adrienne So Yes, the price is lower now that the new Oura Ring 4 has been released. But I wore the Oura Ring Gen3 for many years and found it to be accurate, attractive, and comfortable (once all the features it had promised in 2021 became available). Some days, I even find myself missing the three little bump optical sensors on the back of my ring. This is a pretty remarkable deal for a one-of-a-kind fitness tracker that started a whole product category all by itself. —Adrienne So There are a few pretty great Fitbit deals going on right now, but if you have kids, I suggest going for the Fitbit Ace LTE. Unlike the Apple Watch, it’s not phone-specific, so your kid can use it even if you and your spouse are an Android/iPhone family (if so, why?). It has a ton of fun, movement-based games that are an incentive for your kid to actually remember to charge your watch and keep it on. I understand that feelings are mixed on giving kids smart devices, but it helps us all keep track of each other as my kids walk around the neighborhood and it stops me from having to text everyone else’s parents all the time. —Adrienne So Samsung tried to make a squircle-shaped Apple Watch Ultra competitor and it’s … OK (7/10, WIRED Review). The company also targeted Apple-like pricing, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra didn’t have complete feature parity and its software isn’t as polished. Still, this is a powerful smartwatch with a few extra features over the company’s standard Galaxy Watch7, and it’s much more reasonably priced with this discount, which ends on December 1. —Julian Chokkattu The latest iteration of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch series has some artificial intelligence algorithms to improve your health tracking data, like giving you a comprehensive Energy Score and updated sleep tracking abilities. It can also detect if you have sleep apnea. However, editor Julian Chokkattu found battery life frustrating compared to older models, and it’s worth noting you won’t get the full functionality unless you pair it with a Samsung phone. —Adrienne So The OnePlus Watch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) had one job: stand out from other Wear OS smartwatches, and it succeeded. Unlike Samsung’s Galaxy Watch7 or Google’s Pixel Watch 3, OnePlus prioritized battery life over all else, and thanks to a clever dual-processor and dual-operating system hybrid architecture, the Watch 2 can last roughly three days on a single charge. Hooray! The health tracking isn’t its strong suit, but this is a Wear OS smartwatch so you’ll find many rich smart features, though it’s only compatible with Android phones. You can save even more by going with the OnePlus Watch 2R for $170 ($60 off), which has a screen that doesn’t get as bright, no sapphire crystal coating over the glass, and an aluminum build over stainless steel. —Julian Chokkattu This is still the watch that I would wear if I didn’t have to test other fitness trackers—and I’m not the only one, because Garmin’s Instinct line is one of the company’s most popular. It has all the backcountry capabilities of the higher-end Fenix and Epix lines, but it’s more affordable because it ditches the fancy screen. The Instinct 2 Solar’s battery life lasted almost three weeks when I tested it in Hawaii, where I used it to keep track of everything from trail runs to keeping me oriented toward the beach when snorkeling. —Adrienne So The Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our guide to the best fitness trackers thanks to the perfect balance of attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, and ease of use. Google’s takeover has led to several smart integrations with Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music Premium. This tracker can keep tabs on your skin temperature, 24/7 heart rate, activities, and sleep schedule. You can also expect week-long battery life, but the best features still require the $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription. —Simon Hill Garmin recently combined its two high-end Epix and Fenix lines in the updated Fenix 8 series, which we will be including in our Best Fitness Trackers roundup. However, if you have no particular need for voice commands or new, leakproof buttons for scuba, the second-gen Epix Pro is still a great buy, and it’s now much cheaper! Use the beautiful AMOLED screen to access Garmin’s detailed proprietary maps. And I’m a little embarrassed by how much I like the onboard flashlight. —Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This isn't technically a deal, but retailers are currently offering Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta Quest+, its game subscription program, through April 2025. If you've never tried a VR headset and you're curious, this is one of the best and easiest ways to start playing loads of games to see if you like it. We also think the Quest 3S is one of the cheapest and lightest ways to get into gaming (it will still make you slightly nauseous if you're not used to it, though.) —Adrienne So This is our top gaming headset recommendation because it uses Logitech’s Lightspeed connection system (with a 2.4-GHz dongle) for low-latency audio (important when playing fast-paced games). You can also use Bluetooth if you’d like, or jack in with the 3.5-mm headphone jack. That makes it more versatile than ever. The boom mic arm is detachable so you can wear this out of the house without feeling like you’re headed to a call center. Our previous top pick was the G Pro X 2’s predecessor, and it’s also on sale for $81 ($19 off). But that one’s a wired headset so you have fewer connectivity options. —Julian Chokkattu As the younger sibling to the impressive HyperX Cloud Alpha, these boast an incredible 120 hours of claimed battery life, in some cases four times its competitors. That truly astounding number is backed up by crisp sound quality and a high level of compatibility. The included USB-C dongle and USB-A adapter let you plug them into almost any system you can find, so nothing will stand between you and your games, particularly having to recharge. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation VR2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best VR headsets, featuring a comfortable, adjustable headband, excellent eye-tracking that allows you to select menu items or track objects by looking at them, and it comes with two controllers. If you crave immersion, you’ll find it here. The headset requires a PS5 and this is a tasty discount, but we recommend going for the PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of The Mountain Bundle ($349) since it is the same price and includes one of the best PS VR2 games in Horizon Call of the Mountain. —Simon Hill Our favorite gaming headset for multi-platform gamers, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X supports almost every modern system under the sun, including the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and basically anything else with a USB-C port or Bluetooth. It’s also super comfortable for long gaming sessions, with plush ear cups and the classic SteelSeries support band. At just $100, these very well might be your favorite new pair of wireless gaming headphones. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation 5 Slim is a slimmed-down version of the PlayStation 5 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) that’s around 30 percent slimmer. It runs the same list of great PS5 games but takes up less space beneath the TV. We have a breakdown of the different PlayStation 5 models if you want to dive deeper, but the PS5 Slim is the only one on sale and a 15 percent discount is decent if you’re in the market for a Sony console. —Simon Hill Even at its full price of $40, the Logitech G203 feels like a solid deal, but for half that, it’s a downright steal. It has six programmable buttons, full support for the Logitech G Hub software, and RGB lighting—what else could you ask for? The only real compromise here is the 8,000 DPI max, but as long as you can live with that, this is a great budget-friendly gaming mouse or a perfect backup mouse for traveling or emergencies. —Brad Bourque Compact gaming keyboards like the Razer Huntsman Mini make a lot of sense for gamers with limited desk space. As long as you can live without a num pad or arrow keys, you’ll find all the features you’d expect from a full size offering in this compact keyboard. That includes Razer’s excellent software support, keycap compatibility, and excellent build quality. All that adds up to a big deal on a small board, and it’s just part of the reason the Razer Huntsman Mini is our favorite small keyboard. —Brad Bourque With a million mechanical keyboards on the market, it can be tough to stand out, but the Corsair K100 does just that with its built-in control wheel. This programmable knob can adjust keyboard lighting or other built-in keyboard functions, but more fun is the option to set it to control media playback on your system. You’ll also get RGB backlighting, a volume control wheel, and a set of macro keys along the left side, all features we’d expect from a mechanical keyboard at this price point. —Brad Bourque The Steam Deck might be all about portable handheld gaming, but sometimes you just wanna plug it into a bigger screen, just like a Nintendo Switch, especially if you want to play a game with a keyboard and mouse. This aluminum Jsaux 7-in-1 Steam Deck Dock will do the job, with three USB-A ports, a DisplayPort, an HDMI, a USB-C, and even an Ethernet port. —Julian Chokkattu I didn’t think I’d love Disney Dreamlight Valley when I first installed it, but it quickly became one of my favorite cozy games. It’s fantastic on the Nintendo Switch but available for other consoles. It’s a life sim where you’ll run around collecting items, farming crops, fishing, and decorating, but it also has a surprisingly grown-up storyline that might entice even those of us who don’t have fond memories of Disney movies or shows. The Cozy Edition comes with bonus cosmetics that you don’t get with the base game. Pro tip: Plant all the pumpkins. —Louryn Strampe It’s always nice to see a solid deal on our favorite keyboard. The Logitech G Pro X TKL Lightspeed might have a mouthful of a name, but it’s as streamlined and stylish as they come. It sports bright backlit keys with your standard RGB setup, wireless connectivity, and a minimal, high quality design that fits right in on any desk. Beyond media controls and some buttons for functionality, the G Pro X TKL packs just the right features, and leaves the rest on the cutting room floor, which is why we like it. —Brad Bourque If you’re looking for a simple joystick for gaming, it’s hard to beat the value on the Logitech G Extreme 3D Pro USB Joystick. It isn’t the fanciest, and its plastic construction won’t impress true enthusiasts, but you’ll spend two or three times the price to get anything similar from a manufacturer as reputable as Logitech. It also sports a huge number of buttons, both on the handle and on the base, and a throttle slider that’s not as common on joysticks at this price point. That makes it the perfect joystick for a quick flight in Microsoft Flight Simulator or a few hours of space trucking in Elite Dangerous. —Brad Bourque The hardest console gamers know that quick reactions can be the difference between total glory and complete failure, so give yourself every advantage with the SCUFInstinct Pro controller for Xbox. This upgraded controller features improved materials for grip and comfort, plus a more premium build quality, but the best part is hidden around back. Four programmable paddles allow you to put your most important buttons right at your fingertips for lightning-fast access, giving you the ultimate edge against anyone who has to move their hand to hit the melee button. —Brad Bourque Our favorite USB microphone is sporting a decent discount, as it is fairly often. The Blue Yeti has a long history on the desks of streamers and podcasters, and for good reason. It sports solid audio performance, great build quality, and easy access to controls. That makes it a great option for anyone looking to upgrade from their gaming headset’s microphone, or to pair with some better headphones. —Brad Bourque This Intel Core i7-14700K 8-Core 5.6 GHz (LGA 1700 Socket) chip is a very solid performer and will work with any 700-series chipset-based motherboard. It'll get you through heavy workday tasks like video editing with ease and can handle 4K gaming. —Scott Gilbertson This is one of the best game controllers for PC gamers, with five central buttons on the front, a pair of rear paddles, and plenty of customization options. 8BitDo’s software lets you remap buttons, tweak the stick and trigger sensitivity, assign macros, and tune the vibration intensity. It’s compact with a grippy texture on the handles, satisfyingly clicky triggers, and a decent D-pad. There’s a 2.4G dongle in the handy charging dock for PC gaming, and battery life is around 20 hours. It also has Bluetooth support for Nintendo Switch players, making this a solid alternative to the Switch Pro controller. —Simon Hill Feel free to take $40 off the reasonably equipped Gigabyte B650, a mid-range AMD Ryzen motherboard with support for DDR5 RAM, 2.5Gbps Ethernet, and USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. While it isn’t the highest-end offering, notably missing PCIe 5.0, it still supports overclocking, and even has built-in Wi-Fi for easy connectivity. Make sure to check out our PC building guide for more info on what you should be looking for when purchasing a motherboard. —Brad Bourque Western Digital also makes excellent SSDs, and this one is no exception. The SN 770 M.2 2280 achieved speeds of 5,100 Mbps in my testing, which is blazing fast. If you're doing a lot of drive-intensive tasks, like editing video or gaming, this drive is well worth the money. The largest version you can get is 2 TB, but the price is reasonable considering the speed increase. —Scott Gilbertson Viture's Pro XR Glasses make for a great portable gaming display you can take anywhere. They have a large, virtual screen (135 inches), a smooth 120-Hz frame rate, and a maximum brightness of 4,000 nits. The company has done a solid job with the software too and tailored the experience for gamers. You can also, however, use these for watching movies or multitasking work. However, it's worth noting the Harman-tuned speakers are limited. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This LifeStraw has been featured in many an iteration of our outdoorsy gift guide (though we’ve replaced it this year). Nevertheless, it’s a good product. This LifeStraw can screw onto a plastic water bottle or be used as a straw to slurp up water from basically anywhere. It filters out at least 99.99 percent of bacteria, microplastics, and other gross contaminants. If you’re shopping for a prepper this holiday season, or you’re just like me and ill-prepared for the zombie apocalypse, this deal is worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe The Leatherman Wave+ is our top pick multi-tool. The tools flip out and retract with just the right mix of smoothness and tension, and the mix of tools here is very useful—two stainless steel knives, one with a straight edge and the other serrated, along with 16 other tools, including a wood-and-metal file, a diamond-coated file, a saw, Phillips screwdriver bits, scissors, an 8-inch ruler, and a wire stripper, as well as a bottle and can opener. The Branwyn bra is in our essential guide to merino wool, but I like it enough that I wrote a whole separate rave about it. Merino wool is a miracle fiber—it’s renewable, odor-resistant, regulates your temperature and doesn’t leave you with a terminal case of swamp booty should you choose to jump in a river with your hiking clothes on. What’s not to like? Everything at Branwyn is 25 percent off through December 3 (just add to your basket to see the discount). —Adrienne So I love my pellet smoker for cooking everything from meat to pizza—as does WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson in our guide to the Best Grills—which is why I highly recommend this Traeger. It can connect to Wi-Fi for easy monitoring of longer cooks, and features the classic easy-to-clean Traeger design that made the brand an icon in the first place. —Parker Hall The Breeo is the most overbuilt option on our best fire pits guide and wins our favor by opening the door to a complete ecosystem of products including a live-fire pizza oven and a flat-top grill for making smashburgers. This is a sizable sale on the pit. —Martin Cizmar Like the Coleman above, the RoadTrip 225 allows you to use only one burner, so you can grill a couple of burgers without draining your propane tank. With variable controls, you can sear veggies on one side while cooking meat more slowly on the other. There's a grease pan to catch drips while cooking, and it's removable for cleaning. You also get push-button ignition and 11,000 BTUs of propane grilling power. At this price, it's hard to beat these features. —Louryn Strampe Cupping therapy can be intimidating, but the TheraCup makes bringing spa-level treatment at home easy. It blends suction, heat, and vibration to mimic the effects of traditional cupping therapy. I’ve found it user-friendly, and with its auto-shutoff and safety sensors, I don’t have to worry about overdoing it. At $129 ($20 off), it’s a solid investment that will save you from splurging on professional sessions. —Boutayna Chokrane If you’re tired of itchy or sweaty socks, these Carhartts are a solid upgrade. WIRED’s self-proclaimed sock-hating outdoorsman, Scott Gilbertson, is living proof that these socks can convert even the most dedicated barefooters. He’d rather brave the snow wearing a pair of sandals; that is, until he was gifted the Carhartt Midweight Merino Wool Blend Crew Socks. These woolies are designed to keep your feet warm, dry, and odor-free—even after a full day of hiking. The midweight design strikes the ideal balance between breathability and insulation, perfect for year-round excursions. —Boutayna Chokrane The LifePro Sonic Massage Gun proves you don’t need to spend a fortune for a deep-tissue massage. With eight included attachments—yes, eight—it’s the most versatile massager we’ve tried. It’s more than capable of working even the most stubborn knots, and with five intensity levels, don’t worry about whether it packs a punch. —Boutayna Chokrane The PowerDot 2.0 Muscle Stimulator is a recent addition to my recovery routine. It pairs with your smartphone to provide personalized muscle recovery and strength training, and ease menstrual cramps. When I first tried it, I expected a sharp zap, but the sensation was surprisingly soothing, like a prickly, customizable massage. The Duo is ideal for multiple or larger areas, and it comes with everything you need: electrode pads, lead cables, a charger, and a carrying case. Note: I’ve encountered some connectivity hiccups with the app, and online reviews suggest I’m not alone. Still, when it works, it’s brilliant. —Boutayna Chokrane Niu’s scooters have long been reliable for me, with simple folding mechanisms and a comfy riding experience. That continues with the KQi 300X, a 49-pound escooter with 10.5-inch tubeless tires, regenerative braking, and a 16-mile range in my tests (I’m 6’4”, so you can probably go even further.) This one has turn signals too, though they are not time-based and need to be turned off manually. Still, this is one of the lower prices I’ve seen and great value. —Julian Chokkattu A sub-$3000 electric mountain bike is amazing, and Aventon’s version has incredible specs for the price point. Reviewer Steph Pearson was impressed by its smooth, consistent power. Its weight is a bit much (OK, it’s a lot) for technical singletrack, but if you have a commute that incorporates steep hills, dirt roads, or potholes, it’s the perfect ride.—Adrienne So If you just want something for quick trips to the grocery store or just puttering around your neighborhood, the Segway E2 Pro is probably more than enough. It’s affordable, even more so now with this deal, and the 350-watt motor does a decent job with small slopes. It’s 41 pounds, but you get tubeless tires, good brakes, and a 15-mph top speed. I usually managed a little under 10 miles. It’s also rare to see turn signals on an affordable scooter, which is a nice perk. Want to save even more? I’ve also tested the E2 Plus, which is now $280 ($70 off). It’s lighter and slower, but it does the job for short trips. —Julian Chokkattu I’ve now tested more than 50 pickleball paddles to make our guide to the best, but I have a soft spot for the SLK Evo, which was the first nice paddle I bought with my own money. It has a nice neutral feel and a great grip. You won’t be able to get much top spin off the fiberglass face, but it’s fine for anyone below the advanced level. —Martin Cizmar This inflatable hot tub is nice! The Coleman SaluSpa Ibiza (7/10, WIRED Review) is easy to set up and generally user-friendly. It takes a while to heat up, but when it’s rolling, it’s a great place to relax and unwind. The pump module has built-in cupholders and there are optional air jets to bubble away all of your worries. It’s got room for four to six people, though I think six would be a bit too cozy. Just make sure you have the space for it before purchasing. —Louryn Strampe Movement begets more movement! WIRED contributor Kristin Canning would have paid even full price for this walking pad. It feels good underfoot (she often walks on it wearing just socks), isn’t annoyingly loud, and doesn’t shake her standing desk. You can control it with both the remote or the app, and Canning prefers the app as the Bluetooth connectivity can get a bit wonky. —Adrienne So No one I know has ever regretted getting a walking pad. It helps even the least motivated of us get a little more movement into our day. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano noted that the Egofit is compact and easy to use and move. You can control it with a remote, and the digital screen displays time, calories burned, distance walked, steps, and walking speed (be warned, though, there is no pause button). —Adrienne So In our Smart Bird Feeders Buying Guide, we recommend this model as the prettiest, and we also like that it’s made with less plastic than other feeders. This bamboo Netvue Birdfy (6/10, WIRED Review) features an extendable perch and two large bins for bird seeds, and it includes a solar panel so you won’t need to charge or replace the batteries. The included 1080p camera will show you video feeds and pictures of bird visitors. You can pay more to get a lifetime subscription with AI that’ll help identify birds—though sometimes it gets it wrong. Note that, although it’s rot- and mold-resistant, it does need to be sealed with a bird-safe wood sealer. —Louryn Strampe This adorable stroller takes the features of a full-size stroller and packs them into a smaller package. The Thule Shine’s (9/10, WIRED Recommends) adjustable handlebar works for a huge variety of heights—both my 5’ mom and my 6'4" dad could comfortably push my son around in this stroller thanks to the five different height options, and the stroller can switch to do inward or outward facing and has accessories for car seats and a bassinet. It's one of my favorite full-sized strollers I've ever tried, and it's on sale for a nice discount. —Nena Farrell In our Best Treadmills roundup, WIRED contributor Kristin Canning notes that the incline ranges on the BowFlex Treadmill 22 are much greater than our top pick, the NordicTrack. That means it’s ideal for hill training, or if it’s dark and late outside and you can’t make yourself drive anywhere to prep for an upcoming road race. Bowflex has its own proprietary fitness programming with both on- and off-tread options, but you can also stream your own shows and movies, too. —Adrienne So Even if we weren’t always scaling rugged peaks, we used Rocky Talkies on almost every camping trip—you need a better way to talk to your family besides running around and yelling. Rocky Talkies have a few advantages over cheap walkies. They come with a carabiner to clip on your pack or clothes, so they don’t slide off; the battery life is much better, and it’s much easier to use. The push-to-talk button is even recessed so you don’t accidentally transmit your shit-talking. The waterproof mic and extra battery are also on sale. —Adrienne So We're huge fans of the Peloton Tread, it's actually one of the best home treadmills we've tested so far. It's sleek and beautiful, so it won't be an eyesore in your house and you'll have access to some of the most engaging fitness programming out there—complete with great music, top-tier instructors, and fun workouts. If you're more interested in one of the company's bikes, those are also on sale for up to $700. —Brenda Stolyar Jumping rope is one of the best ways to get an intense cardio workout without needing a lot of space, and Crossrope is one of the most fun ways to do it. It builds strength in the shoulders, forearms, and legs, and doing double-unders, crossovers, or other complicated steps is just fun. Subscribe to the app, get access to 2,500 workouts and over 35 different fitness programs, watch videos, and use your Bluetooth-connected jump rope to really show those CrossFitters what’s what. —Adrienne So Nothing can possibly fix you as much as cold plunges can, but devotees of the practice will tell you otherwise. Sun Home’s premium version is the only portable cold plunge tub that’s capable of getting to as low as 33 degrees, which you will need once you’ve acclimated to 40 degrees and need to get even colder to chase that euphoric high. It’s also sturdy, chills water quickly, and surprisingly, doesn’t add too much to your electricity bill.—Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you’re in the market for a travel bag, the Dagne Dover Petra Convertible Tote is a chameleon of carryalls. It’s part backpack, part tote, and even has a luggage pass-through that is a back-saver during long treks through airports. At nearly 17 inches tall, this bag is big, but it still fits under most airplane seats. We’re particularly fond of the padded compartments, offering extra protection for your tech gear and one less thing to worry about while rushing to your gate. —Boutayna Chokrane I love Calpak's clear cosmetic cases. They were viral for a reason, since it's easy to see where everything is thanks to the clear design, and the two separate sides make it easy to keep it from becoming a massive mess inside the bag. While the clear cases come in three sizes, only the largest size is on sale. WIRED editor Kat Merck didn’t find this case the easiest to travel with while reviewing it for the Best Toiletry Bags guide, but I use the medium-sized bag for my daily makeup. The large case is a great choice if you have a lot of makeup and skincare you're looking to easily store and keep organized. There are a couple colors that are 30 percent off, but most are 20 percent off, which is still a good deal. —Nena Farrell A carry-on is a highly personalized purchase—it’s both an accessory and one of the bags that endures the most abuse when you use it. Aer’s is more expensive than some of our other picks, but I particularly liked Aer’s for a few reasons. The polycarbonate surface doesn’t pick up dirt as easily as the Monos, and it doesn’t have ridges like the Beis. It also has specialized Hinamoto metal ball bearings for smoother rolling, as well as wheel locks, so it doesn’t slide all over the place when you have to take it on a shuttle. All of Aer’s luggage is 25 percent off through Dec. 2, but you’ll need to enter a SAVE20 discount code to get the deal. —Adrienne So Staying hydrated feels almost effortless with the Owala 40-ounce tumbler. We love Owalas for a few reasons: They’re free of BPA, lead, and phthalates, which should be a minimum standard for reusable water bottles. Owala’s trademark 2-in-1 lid makes this tumbler work with hot, cold, and carbonated beverages. And Owala’s limited-edition color palettes are dangerously addictive, making it hard not to grab one in every shade. So, if you’re eyeing a certain design, there’s no time like the present. —Boutayna Chokrane Several WIRED Gear team members use the Front-Range Harness. While I use the attachment point at the top behind my pup’s head, my colleague uses the bottom one, so if her dog Roux chases after a squirrel and pulls on the leash, he’ll just spin and face her. It has reflective strips for increased visibility and there’s padding for the undersides so they don’t dig in. They’re well-made and have held up after years of use. —Julian Chokkattu Some travel mugs dent if you so much as look at them wrong, but not the Hydro Flask. Its signature powder-coated exterior is as durable as it is sleek. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has been using hers for years without a single ding, making it a reliable choice for your busiest days and clumsiest moments. Plus, no lead here—unlike certain other tumblers we know (looking at you, Stanley). —Boutayna Chokrane Editor Kat Merck is obsessed with the Dagne Dover Mila Toiletry Organizer, which she uses for her cosmetics. Made from recycled materials, it’s sustainable, water-resistant, and easy to clean. Merck especially loves the thoughtful compartments: the carabiner for jewelry, the zippered pouch for hair ties and bobby pins, and the elastic loops for makeup brushes. The sections can feel snug for more than two full-sized products but are perfect for travel-sized essentials. P.S., the small model is also on sale for $38. —Boutayna Chokrane An honorable mention in our guide to the Best Toiletry Bags, this toiletry kit is a decent option for those who want a simple, well-made bag that can either hang or lay flat. There’s a snap-in plastic envelope for soap or a toothbrush, and the navy version I tested is made from recycled bottles. I wasn’t especially impressed with the bag’s organizational components in comparison to its size, and I didn’t like that the bag’s thick, small plastic hook couldn’t hang on a towel rack, but otherwise, I had no major complaints during my weeks of testing. It should also be noted this bag comes in almost 20 different colors and prints, from metallic pink to a basketball motif, so at this price it would make a great gift for adults and kids alike. —Kat Merck The Travelrest Nest Ultimate Travel Pillow (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is nearly perfect. The back is flat, which keeps your spine aligned, whereas the sides and front are high and firm, which keeps your neck supported. The microfiber cover is soft and machine washable, and the memory foam cover holds its shape without compressing too much. We just wish the stuff sack had an attachment point for easier toting around. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Our favorite mirrorless camera, Sony's A7 IV (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a 33-megapixel, full-frame camera capable of incredibly sharp images, with excellent dynamic range and great autofocus, and it's smaller than most of its competitors. There's five-axis image stabilization built-in, and it can shoot 7K oversampled 4K/30 fps video. —Scott Gilbertson The A7R V is the highest-resolution stills camera on the market (unless you opt for medium-format cameras). If that's not enough, there's a 16-shot, high-resolution mode that can create 240-MP images (so long as your subject is static, e.g., a landscape). The dynamic range is outstanding, and the autofocus speeds and smarts are some of the best we've seen. The only down side is the file size; fully uncompressed RAW files from this sensor run around 125 megabytes per image, though there are compressed options that will get them down to about 80 MP per image. —Scott Gilbertson GoPro's new Hero 13 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic action camera. The Hero 13 features a new interchangeable lens system, with Macro, Ultra Wide, and Anamorphic lenses, plus a set of four neutral density filters (all sold separately). The Hero 13 Black even autodetects which lens is attached and changes settings accordingly. It's a slick, if expensive, system, but this deal at least saves you some cash on the base camera, which you can put toward an extra lens. Except the Anamorphic, which won't be available until 2025. —Scott Gilbertson This deal has been running since the new Hero 13 Black launched earlier this year, and if you have the extra $40 to spare, I highly recommend the Hero 13 over the 12. But if you're on a tight budget, or just don't have any interest in the interchangeable lenses, the Hero 12 uses the same sensor and makes a great action cam. —Scott Gilbertson The DJI Air 3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains one of our favorite drones, despite the brand new Air 3S. The new Air 3S brings larger sensors, which do improve the video a bit, but the Air 3 is still a fantastic dual-camera drone and, at this price, a better value than the new Air 3S. —Scott Gilbertson The Osmo Action 4 has been surpassed by the new Osmo Action 5, but the Action 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is still a fantastic action camera, especially at this price. The magnetic mounting system is great, the menu system makes switching between modes a snap, and the resulting photos and video are excellent. —Scott Gilbertson Insta360's Ace Pro was just replaced by the new Ace Pro 2, but this is a good deal on what is still a great camera. Capable of recording up to 8K 24 fps, with solid stabilization, good color handling, and a Leica lens to boot, there's a lot to love here, especially for only $300. That said, unless you think you're going to use the 8K (which is really only usable in still shots, not action footage), the Osmo Action 4 deal above is a better value. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite 360 camera, Insta360's X4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), features a 1/2-inch sensor capable of 8K video, which is as high-resolution as you can get in a 360-degree camera. The 8K resolution means you can reframe your footage to fit rectangular video formats and still have high-quality clips sharp enough to mix with other sources. It doesn’t reframe to 4K (you'll have to wait for 12K footage before that's possible), but it's good enough for anything you'd put on social media. —Scott Gilbertson The Insta360 Go 3S (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is just plain fun. It's a hybrid camera that transforms from a traditional action-camera form factor to a more portable go-anywhere wearable camera. In action camera mode, it's much like the Ace Pro above. The sensor isn't as big so the image quality isn't as good, but you get the flip-up rear screen. The camera itself is waterproof to 33 feet (10 meters). The case can also continue to act as a remote monitor even when you pull the camera out. Couple that with the extremely strong magnetic mounting system on the camera pod, and the Go 3 becomes capable of shots and angles that no other action camera can match. —Scott Gilbertson If you want an instant camera and don't want to spend a lot, the Instax Mini 12 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is your best bet. It's a capable, easy-to-use camera wrapped in a colorful, bubbly design. One thing you'll find here that's missing even on more expensive models is parallax correction. That means you don't have to guess where the center of the frame is for close-up subjects. What you see is what you get, eliminating those accidentally ill-framed close-ups that sometimes happen with other instant cameras. —Scott Gilbertson The Sprocket Photo Printer offers the best results of the ink mini printers we've tested. It's roughly the size of a phone and connects with iPhone, iPad, or Android phones via Bluetooth. The mobile app lets you edit and customize your photos before printing. There's also an option to tile your images onto multiple prints for a larger, pieced-together image. —Scott Gilbertson The Polaroid Now+ has the typical features you'd expect from a Polaroid: vintage aesthetics, roll-out film, and a nice chunky body with easy-to-find buttons. What sets it apart is the smartphone companion app, which gives you the option to use features like Tripod Mode, Manual Mode, or setting a custom f-stop in Aperture Priority Mode. The Now+ also lets you take double exposures. It's pricey but it offers a good blend of modern methods and vintage execution. —Scott Gilbertson The Flir One Gen 3 is the largest of the thermal cameras we've tested. It’s about 2.6 inches wide and 1.3 inches tall, and it fits a lot into that space, including a built-in battery and two cameras. The first is the IF camera which captures 80 x 60-pixel images and then combines them with the second camera, which grabs a higher resolution image of visible light, which the device smooths and scales up to a nice, pretty clear, 1,440 x 1,080-pixel image. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite place to print photos is having a 30 percent off sale on its print services. Mpix makes high-quality prints at a reasonable price even when it's full price, which makes this a great deal. Mpix prints on Kodak Endura paper and offers a variety of paper options. I tested the E-surface, which renders rich, deep blacks and true-to-life colors. It holds up well over time; the images we printed in 2013 look exactly like they did when we got them. We also like Mpix's books and calendars. —Scott Gilbertson If you need to print gifts for your family, Shutterfly is having a sitewide 50 percent off sale. We're fans of Shutterfly's book printing service, which had the best results so far in our testing of photo printing services. We also like the calendars. The printing is good enough, especially for the price, and shipping is generally speedy. —Scott Gilbertson

Title: It's a really bad time to be a middle manager
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/middle-manager-hiring-white-collar-recession-layoffs-jobs-efficiency-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-02T09:03:01Z
Full Content:
America is undergoing a rapid corporate restructuring — and middle managers are in big trouble Over the past two years, American businesses have been engaged in a rapid-fire restructuring of their corporate hierarchies. In the name of "flattening," they've been waging war on middle managers — trimming an entire tier of supervisory jobs that Mark Zuckerberg derided as nothing more than "managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work." Following Meta's lead, Citi reduced its 13 layers of management to eight. UPS axed 12,000 of its 85,000 managers. And in September, Amazon announced plans to increase its ratio of workers to supervisors by at least 15%. "I hate bureaucracy," CEO Andy Jassy declared, echoing the zeal for "efficiency" that Elon Musk, one of the pioneers of the current corporate flattening, is now seeking to unleash on the halls of government. But here's the thing: It's not just that tens of thousands of middle managers have lost their jobs. It's that the jobs themselves have been eliminated — and they may not be coming back. To test that theory, I asked Revelio Labs, a workforce analytics provider, to crunch the numbers for me, using its database of job postings aggregated from across the internet. It divided employees into two buckets of managers (senior leadership and middle management) and two buckets of lower-level employees (experienced associates and junior workers). Then it looked at how many job openings employers are posting today, compared with the hiring heyday of 2022. What the data reveals is stark. Earlier this year, when white-collar hiring was at its lowest point, openings for junior roles — entry-level positions requiring little to no prior experience — were down by 14%. But hiring had plunged by 43% for middle managers and 57% for senior leaders. If you had any sort of management experience, your job prospects were bleak. Since then, though, we've seen a significant rebound in job postings for almost everyone — except middle managers. In October, employers were still advertising 42% fewer middle-management positions than they did in April 2022. Which means that those who lost their jobs in the Great Flattening are now facing a whole new horror: There aren't any positions left for them to take. The assault on middle managers dates back to the 1980s, when globalization gave rise to a new philosophy of management that prioritized cost cutting over everything else. Supervisors — earning big salaries for rubber-stamping the work of their subordinates — became an easy target. Trim the fat, the thinking went, and the efficiencies will follow. From 1986 to 1998, one study found, the number of managers reporting to division heads dropped by 25%. At the same time, the number of managers reporting directly to a CEO nearly doubled. Executives got the flattening that they wanted. But it's unclear whether getting rid of middle managers actually made companies run more efficiently. As I wrote last year, one study found that businesses with fewer layers of management were able to deliver their products faster. But study after study found that when middle managers do their jobs right, they bolster performance more than either top executives or ground-level employees. Supervisors do real work. They motivate. They mentor. They communicate critical information to and from different parts of the company. They smooth out glitches and spot opportunities. They're the ones who keep the trains running. But now is an especially bad time to be an experienced supervisor. According to an analysis by Live Data Technologies, another workforce analytics provider, middle managers made up 32% of layoffs last year, compared with 20% in 2019. And as the data from Revelio Labs shows, companies appear to have no intention of refilling those supervisory roles, even as they resume hiring for lower-level jobs. That has created a double whammy for middle managers: There's a sharp spike in job seekers, and they're competing for an increasingly small universe of open roles. Over the past year I've heard from hundreds of managers mired in this double whammy. What's struck me is how eerily similar their stories are. They all come across as smart and articulate. They're all in their late 40s to 50s. When they got laid off from their supervisory jobs, they didn't expect their job search to be too difficult. After all, they'd spent decades honing their skills and climbing the corporate ladder, often at leading companies. Surely, all that experience had to count for something. But despite sending out hundreds of applications, they can't get anyone to return their calls. They're utterly baffled, and they all have the same question: What is going on here? It's the question I've been asking, too — combing through government data, talking to employers and economists, studying applicant-tracking systems. Because so many of the frustrated job seekers are older, I thought maybe we were seeing some new form of age discrimination: Call it the Curse of the Gen X Professional. But it's only after seeing the data from Revelio Labs that I finally understand what's going on: There just aren't enough supervisory jobs to go around anymore. In response, many displaced managers have swallowed their pride and started applying to jobs lower on the corporate food chain. As Revelio Labs' data shows, nonmanagerial jobs are faring much better these days — and you'd think companies would be thrilled to get the experience and know-how of seasoned professionals on the cheap. But take the example of a former middle manager I'll call Rick, who is 54. After getting rejected for all the supervisory jobs he could find, he widened his search to include entry-level positions — only to be rejected for being overqualified. At this point, all Rick wants is a chance to prove himself. "Forget the titles, forget all that other stuff," he told me. "I just need a job. My unemployment runs out in about 30 days. I'll come in and do a great job for you." This is the paradox that lies at the heart of the Great Flattening: The very experience that should be a selling point for senior leaders has become a liability. Some have tried deleting former jobs from their resumes, to hide their supervisory experience. Others, like Rick, omit the year they graduated from college. One former chief operating officer, whose search has gone so poorly that she's now applying to be an executive assistant, told me she addresses her overqualified-ness in her cover letters. "I understand that my résumé has some big titles on it, but let me tell you who I am at heart," she writes. "I really want to be doing this, and I'm not wedded to the title." What all the out-of-work managers want to know is: When is the hiring freeze for supervisors going to thaw? That depends, in large part, on whether companies come to view the flattening as a success. Many CEOs insist they aren't getting rid of middle managers just to save money. They think having fewer layers of management will, as Zuckerberg put it, create a "stronger" company that can build "higher-quality products faster." That hints at a dark prospect for managers like Rick: The rung of the corporate ladder they spent their careers reaching could be gone for good. There's a chance, of course, that the current craze for corporate flattening could ease over time. Companies are already discovering that having few middle managers is placing an enormous strain on their operations. The supervisors who survived the purge have been forced to take on much larger teams, and they're burned out to a crisp. Gen Zers, deprived of their mentors, are increasingly disengaged. Departments are more siloed than ever, with no one to do the tedious and thankless and essential work of coordinating across different teams. The best hope for managers like Rick is that CEOs are getting a real-time refresher in the value of managers. "I'm not at that point in my life where I'm ready to take that step back," Rick told me. "I just want to work with good people and enjoy what I'm doing. I could go to Domino's and start delivering pizza. But I know I can do a lot more than that."

Title: Bitcoin Strategy: Here’s What Michael Saylor Told Microsoft’s Leadership
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-strategy-what-michael-saylor-told-microsoft/
Time Published: 2024-12-02T07:15:21Z
Full Content:
Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy and a prominent Bitcoin evangelist, has held his 3-minute presentation to the Microsoft (MSFT) Board of Directors and CEO Satya Nadella, articulating why the company should adopt BTC as a reserve asset. Saylor, who was invited to present his insights, emphasized the critical importance of embracing the leading cryptocurrency as a cornerstone of modern financial strategy. “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave and Bitcoin is that wave,” Saylor declared at the outset of his presentation. He continued, “Bitcoin represents the greatest digital transformation of the 21st century. It represents digital capital.” Delving into the mechanics of global wealth distribution, Saylor highlighted the dichotomy between utility-providing assets and those dedicated to capital preservation. “Global wealth is distributed across assets that provide utility and others that preserve Capital, but risk is destroying trillions of dollars of that Capital every single year,” he explained. Saylor articulated BTC’s superiority over traditional forms of capital preservation, stating, “Digital capital is economically and technically superior to physical capital, and it represents a revolutionary advance in capital preservation.” He projected a significant expansion of Bitcoin as asset class, asserting, “The asset class itself is growing from trillions to hundreds of trillions of dollars and it is backed by digital power along with political and economic power.” Addressing the strategic financial decisions faced by large corporations like Microsoft, Saylor made a strong case for BTC’s central role. “It makes sense for Microsoft to be powered by digital capital. Bitcoin’s the best asset you can own. The numbers speak for themselves,” he stated unequivocally. He contrasted a BTC investment with traditional corporate financial maneuvers, arguing, “it makes a lot more sense to buy Bitcoin than to buy your own stock back or to hold Bitcoin rather than holding bonds if you’re going to outperform. You’re going to need Bitcoin and those bonds are undermining your options market and your equity liquidity.” Saylor also underscored the burgeoning institutional and governmental support, reinforcing its viability as a strategic asset. “Luckily you have an alternative. Public support for Bitcoin is surging, as is political support, as is support for the US Bitcoin strategic reserve, as is Wall Street support and the president of the United States says ‘never sell your Bitcoin.’” Framing the current period as a transformative era, Saylor proclaimed, “We’re entering year one of the crypto Renaissance and you have a choice to make: cling to the past or embrace the future.” He cautioned against the financial stagnation associated with traditional investment strategies, stating, “You’ve surrendered hundreds of billions of dollars of capital over the past five years and you’ve just amplified the risks that your own shareholders face.” He added, “if you want to escape that vicious cycle, you’re going to need an asset without counterparty risk. What if you could buy a hundred billion dollar company growing faster than Microsoft for one time revenue? What if you could keep doing it every single year? it’s time for Microsoft to evaluate its Bitcoin strategic options.” To facilitate the integration of BTC into Microsoft’s financial operations, Saylor also introduced an open-source model. “We’ve created an open-source model, you can plug in your own assumptions. You can convert your cash flows and your dividends and your buybacks and your debt into Bitcoin,” he explained. He projected substantial financial benefits from this integration, claiming, “If you do that, you’ll add hundreds of dollars to the stock price. You can create trillions of dollars of enterprise value. You can strip away risk from your shareholders and you can prosper on the Bitcoin standard. So do the right thing for the world and adopt Bitcoin.” The community reactions have been swift and varied following Saylor’s presentation. Luke Broyles from The Bitcoin Adviser commented via X: “58 slides in 191 seconds… or 3.2 seconds per slide. It is brilliant, hilarious, and frankly sad that Microsoft would only allow a 3 minute presentation from Michael Saylor. Brilliant to cover so many slides so investors/shareholders have to review them all. Hilarious that he was actually able to do it.” As reported by Bitcoinist, Microsoft shareholders are currently voting on whether the company should invest in BTC. The proposal, prompted by a shareholder initiative, suggests using corporate funds to purchase BTC. Microsoft’s board of directors has urged shareholders to reject the proposal, arguing against the strategic fit and potential risks associated with an investment. Shareholders can participate in the voting process online via proxy ahead of Microsoft’s annual shareholder meeting on December 10, 2024. At press time, BTC traded at $96,331.

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more Update: Cyber Monday may be over now, but many stores will slide into 'Cyber Week' to ride out the holiday deals event a little longer. We've been highlighting deals below since before Black Friday last week. Many will be expiring as we speak, but it's worth a quick look as some could continue on for a few more days. Original article follows: The S90D is our favorite 2024 TV overall. Its QD-OLED panel delivers a high-contrast image with vivid colors, wide viewing angles, and impressive brightness for this class. The U6N is one of the top budget TVs available. The 4K QLED display uses quantum dots, local dimming, and a Mini LED backlight to deliver higher contrast and a wider range of colors than most competitors in its class. The C4 is LG's latest midrange 4K OLED TV. It carries over everything we loved about last year's C3 while offering a slight increase in brightness and support for a faster 144Hz refresh rate with a PC. Samsung's Frame TV can be mounted flush against your wall like a hanging piece of art. It also features a matte screen to make it look more like canvas, and you can purchase optional magnetic frame bezels in different colors and designs. This 100-inch TV is a whopping size that will allow you to catch every inch of every game. With up to 800 nits of HDR brightness, local dimming, and a fast 144Hz refresh rate, this is one of the best values there is at this size. TCL's S5 LED display doesn't use quantum dots like the brand's pricier QLED TVs, but it's still capable of wide color support and it uses the Amazon Fire TV OS for easy integration with Alexa. The TCL QM7 is an impressive midrange QLED TV. Its Mini LED contrast performance, high brightness, and 144Hz gaming capabilities are nearly unrivaled at this price range. The B4 is LG's entry-level OLED TV. Though it can't get as bright as pricier models, it still offers an infinite contrast which makes it a great budget OLED for watching movies in a dark room. TCL's S5 is one of the brand's entry-level 4K TVs. Brightness and contrast are limited compared to pricier models, but the S5 still offers a wide range of colors and has Alexa built-in. This 720p TV comes with Alexa Voice Remote capabilities, so you can easily search across apps, switch inputs, and much more using your voice — no clunky remotes and tedious typing necessary. We only recommend it if you can find it on sale, though. Paramount Plus offers a huge library of on-demand content from Paramount, CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. The Premium Plan also includes Showtime and live CBS streaming. It costs $12.99 a month or $120 a year. For the next two months, though, you get this tier for just $2.99 a month, which is a great opportunity to make your way through a few shows with no irritating ads - of which there are many on the ad-supported tier. Paramount Plus is perfect for viewers who want to stream CBS TV shows, local NFL games, and tons of content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. And if you get the premium tier you can also unlock ad-free streaming and access to Showtime. A new promotion sees the monthly fee knocked down to $2.99 for a couple of months. There's a huge double-saving on these two bundled popular ad-supported streaming platforms as this price lasts for 12 months. If you subscribe to these two individually, they're $9.99 a month each. Outside of Cyber Monday, this already-discounted Duo package would be $10.99, but less than a cup of coffee a month for the next year is unbeatable value. Offer expires December 2. Hulu is an excellent choice for cord-cutters thanks to a mix of exclusive titles and next-day streaming for popular network shows. The ad-supported tier is usually $9.99 a month, but the epic Cyber Monday deal has returned, lowering those monthly fee prices to just 99 cents for a year. We'd spend an extra couple of bucks and get it bundled with Disney Plus, though. Both offers expire December 2. Peacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming. The annual version of Peacock's ad-supported tier is an absolute steal right now, with a major Cyber Monday discount getting you a whole year of access for just $19.99. That's plenty of time to enjoy a rich collection of sitcoms, movies, and live events. Offer expires December 2. The Starz streaming service offers several original shows and classic movies. The semi-annual plan is a steal compared to a standard month-to-month subscription. Fubo is the streaming service for sports fans. Its huge library of channels includes regional and international sports leagues, setting it apart from the competition. You can also tack on additional programming to your plan, but it'll cost you extra. The Leesa Sapira Hybrid Mattress provides great edge support and motion isolation. Its mix of memory foam and pocket springs produces an average firmness, making it an outstanding solution for back pain sufferers of any sleeping style. Save an extra $25 with our exclusive promo code INSIDER25. The Saatva Classic Mattress is designed to suit a variety of sleeping styles and features a plush top for luxurious comfort. The DreamCloud Premier Hybrid Mattress performed well in all of our tests, which makes it ideal for most sleeping types, couples, and people who tend to overheat at night. Casper has redesigned its classic hybrid mattress into the Dream, which offers a medium-firm feel that sleeps cool and has zone support. While we haven't tested it yet, the Nectar Premier is designed to be a step up in comfort from the Classic, which we love. At under $1,000, it's the brand's most popular model. The gel memory foam of the Nectar makes it a versatile mattress that conforms to the contours of your body to relieve pressure. It's a premium sleep experience, but its price tag is way under a grand. The memory foam of the Bear mattress, combined with Celliant technology, makes this a great bed for active folks looking for some rest and recovery. Apply code BFCM4TY to save 40% off at checkout, and get free pillows, instead of the automatically applied deal. The Big Fig Mattress is constructed for heavier individuals with firm support and a high weight capacity. The Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress features contouring foam that cradles sleepers of all body types and sleeping styles while offering outstanding pressure relief and heat dissipation. The Scuba is a crowd-favorite style from lululemon, and this version has a roomy, oversized fit alongside the style's signature fleecy fabric. This simple knit is made with a blend of recycled and virgin cashmere. It comes in five colorways. "Jenni Kayne's cashmere sweaters are a splurge for sure, but this one is the best luxury-grade cardigan I've tried," writes associate style editor Gabrielle Chase. “Upon feeling the soft material, I knew that the piece was quality and would hold up after more than just a few wears and washes,” says freelance reporter Olivia Rose Rushing. “I was surprised at just how comfy it was — especially since I was able to adjust the shoulder straps to my liking.” This pushup bra uses a super-soft sheen microfiber fabric with extra-compressive side wings for a smoothing effect. It’s designed to be invisible under clothing. Featuring a sumptuous sherpa collar, an asymmetrical closure, and a soft leather construction, this trend-forward jacket will keep you warm all season long, sans sacrificing style. With 700-fill power, responsibly-sourced goose down, a water-repellent and wind-resistant fabric, and a removable hood, this cropped puffer will keep you warm all through winter. It comes in 11 colors. “I’ve been buying Abercrombie & Fitch winter coats for years, and I’ve never been disappointed in a purchase," says freelance writer Talia Ergas. "The Ultra Puffer turned out to be everything I hoped for. The puffiness is balanced nicely by the short silhouette and luxurious faux fur accents. I also love that the bottom hem is elastic, so it hugs my hips and keeps the cold out.” This soft, smooth raschel fleece jacket is lightweight and insulating. Plus, it's made from 100% recycled materials. There’s no time like the present to layer up in a seriously cozy flannel shirt jacket. Complete with a quilted lining, it’s a perfectly rugged layer atop a thermal shirt on brisk winter mornings. Turn back the clock with this throwback rugby shirt, a Ralph Lauren staple for decades that looks as great now as it did back in the day. This cozy knit is a versatile layering piece thanks to its breathable cotton construction. While it’s a men’s sweater, many of our female editors found the sizing to be perfectly oversized for all shapes, sizes, and genders. This jacket feels like a plush fleece but is still thin enough for winter layering. It comes in several different color options, from navy to green or brown. This effortlessly cool mini skirt stands out for its functional cargo pockets and stretchy cotton moleskin fabric—and it looks equally great paired with a graphic tee or sweater as it does with a blouse and tights. These size-inclusive jeans are available in petite and tall lengths and have an extra two inches in the hips to create an easy-going, flattering fit. While some styles of Bonobos’ classic chinos aren’t on sale, these refined brushed twill chinos in a range of seasonal colors are up for grabs. They also come with Bonobos’ eye-catching lined pockets for a colorful touch of flair. Wear these medium-compression shorts under your ensemble for a smoothing effect. Designed with an ultra-thin, breathable fabric that is moisture-wicking and quick-drying and a no-squeeze silicone waistband that prevents rolling, this shapewear is as comfy as it is flattering. These best-selling booties have a chic baby heel and an elongated toe, with a padded interior for an easier break-in period. These sophisticated leather boots are well-suited for nearly any occasion, be it a trip to the office or a night out with friends. The 2.5-inch stacked heel adds a nice boost in height—that is, without needing to sacrifice on comfort. L.L.Bean's shearling-lined 10-inch boots are the warmest of the bunch, but any of the Bean Boots will serve you well through both fall and winter, and they go with most outfits. The boot that made L.L.Bean a household name. These boots are designed to keep feet dry, warm, and comfortable in rain, mud, and other wet conditions. As the second iteration of the Tree Dasher running sneaker, this version is even more comfortable and equipped for performance. Allbirds Women's Tree Runner sneakers are crazy comfortable with a flattering and close-fitting silhouette and have a smooth but texturized upper. It’s hard to think of a more legendary sneaker than Air Jordans. The Mid version, originally released in 2001, offers the classic look, cushioning, and stability of the OG High Top while being less restrictive and even more affordable (all colorways are on sale). They may be small, but these chunky double hoops add big style to any outfit. Choose from four color and metal combinations: double gold, double silver, gold/marble blue, gold/silver. With seven princess-cut diamonds set on a white gold band, this ring is perfect for a wedding band or special occasion. The coziest version of the cult-favorite belt bag, this fleecy material adds a comfy, lived-in feel to any winter outfit. The Mini Bow Bag is one of our favorite all-occasion bags for its versatility. It's equally at home at a formal event or a day on the town, and you can carry it as a top-handle bag, over-the-shoulder, or cross-body. This sleek leather wallet is ideal for those with dexterity issues as it can be opened with one hand, and it snaps shut with a satisfying magnetic seal. The 2022 MacBook Air introduced Apple's M2 processor, which improved performance over the M1 version. It has an especially thin and lightweight design, an improved webcam, and a larger display. Make sure to check for the 16GB RAM model, as it's becoming the standard base option instead of the original 8GB RAM model. The Series 10 is thinner than its predecessors, with a larger case and screen overall. It runs on the S10 processor; it has a wide-angle OLED display for easier reading at an angle, faster charging, and media playback from its speakers. The second-generation Apple Watch SE is an impressive entry-level wearable that shares the same processor as the Series 8 and Ultra, so it's still smooth despite being two years old. It doesn’t have the advanced health sensors of premium models, but it offers enough features to satisfy most people. Verizon is offering the iPhone 16 for free as long as the line using the phone is on the Unlimited Ultimate plan and the user doesn't switch phones for 36 months. The iPhone 16 Pro Max's year-over-year upgrades include a larger, 6.9-inch display, upgraded cameras, the powerful A18 Pro processor, and industry-leading battery life. New and existing Verizon customers can trade-in any phone in any condition from Apple, Google, or Samsung to get the iPhone 16 Pro free. You must keep the iPhone 16 Pro for 36 months (three years) to keep the deal active, and can't upgrade to a new phone. The line that's using this deal must have or upgrade to Verizon's Unlimited Ultimate plan. You also need service plans for the free iPad and Apple Watch. There may be a one-time $35 activation fee. It's possible to get an iPhone 16 Pro Max with this deal, but it would cost $5/month for 36 months. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is Samsung's top-end phone in 2024, set apart from its Galaxy S24 siblings and most of the premium phone competition with its four cameras, giant 6.8-inch display, stunning battery life, and included S Pen stylus. The Pixel 9 Pro XL offers a large 6.8-inch display and one of the best battery test results we've seen in a phone. The Pixel 9 Pro shares the same performance, first-rate three-lens camera system, super-bright Actua display, and Gemini AI suite with a free year of Gemini Advanced. Mint's Unlimited plan offers unlimited talk, text, and data, but you'll be slowed to 4G LTE speeds after using 40GB. New customers can get half off their first three months when they pay up front. We recommend signing up for the Unlimited option to score the most savings since it's typically the priciest of the lineup. When you buy an eligible phone through Mint Mobile, you can bundle it with a year of an unlimited data plan at a 50% discounted rate of just $15/month. The MVNO is also heavily discounting several phones from their standard starting prices, including up to $500 off the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Dell's line of premium XPS laptops are known for their performance and reliability. The 9530 series features Intel's Core i7-13620H processor and starts with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. That should be plenty of performance and storage for most people with busy, fast-paced workloads. This Dell Inspiron's display folds 180-degrees to turn the laptop into a tablet. Running on the AMD Ryzen 5 8640HS processor, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage, it can handle most people's workloads with ease. The base model IdeaPad 1 comes with a large 15-inch screen and runs on the entry-level AMD Ryzen 3 7320U processor with 4GB RAM and 128GB of storage. It's purely for very basic uses, like lightweight web browsing, but it's priced well for its purpose.

Amazon's latest Kindle Paperwhite offers even faster performance than its predecessors in the same thin, waterproof form readers love. The latest version of the Echo Show 8 features improved audio, a built-in smart home hub, a better processor, and a revised design featuring edge-to-edge glass with a centered camera. Amazon’s fifth-generation Echo Dot offers improved sound quality over previous models, along with a temperature sensor and Eero WiFi extender capabilities. Samsung's Galaxy Watch 4 may be an older smartwatch, but it's still one of the best on the market, and now that it's available at a lower price, it's a great budget option for Android users. The latest Google Pixel Watch offers robust fitness tracking benefits like Fitbit Morning Brief, advanced running features, and target cardio load. With rapid two-sided printing (up to 35 pages per minute), a 250 sheet tray, and a built-in scanner/copier, HP's multi-function printer is a great choice for a home or small office setup. The touchscreen display makes navigating all the features super simple, too. ExpressVPN's two-year plan offers even more savings than its one-year counterpart, including six months free. The 30-month plan features all of ExpressVPN's standard perks, as well as the brand-new Identity Defender suite for US subscribers, which includes a monthly credit report and data removal.

For Cyber Week, you can save 10% when you purchase The Nugget and The Chunk play ottoman together in the Big Orange Box Set. Gorgeously full and lush, this tree is one of the most realistic artificial trees you can buy and the top pick from our testing. Sale pricing varies by size and light choice, but we recommend opting for the Twinkly smart light option, which will allow you to fully customize the color and pattern of your tree lights. With their celebrity creators, high production value, and intuitive app, MasterClass videos feel more like edutainment than traditional online courses. Flexispot's most premium and heavy-duty offering, the E7 Pro has a powerful motor, greater adjustability, and a semi-C Leg structure for added stability and comes with a 15-year warranty. This leather beauty conceals a major secret, where you won't have to sacrifice style for the comfort of reclining.

It's beloved by frequent fliers, holds everything you need and then some, and stands out from the competition thanks to its attention to detail at every point.

In our tests, soft-side bags surprisingly tend to be more durable than hard-sided bags and offer a bit more flexibility in packing space. One of our editor's recently tested this human-sized dog bed, calling it a "dream come true" and "like laying in a supportive cloud." The Coop Sleep Goods Original Pillow offers thoughtful features like adjustable fill, a washable pillow cover, and an unparalleled 100-night trial, making it the best choice for most people. Whether you want to knot it up for lounging on the couch, prop your feet on it, or snuggle up for a cozy night’s sleep, the Buffy Wiggle Pillow offers great full-body support. It's also sustainably made. If you take your sleep comfort seriously, the pampering touch and good looks of Brooklinen's Luxe Sheets will make you want to stay in bed longer. Plus, they get softer with wear. Soft but not too thin, the Parachute Down-Alternative Pillow has the perfect loft for stomach sleepers who want just a bit of cushion. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24).

The built-in heatsink saves you a few dollars over buying one yourself and makes for a slightly easier installation process. 1TB/2TB is plenty for most gamers and is where the best value lies as the price jump on larger capcities is wildly disproportionate on a dollar per GB ratio. The J9+ is a powerful robot vacuum that deftly navigates around household obstacles, leaves hardwood floors spotless, and tackles low-pile carpets with ease. Although we haven't tried this exact model, we've tested a similar Shark 2-1 robot vacuum with Matrix technology and had great results. It has both standard suction and mopping abilities, hence the 2-1 in the name.

The Dyson V11 Extra cordless vacuum cleaner is engineered with the power, versatility and run time for a whole-home deep clean. This cordless vacuum can help suck up pesky pet hair from anywhere in the house. At 4.5 quarts, this stand mixer is a bit smaller than we usually recommend for folks who want a full-size mixer, but this is a stellar deal if you don't mind the more petite capacity. The OXO Brew Conical Burr Grinder grinds slowly, but that in turn reduces static, noise, and inconsistencies in your grounds. Make cooking easier with the Ninja Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) and its five different cooking settings. From baking to dehydrating, this air fryer can be the new secret touch behind your recipes. This massive 14-qt. air fryer is just $50, and is equipped to handle large family-sized meals with two racks to cook double the food.

It includes frying pans, a stock pot, saucepans with lids, and more.

It may be pricey, but if you're looking for a high-tech hair dryer that actually lives up to the hype, the Dyson Super Sonic may be for you. The Dyson Airwrap is a little too much blow-dryer-brush for most people, but there are few systems that give you such versatility.

Rihanna created this fragrance specifically for her own body and decided to share it with the world.

This cult-favorite concealer offers lightweight coverage that sinks seamlessly into the skin. This one-of-a-kind moisturizer is part skincare, part makeup. It's packed with nourishing oils like grapeseed. But instead of absorbing into your skin, the moisturizing ingredients sit on the surface and create a dewy glow that's also hydrating your skin.

Two years ago, when I was busy hunting down an Xbox Series X, I wished someone from the future told me I wouldn't need one to play Xbox games. Much of my gaming isn't even through the pricey console but my Game Pass subscription. If I had resisted FOMO and waited, I could have saved hundreds by getting the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max instead, bundled with a wireless controller and one month of Game Pass Ultimate. Game Pass is the Xbox's cloud-based game streaming service, and the Ultimate package lets you access all available games on any supported device, including the latest Amazon Fire TV Stick. You're ready to play once you have the Xbox app downloaded and the controller connected. The Fire TV Stick is also a good option for when you're traveling and away from your Xbox console. With Game Pass, you can pick up a game where you left off. No, you won't get the full experience as you would on a Series X or Series S machine. But as long as you have a good connection, the visuals look great, and the gameplay feels similar to playing on the console. Les Shu I can't shower in silence. I need music, a podcast, or something to listen to. Enter the JBL Go 3 Bluetooth Speaker, currently just $30 for Cyber Monday. I like that it's waterproof, durable, gets plenty loud, and has decent sound quality, even when I crank it as I sing along to Kate Bush. Full disclosure: I've purchased two of these speakers. The first one lasted over two years before it stopped charging (it recharged using a USB-C connection). You see, I kept the speaker in the shower with me. So, every day, it would get completely drenched. That kind of treatment will cause any electronics to malfunction. So, I bought a replacement and kept it outside the shower, within reach, and it's worked like a charm. I have little patience for malfunctioning electronics and haven't had any troubles with the JBL Go 3. I especially like how easily it pairs with my phone via Bluetooth and stays connected for quite a distance when I wander off. At $30, this matches the lowest price ever for the JBL Go 3. I strongly recommend it for you or as an affordable gift for the shower singer in your life. Abercrombie has come a long way as a brand, especially when it comes to sizing. Gone are the days of disappointment from a roster of impossibly tiny sizes — we've since welcomed an era of unexpected but much-appreciated inclusivity. Our style team has been testing jeans for years, and Abercrombie's denim is some of the best for the price. You can read our review of Abercrombie jeans or check out the current Cyber Monday sale, which includes an automatic 25% off nearly every pair and an extra 15% off once you add them to your cart. Most of the brand's jeans come in sizes 23 up to 37, and many also come in several length options, including extra short, short, regular, long, and extra long. I'm just over 5 feet tall and I mostly wear the extra short or short sizes. I love that they don't just offer a single petite or tall length and call it a day — you can really get the size that's best for you. This discount is the best any of us have seen this year so far and we doubt it will happen again for a while, so you might want to get a move on tonight! Sally Kaplan If you have oily lids like me, you know how tough it is to keep your eyeshadow looking good throughout the day. With my almond-shaped eyes, I also experience a lot of trouble keeping eyeliner crisp in my outer corners, as most formulas rub away after a few hours. That's why I love Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion — and right now, it's only $14, so I had to stock back up. The formula itself is sheer, but a little goes a long way. A thin coat keeps my eye makeup lasting all day, even in finicky places like my creases or outer corners. I've been a fan for years, and every year, I wait for this product to go on sale during Black Friday or Cyber Monday to restock. This year, I lucked out, and it was only half-price, making it super easy to add to the cart. We cover a lot of makeup here at Insider Reviews. Check out our beauty coverage to learn more about the best products for you, from waterproof mascaras to opaque concealers. Sarah Saril I'm not much of a beauty guru, but I love perfume. My prized Bond NYC bottle is running low, so I'm on the hunt for a new signature scent. When the Skylar Beauty Trial Set came up during Cyber Week, I jumped at the chance to try it out. Skylar is a clean beauty brand and its perfumes are hypoallergenic, vegan, and cruelty-free. The samples in the sale pack include Peach Fields, Vanilla Sky, Lime Sands, Salt Air, and Coconut Cove. I like that the collection is made of simple individual scents that can be paired for more complexity. This winter, I'm looking forward to experimenting with layering Vanilla Sky and Salt Air. Skylar rarely goes on sale, and even in the last few days, we've seen two different sale prices. Right now, you can get the trial set for $12.50, which is the best price we've seen all year. Lily Alig I've tested dozens of robots for our best robot vacuum guide, and one of my all-time favorite vacs is the Bissell SpinWave. It was one of the top picks in our guide for a while, but it's gone in and out of stock over the years, and the price fluctuates dramatically. I'd look elsewhere at its usual $400 price, but at its Cyber Monday special of $145, I strongly recommend it. What sets the Bissell SpinWave apart is its mopping performance. It features spinning mopheads that scrub the floor rather than just move the mess around. The vacuuming performance was also impressive, cleaning up most of the flour, kitty litter, coffee grounds, and pet hair I set out for testing. I especially recommend the Bissell SpinWave to pet lovers. It's great for cleaning up after pets, but it lacks obstacle avoidance in today's high-end robot vacuums. Still, you won't find a better option for automating your floor cleaning at this price point. James Brains Among the best Cyber Monday Apple deals, the Beats Studio Buds are an exceptional budget-to-mid-range wireless earbud option. The Amazon deal for 47% off matches the model's record-low price. I've had the same pair of Beats Studio Buds since 2021. They're a resilient product that has survived myriad forms of water and drop damage while retaining the same reliable, bass-heavy sound. I should note that the Studio Buds are far from the best noise-canceling headphones. I've since upgraded to our guide's top pick for in-ear noise-cancellation, the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra Earbuds (which might also be worth your while at 23% off), to more adequately drown out the din of New York City's streets. However, I've kept the Studio Buds as a trusted backup pair and have come to appreciate their seamless pairing with Apple products relative to the Bose pair's occasionally finicky integration. In certain instances, I prefer the Beats' compact size and fit, even if it sacrifices sound quality compared to the high-end pair. For $80, though, you're sure to get your money's worth. John Lynch Winter is in full swing in Michigan, with wind chills remaining stubbornly in the teens. Yet, I'm just as stubborn when it comes to turning up the thermostat. Why should I crank the heat when I can keep it at a reasonable 64 degrees and just use a space heater if I get cold? This is where the Lasko MyHeat Personal Mini Space Heater comes in. Typically an already-affordable $25, the Lasko MyHeat is marked down to $17 for Cyber Monday. With a flip of the switch, I have instant warm air keeping me comfy at my desk. It occupies minimal space in my cluttered work area and operates quietly, so I can keep it running during meetings. I tested it for our best space heater guide, and it only increased the temperature in my 100-square-foot office by 2.5 degrees. However, it's not meant to heat whole rooms; instead, it offers a personal blast of hot air. If you want extra warmth without the added utility costs of heating your whole living area, I recommend spending the $17 on the Lasko MyHeat space heater deal. James Brains Bombas' massive Cyber Monday sale means everything's 25% off with code "BIGHOLIDAY25." You can feel good about stocking up because Bombas donates one pair of socks to charity for each one purchased, so by shopping tonight, you'll be ahead on your good deed for Giving Tuesday. The latest Bombas style I'm into is the cozy faux sherpa Sunday Slippers. I slide into them first thing in the morning, and they stay on as I get ready for the day, thanks to a raised rear around the heel cup. Their midsoles are made of a plush layer of memory foam laid over an EVA footbed, so the foam won't collapse the more you wear them. Learn why its socks are worth the try in our full Bombas socks review, and check out our guide to the best Bombas Cyber Monday deals. Gabrielle Chase The 2024 MacBook Pro running on the M4 Pro processor comes with 24GB RAM — 6GB more than the 2023 version. Today, the 2024 Pro is $250 off. It's an ideal machine for those who need untamed power in a portable package. The 2023 version is also on sale this Cyber Monday, but it's only $50 less with its deal, so I'd recommend going for the 2024 model. If you're looking for a powerhouse with a more modest price, the 2022 MacBook Air running on the M2 processor with 16GB of RAM is a rare bargain at $800, which is $200 off Apple's full price. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's an "older" model — Apple's M processors have incredible longevity and performance. The newer MacBook Air that runs on the M3 processor is $100 more with its deal, but we don't think the returns are significant enough for the extra money, at least not for those looking for the best value. The latest 15-inch MacBook Air M3 with 16GB RAM for $200 off makes a very tempting case. Its 15-inch display is a tangible upgrade, and the previous generation model is a bad deal with its 8GB of RAM, even if it's $300 off — you should get the latest M3 15-inch model for the newer processor and twice the RAM. Antonio Villas-Boas I wish I had waited until Cyber Monday to purchase the Monos Check-In Large suitcase. You could snag this hard-case check-in bag from one of the best luggage brands for as little as $251, regularly $355. This is the largest version of its standard check-in bag. The deeper savings are only available for select colorways. Monos' durable suitcases have a sleek look similar to Away, another popular luggage maker. I found the spinner wheels, zipper, and handle to perform well. Indeed, when my colleagues tested Monos' carry-on bags, they found them to be some of the best options at their price. That means a Monos sale is worth every penny. The best thing about Monos is that they offer a 100-day trial and free shipping. Provided there isn't damage or usage, you can return a product if it isn't to your liking. Besides Cyber Monday deals, Monos has discounts of up to 40% on select luggage and travel gear sitewide when you use the code CYBERWEEK. Les Shu If you're looking to elevate your camping experience, Solo Stove is offering 50% off its Campfire Gear Kit. The set normally sells for $200 but is down to $100, thanks to being one of many Solo Stove products discounted throughout its site. The Campfire stove works similarly to two of our top-tested recommendations in our best fire pit buying guide: the Solo Stove Bonfire and Solo Stove Mesa. This kit includes the basics: the Campfire camping stove, two pots, a tripod to hang a pot, and a carrying case. As someone who plans to camp more often, I decided the Campfire Gear Kit is a great way to get into cooking outdoors. The stove and pots are lightweight and easy to pack, so I wouldn't need to bring heavier camping cookware or propane gas tanks. While waiting for the fire to burn out, it can double as a small fire pit for making s'mores after dinner. The Bonfire and Mesa fire pits are also on sale, as are other fire pits, pizza ovens, camping stoves, and more outdoor products. It's Solo Stove's biggest sale of the year, so it's a good time to check out its camping and backyard gear. Les Shu As an only-on-New-Years-and-at-weddings drinker, I love when our team covers non-alcoholic spirits and beverages. Our resident whiskey expert, James Brains, has literally traveled up and down the Kentucky bourbon trail developing his palette. Monday is one of his favorite brands for non-alcoholic spirits. During Cyber Week, Monday is offering 30% off everything. The typical $45 price tag is worth it, but $15 off makes it even more compelling. Though we haven't tried the zero-alcohol gin or mezcal yet, we have high hopes based on our experience with the whiskey. James Brains called it "evocative of tootsie rolls" with a pleasant finish. In his blind taste test, the Monday Old Fashioned was the best and closest to the real thing. All the Monday bottles are gorgeous and great as holiday gifts. Shop the bundles or single bottles while the sale lasts. Lily Alig Since my wife's Apple Watch Series 5 started running out of battery before bed, I originally planned on swapping the battery out. I realized that the Apple Watch Series 10 came with so many upgrades that it felt worth buying that instead, especially with the $70 off Cyber Monday discount. My review of the Series 10 is coming, but I already know I love it: the new slim and lightweight design, the latest Vitals feature support in watchOS 11, major performance upgrade, Crash Detection, and fast-charge ability are hits for me and will be for my wife. Plus, she'll finally be able to track her sleep — something she couldn't manage with her old Apple Watch's battery without topping it off just before bed. On a $400 product, $70 might not seem like much of a discount, but it's pretty good for an Apple device that was just released in September. It's the best Apple Watch for most people, and it's going to make a neat, unplanned Christmas present. Antonio Villas-Boas When I research which stylish clothing our readers are most interested in, I also test to make sure they're actually comfortable. The Quince Ultra Stretch Ponte Wide Leg Pants are some of my favorite stretchy work pants I've found — they're from a lightweight Ponte fabric that makes me feel like I'm wearing leggings at work, and only to the untrained eye do they not look like slacks. They come in two inseams and six colors (which may be worth stocking up on while they're on sale for $15 off at $34.90). This pair runs short, so get the 32-inch if you're between lengths. You'll want to be sure of the fit, because the main caveat with the best Quince Cyber Monday deals is that they're non-returnable. Learn more about which Quince's styles we've tried in our full Quince review. Gabrielle Chase. I've tested over 100 mattresses for our best mattress guide, and there's one that blew me away — and I wish I could sleep on it every night — is the Tempur-Pedic Cloud. Right now, it's marked down to $1,399 for a queen, plus you get two free pillows. The all-foam Cloud is Tempur-Pedic's most affordable mattress, which means it's the least you'll pay to sleep on the company's amazing signature foam. I love the Tempur material because it contours to the curves of my body to keep my spine perfectly aligned while relieving pressure points. While testing the Cloud, I fell asleep within minutes each night. This is the mattress I'd buy if I weren't testing new ones every few weeks. The Tempur-Cloud is marked 30% off a few times throughout the year, but I've never seen it marked lower, so if you're looking to upgrade your sleep experience, I'd act on this deal now. With its risk-free home trial, you can return it within 90 days if you don't like it. Check out my full Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress review. James Brains. I scan thousands of deals over the course of the five-day shopping event we in product journalism (sort of) affectionately call "the Turkey Five" and while I see lots of great deals, there's rarely one that stops me in my tracks so abruptly that I have to share it with all my friends. For me, this year, that was Cuyana's sale — specifically its 20% discount on the never discounted System Tote. We named the System Tote the best tote bag we tested because it's chic, durable, and has a clever organization system (hence the name) that we haven't seen in other bags. Instead of a standard array of pockets and accessories, you customize the tote with ad-ons that suit your needs and each component snaps in and out. Not carrying a laptop today? Snap the optional laptop case out and gain back the interior space. One thing that really attracted me to the bag was that it's the nicest-looking tote I've seen that has an optional crossbody strap. Business Insider Reviews' executive editor Sally Kaplan has had a System Tote for about 4 years now, and it's her go-to bag for vacations, flights, weekend trips, and long car rides. "It fits an unbelievable amount of stuff, but it also doesn't look floppy or silly if I just put a few things in it," she says. "On a usual vacation, this bag will hold two pairs of shoes, my giant Dyson blow dryer, a hair brush, my toiletry and makeup bags, a scarf or sweater, and a couple of snacks." The downside is the System Tote is an investment at its normal price, especially if you want a lot of add-on components. I was holding out hope for a sale, but I was shocked to see Cuyana offer a discount this good. Past sales from the brand usually hover around 15% off, if they have a sale at all. I'm not the only one who thinks it's a great deal: there's only one sale color of the 13-inch tote and two colors of the 16-inch tote left in stock (fortunately, they're great colors). Cuyana's whole sale is worth taking a look at, especially since it likely won't come around for another year. We rounded up our picks for the best Cyber Monday Cuyana deals, so you have the absolute highlights. For more about what we love in this brand, check out our Cuyana review. Lauren Savoie. As Business Insider's air fryer expert, I've tested over 60 models for our best air fryer guide. There's one that I consistently recommend when people are considering buying this relatively new appliance: the Beautiful Touchscreen Air Fryer. Right now, it's marked down to an all-time low $59 at Walmart. Beautiful is Drew Barrymore's brand, sold exclusively at Walmart. I love it because it cooks evenly and quickly at a budget price. Though only two colors are on sale, white and Starry Night Blue, you can pick from ten colors, so there's sure to be one that matches your kitchen's decor. The six-quart basket of the Beautiful air fryer holds a lot of food for an air fryer at this price point. I cooked a pound of chicken wings to crispy perfection in 16 minutes. Frozen fries were restaurant-quality in 13. Plus, clean-up was a breeze. You can quickly wipe off the grime from the nonstick interior or pop it in the dishwasher. If you've been on the fence about air-frying, I strongly recommend you take advantage of this deal. With Walmart's 90-day return policy, what have you got to lose? James Brains. That's not a typo, nor is it an introductory offer for a month or two. This bundle gets you Disney+ and Hulu for $2.99 a month for an entire year. It's a genuine mic-dropper of a deal for two excellent streaming services. The caveat, of course, being that this is for the ad-supported tiers of both services. Individually, they're $9.99 a month, but the year-round Duo Bundle merges them into a $10.99 a month offer, so going down to $2.99 is a big deal for sure. You'll need to be a new customer to get this excellent rate, and you're not obliged to keep it for a year as it's a rolling one-month contract. If you let it keep rolling, the price will go up to $10.99 next December (or higher if prices go up by then). My advice: cancel a month early next year, and you'll be eligible for next year's Black Friday promo deal again. Brendan Griffiths. Like Black Friday before it, Cyber Monday sales have been disappointing for anyone looking to pick up an Xbox Series X. Unlike the PS5, Microsoft hasn't bothered with a Slim version and is generally still charging the same price it did for the console at launch over four years ago. However, it has just launched an all-digital Series X in white. And it's $100 cheaper than the disc-based console, thanks to a Cyber Monday deal knocking $50 off. So you can get the white Series X, with no disc drive for $398 at Walmart. That's still a lot of money, given the digital PS5 Slim is only $374 today. That said, if you are happy to forgo physical media, this might be tempting. The excellent Xbox Game Pass is a great subscription to fully embrace all-digital on Microsoft's console as it's absolutely packed with great new games. Brendan Griffiths. While some end dates for Cyber Monday deals are up in the air, Max has confirmed on its site that this massive deal will expire today. It could be midnight PT or maybe even ET, but it's into the final hours for sure. The 70% discount applies to the ad-supported tier, but for the next six months, you'll pay just $2.99 a month for Max, down from the usual $9.99. Given the quality of the shows on offer, this is one of the best Cyber Monday streaming deals we've ever seen. You can cancel before the six months are up if you wish. The offer is only open to new and returning subscribers. Brendan Griffiths. Looking for a pillow upgrade? The Coop's Original Adjustable Pillow is 25% off, the lowest price we've ever seen it go for. Usually $75, it automatically discounts to $56.25 at the checkout at Coop's site. This is the same pillow we put right at the top of our best pillows buying guide. The memory foam inside is shredded and you're encouraged to remove or add more (extra is supplied) to get just the right level of support required, so it's a great match for all sleeper styles. I've just ordered one myself after hearing multiple colleagues rate it so highly (and a bunch of other sites' pillow guides), even if part of me dies inside for spending $56 on a pillow. But seeing as the $20 memory foam one I bought at Amazon in July already feels increasingly flat, it's time to try a proper upgrade. Coop has a wider sale for other pillows and bedding with up to 50% off. You won't see the reduced prices on the item's listing page, just the percentage that's coming off at checkout, which is an odd way of trying to convert a sale, but there we go. Brendan Griffiths. I'd spent a lot of time before Cyber Monday weighing up a new TV. Having just moved to the US, I'm rebooting my entire setup which means picking up a TV and game consoles all over again. Having left an LG C2 behind in the UK, I was weighing up an OLED like the LG C4, Samsung 90D, or maybe even save a few bucks via the LG B4 line. But then I started reading the reviews of the Hisense 7N range and fell down the comparison video rabbit hole reading up on how its Mini-LED 144hz display with Dolby Vision is competitive with TVs more than twice its price. TLDR reader, I bought the 55-inch model for $479 at Best Buy - about half of what I'd budgeted for one of the others mentioned above. It's sat next to me right now, still boxed and unwatched, because I'm here, talking to you. Anyway, if you're tempted, check out; you can see this TV with hundreds smashed off the price of the 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch models at Best Buy. Amazon's deals are $3 cheaper right now, but there's a long wait for delivery on all of them. Want more options? Check out Steven's full list of the best Cyber Monday TV deals. Brendan Griffiths. The regular deal price we see during flagship sale days has finally been beaten. That's quite surprising as the usual discounts from $250 down to $170-$160 already seemed generous enough, especially for an Apple product. Well, we have an all-time low price today: the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro are $154 at Amazon. Despite not having a proper upgrade in a few years, these remain some of the best earbuds on the market, with quality audio and excellent noise-canceling. This is for the newer USB-C model. If you have the original AirPods Pro 2, we wouldn't bother with these, as you're only getting a different charging port and some modest dust resistance. The sound quality and fit remain the same. Brendan Griffiths. Yes, the digital and disc-drive models of the PS5 Slim are still in stock at Amazon. The original non-slim PS5 is no longer in production, so this is the one you want. PS5 stock has been in and out all weekend, but the same record-low prices have been available on the console alone and in a new bundle with free Fortnite DLC. Even if you don't want the Fortnite content, snap that one up anyway, as it's not costing you anything extra. The digital model is down to $374 (down from $450), and the disc-drive version is $75 off at a reduced price of $424. Brendan Griffiths. Jump to

Title: Promotions Drive Black Friday Weekend Gains, Retailers Stay Upbeat on Season

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily A spike in online shopping and sufficient turnouts in the malls, outlets and urban shopping districts over Black Friday weekend portend a healthy stretch ahead in the days leading to Christmas. So far, so good. After weeks of early discounting culminating on Black Friday, U.S. retailers saw enough gift shopping over the weekend to buoy hopes of meeting or beating their holiday sales goals. While traffic in stores on Black Friday and Saturday was slightly down to flat from a year ago, online traffic was robust. As consumers got into the holiday spending spirit, demand overcame inflation and cost of living concerns, at least temporarily. Purchasing on Friday and Saturday was also driven by the strong stock market, where on Friday the Dow closed at a record 44,910.65 points; less uncertainty due to the presidential election being decided, and weather conditions conducive to hitting the malls. Temperature drops on Friday and Saturday spurred sales of outerwear and winter accessories, which lagged through the fall; activewear also fared well. Retailers are generally managing inventories better, and utilizing AI more to gauge demand and generate flash sales. You May Also Like Related Articles Culture News Bath & Body Works' Candle Day Is Nearly Here -- Sale Hours, Deals and Everything You Need to Know Home The Happy Purchase Shopping List Momentum should continue on Cyber Monday, which is expected to drive $13.5 billion in sales in the U.S., up from $12.6 billion in 2023, according to Salesforce. Globally, Cyber Monday is seen driving $51 billion in online sales, up from $48.4 billion on Cyber Monday in 2023, Salesforce said. The software giant also reported that during the first half of Cyber Week, retailers using GenAI in their service experience saw a 9 percent higher conversion rate compared to retailers who are not. Another software giant, Adobe, reported that on Black Friday U.S. consumers spent a $10.8 billion online, up 10.2 percent year-over-year. Between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., $11.3 million was spent online every minute on Black Friday, with toys, jewelry, appliances, personal care, apparel and electronics among the top-performing categories, Adobe reported. “Crossing the $10 billion mark is a big e-commerce milestone for Black Friday, for a day that in the past was more anchored toward in-store shopping,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights. “And with consumers getting more comfortable with everything from mobile shopping to chatbots, we have tailwinds that can prop up online growth moving forward.” Mastercard reported that U.S. store and online sales on Black Friday, excluding automotive sales and unadjusted for inflation, were up 3.4 percent. “Black Friday was a good indicator of how the holiday season is positively shaping up,” said Michelle Meyer, chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute. “Our real-time insights show that consumers are comfortably in the gift-giving spirit as price reductions and deals occur across sectors, supporting budgets for holiday shopping.” Mastercard indicated that online retail sales on Black Friday increased 14.6 percent, while in-store sales were up just 0.7 percent, compared to Black Friday last year. Jewelry, electronics and apparel were cited as the top categories, with particular strength in apparel e-commerce. “Shoppers are making the most of seasonal deals and enjoying a balance of experiences spending and gifts for all loved ones,” said Steve Sadove, senior adviser for Mastercard and former chairman and chief executive officer of Saks Inc. “They’re more strategic in their shopping, though, prioritizing promotions that they believe hold the greatest value — opening their wallets, but with more intentional distribution.” “Black Friday is no longer a day. It’s a season,” said Stephen Yalof, president and CEO of Tanger, the Greensboro, N.C.-based operator of 39 outlet centers and one lifestyle center. “The traffic starts building in late October/early November, and Tanger has been promoting Black Friday every day in November with different brands and sales to keep things exciting. Our traffic numbers this weekend beat last year. People are shopping in large groups. The whole family is coming out and shoppers are looking for deals.” Coach, Ralph Lauren, Columbia, American Eagle, Aerie, Viori, Nike, Adidas and Gap Inc. were among the busiest outlets in Tanger centers over the weekend, Yalof said. Asked if the deals were bigger this year than last year, Yalof replied, “I think so. The discounting started earlier this year than last year and a lot of the brands in some instances have better deals than last year, and on selected items. Yeti was on sale. I’ve never seen Yeti on sale.” The consumer mindset, he said, is to “shop now and come in early” for fear that a particular product would sell out. “There’s a frenzied-ness I haven’t seen in recent years. I think it’s fueled by the shorter selling season and the weather just turning cold.” Data from major software firms indicated that traffic at stores are down slightly from last year, but Yalof said, “Outlets are a different story. I visited a couple of full-price centers also and there were plenty of cars there, but the aspirational outlet shopper is looking for deals and they are lining up in our centers.” “Everything we got from our malls is really positive,” said Stephen Lebovitz, president and CEO of CBL & Associates Properties, the Chattanooga, Tenn.-based real estate investment trust, when asked to comment on Friday’s and Saturday’s business. “We had really good crowds early. The stores offering good promotions had lines. The parking lots were full by mid-morning and stayed busy all day Friday.” Lebovitz said the Wednesday before Thanksgiving saw a stronger turnout than the same day a year ago. “People were hitting it hard given the short holiday season.” Each year there’s typically a lull in business after Cyber Monday until 10 days to two weeks before Christmas. “Because of the shorter calendar, we don’t think there will be as much of a lull this year,” Lebovitz said. Stores selling activewear, casual apparel and cosmetics, and those offering promotions and good discounts fared the best, Lebovitz said, noting that consumers have been hit by “a barrage of emails and texts” from retailers. CBL has a total of 94 malls, and outlet, lifestyle and open-air centers, primarily in the Southeast and Midwest. “Things were good, not great,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. He said the weekend marked a return to shopping “normalcy” in the aftermath of COVID-19 and the subsequent spending splurge from federal assistance putting money into consumers’ pockets. Americans, Johnson said, are “shopping with a balance of wants and needs.” Johnson said transaction velocity was highest at Costco, Walmart, Amazon, Gap Inc. and Urban Outfitters. Category-wise, athleisure was a standout, with Lululemon, Viori, Alo and Free People performing well in the category, Johnson said. He also said that the promotional pace has been quite similar to last year, with discounts typically offering 30 percent off, with some up to 40 percent and select goods at the 50 percent mark. Almost all the retail promotions so far have been pre-planned. “There has not been any fire-sale pricing,” Johnson said. At Elyse Walker, which operates six Elyse Walker designer stores and two Towne specialty stores, “Black Friday was a very healthy kick-off to holiday shopping,” said Summer Holl, president. “While we ran a Black Friday weekend promo that drove motivated traffic — additional 20 percent off markdown in store and online — we had a great mix of full-price selling and appointments as well. Our Los Angeles flagship was up triple digits to Black Friday last year and we saw a 10 percent comp increase in our New York City flagship. Footwear, both sale and full price, was a top seller. Shoppers were looking for buy now, wear now deals, knits and outerwear. Full-price selling was driven by new designer deliveries from Celine, Loewe, Bottega Veneta, Khaite and Altuzarra.” “I’m beyond happy,” said Chris Riccobono, founder of Untuckit, which operates 89 stores across the U.S. as well as a robust online business. “It was amazing.” He said the company launched its planned promotional sale a week early this year and was worried that the aggressive stance of some competitors might take a bite out of Untuckit’s business. That turned out not to be the case. “We held the same discount as we have for the past 13 years,” Riccobono said, with select items being offered at 50 and 60 percent off regular retail. “We comped up pretty significantly both in our stores and online. They’re not always in sync, but in this case, it was pretty even . . . . Everything was great last week — maybe [consumers] were just waiting for the election to end.” Bestsellers included the men’s wrinkle-free Veneto shirt program, Hemsworth flannel shirt, wrinkle-free Cadetto shirt, the Lawrence and Cord shirts, the Archer sweater flannel and the Traveler pant program. While Untuckit is primarily a men’s brand, the women’s Bella program and the Lexie Sequin shirtdress were top performers. Commenting on the business ahead, Riccobono said, “It’s held for eight days in a row so we feel like it’ll be a great holiday season.” “Our full-price retail was strong the last month and we experienced the same trend during Black Friday,” said Ken Ohashi, CEO of Brooks Brothers. The company’s stores and e-commerce performed similarly well. “They were neck and neck,” he said, “And we have significantly less clearance than last year. We’re pretty clean and our gross margin and maintained margin are up, so we’re feeling good.” As a result, the company moved some dollars previously spent on affiliate marketing to more traditional advertising such as billboards, television and out-of-home ads. “It’s helping us,” he said. Among the top sellers were “holiday dressing” pieces and formalwear, which were the focus in this year’s holiday campaign. Elevated sportswear in sweaters and knits also did well. Despite the compressed calendar, Ohashi expects the strong performance to continue through December. “The stores that we recently expanded or are in new markets all performed very well,” he said, pointing to the larger Rockefeller Center store in New York City, as well as the Wisconsin Avenue unit in Washington, D.C., and Newbury Street in Boston. “They all performed well,” he said. “Newbury Street, in particular, has been on fire and four out of five people there have never shopped with us before.” As a result, Ohashi said he’s “not stressed going into the first quarter in terms of inventory,” and believes 2025 will also be strong for Brooks Brothers. Rhone had a strong holiday kickoff, too. “We had record-setting days in all channels,” said CEO Nate Checketts, who hit stores this weekend in Boston while his cofounder and brother Ben hit stores in Los Angeles. He said that in addition to strength in a new menswear product called the Coldspell Commuter Pant, which features a brushed flannel lining for warmth, Rhone was pleased with the performance of its recently launched women’s collection. “We saw higher ‘mixed baskets,’ of people buying both men’s and women’s,” Checketts said. Rhone stuck to its planned promotions of 30 percent off on orders of $300 or more. “We’ve run the same promotions for the last four years and we did the same this year,” he said. “Consumers are starting to come back in a stronger way after a year of uncertainty and a post-election cycle. It’s been a crazy couple of years.” But with the strength of Black Friday weekend as a backdrop he’s hopeful the momentum will be “pulled forward” to Cyber Monday and the remainder of the season. Bob Mitchell, co-CEO of Mitchells Stores, which operates luxury units under the Mitchells, Richards, Wilkes Bashford and Marios names on the East and West Coasts, said that despite Thanksgiving being a week later than last year, business in 2024 is very strong. “We just capped off a record, double-digit November and we’re off to a double-digit start for the holiday season,” he said. “Men’s has come on strong in the last few weeks,” particularly tailored clothing — especially sport coats — and sportswear. New spring deliveries have also started to check, he said. In women’s, “while ready-to-wear is up, we’re also seeing nice growth in handbags and jewelry, which has been the star.” Top luxury performers at Mitchells Stores were Brunello Cucinelli, Zegna, Loro Piana, Brioni, Canali, Akris and The Row while Fedeli and Baldessari did well in the mid-tier. Although reluctant to characterize the season as a success this early, Mitchell is upbeat. “The real numbers don’t start for us until 10 days before, so this could all be a mirage,” he said with a laugh. “But the customer is in a very good mood with how the [stock] market is performing and Bitcoin. So we expect it will be a good season.” Shopify merchants saw $5 billion in Black Friday sales this year, up 22 percent from $4.1 billion a year ago. Sales peaked at $4.6 million per minute at 12:01 p.m. EST on Friday and the average cart carried $111.12 worth of goods, driven by sales of tops, cosmetics, fitness and nutrition, pants and activewear. Los Angeles, New York, London, San Francisco and Miami were among the platform’s top cities for the day. As of Sunday morning — and headed toward Cyber Monday — Shopify was seeing about 12,500 orders and sales of more than $1.2 million per minute. Shopify powers more than 2 million online merchants. Target stores opened at 6 a.m. on Black Friday, but shoppers in some places started lining up as early as 11:30 the night before. The big-box store sought to draw consumers with Taylor Swift exclusives, including “The Official Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book,” as well as versions of her album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” on CD and vinyl. As some locations sold out of at least part of their Taylor Swift goodies by 10 a.m., Target looked to steer the traffic to other parts of the store with discounts, including 40 percent off for fleece and 50 percent off for some women’s, kids and men’s looks. At Talbots, tops and sweaters were big sellers, due partially to a Black Friday special of $29.50 ”FestiviTees” for holiday-themed knit tops that generated 22,000 units in sales, according to a spokesperson. For gifting, sleepwear especially plaid flannel pajamas, were top sellers, along with down puffers and fashion vests. At Loft, consumers were favoring cozy styles including novelty and shimmery designs. Everyday crewneck sweaters, soft sweat sets, puffer coats, vests, and Lou & Grey loungewear were among the best sellers. While most retailers were closed Thanksgiving, Loft’s Times Square location was open and had customers waiting on line before the opening. Soma’s strong performers were “Cool Nights PJ sets,” loungewear, and bras, as well as a Soma printed tote bag gift with $100 purchase in stores only. Customers were “definitely ready” to shop for gifts and for themselves, according to the spokesperson. Shoppers at White House Black Market favored denim, sequins, faux fur, leather and novelty pants for work and holiday parties. Bustiers, embellished sweaters and party dresses were popular in red, purple, and black and white. Dick’s Sporting Goods flagged a handful of bestsellers, for example, in men’s, Nike’s full-zip Windrunner hoodie, On Cloud 5 shoes, and Carhartt’s K288 hoodie. In women’s, Nike’s Phoenix fleece oversize sweatshirt, Hoka’s women’s Clifton 9 running shoes and Calia soft scuba joggers, were cited. The weekend saw up to 30 percent off select Nike apparel, such as with Nike club hoodies, sweatshirts and joggers. Weather through the U.S. this past weekend was the coldest in more than 25 years, according to Evan Gold, executive vice president of Planalytics. And Black Friday was the coldest on a national basis since 2007, Gold added. Over the weekend, “New York City and a lot of other major markets in the Northeast were below freezing for the first time this season,” pushing demand for outerwear, sweaters, hats and gloves up 5 to 15 percent,” Gold said. New York City’s average temperature was 40 degrees versus 44 last year. Chicago averaged 23 degrees versus 33 last year, and Minneapolis was 16 degrees versus 27 degrees. Even Atlanta was colder, averaging 45 degrees versus 51 degrees last year. A few cities in the South Central and West were slightly warmer this weekend, with Los Angeles and Phoenix both averaging 65 degrees versus 62 last year. “It’s definitely going to be a colder December,” Gold said. “Last December was the warmest ever recorded.” New York City is expected to average 30 degrees, or 10 degrees colder than a year ago; Chicago will average in the low- to mid-20s, or about 18 degrees colder than last year. Jessica Ramírez, senior research analyst at Jane Hali & Associates, said retailers started to “bluntly” lay out Black Friday deals in early November, when warmer weather was restraining sales of outerwear. Because the season started early — as has been the case for a number of years — she said price discounts ticked up only slightly on Black Friday. And all the holiday price promotions mean a little less given the impact of inflation across the economy. “That’s just going to make the consumers feel more selective,” Ramírez said. “I don’t think this is going to be a great holiday season in general for retail. I think it’s still going to be flat [when] you adjust inflation into it.” It’s a pricing dynamic that plays to the strengths of Walmart and the off-price channel, which Ramírez said would be winners. But value isn’t just about price. She said Ralph Lauren, Levi’s, Hoka and On — brands that have been on the rise and are playing to a strong area of the market — are well positioned and are going into the holiday season with only minimal promotions. “The retail sector is being run much better than it has been in many years, in terms of inventory, in terms of price, in terms of promotions and even leaning into categories that make sense for the consumer today,” Ramírez said. In a good sign for fashion, “There is still that shift of people going more into office,” Ramírez said. “So apparel might have a better season.” According to a report on Black Friday from consulting firm Ankura, “Stores like Lululemon, Nike, Gap and Athleta were extremely busy; Columbia, North Face and Converse were also busy with deeper discounts.” Ankura also reported that Coach, Ugg and Michael Kors performed well, benefiting from discounts and consumer interest in luxury deals. Regarding department stores, Ankura reported, “While some anchor stores like Macy’s successfully attracted shoppers with organized and well-staffed environments, others such as Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom struggled with lower traffic and less effective promotional strategies. In general, those with clear and substantial discounts seemed to fare better.” Meanwhile, “Beauty stores ran aggressive promotions and had the traffic to prove it. Where they appeared to fail, was in the ability to restock the shelves during the day. By mid-day Sephora and Ulta Beauty shelves were stripped clean and have to imagine missed a lot of sales.” — With contributions from Lisa Lockwood, Evan Clark and Rosemary Feitelberg Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Title: Promotions Drive Black Friday Weekend Gains, Retailers Stay Upbeat on Season

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily A spike in online shopping and sufficient turnouts in the malls, outlets and urban shopping districts over Black Friday weekend portend a healthy stretch ahead in the days leading to Christmas. So far, so good. After weeks of early discounting culminating on Black Friday, U.S. retailers saw enough gift shopping over the weekend to buoy hopes of meeting or beating their holiday sales goals. While traffic in stores on Black Friday and Saturday was slightly down to flat from a year ago, online traffic was robust. As consumers got into the holiday spending spirit, demand overcame inflation and cost of living concerns, at least temporarily. Purchasing on Friday and Saturday was also driven by the strong stock market, where on Friday the Dow closed at a record 44,910.65 points; less uncertainty due to the presidential election being decided, and weather conditions conducive to hitting the malls. Temperature drops on Friday and Saturday spurred sales of outerwear and winter accessories, which lagged through the fall; activewear also fared well. Retailers are generally managing inventories better, and utilizing AI more to gauge demand and generate flash sales. You May Also Like Related Articles Culture News Bath & Body Works' Candle Day Is Nearly Here -- Sale Hours, Deals and Everything You Need to Know Home The Happy Purchase Shopping List Momentum should continue on Cyber Monday, which is expected to drive $13.5 billion in sales in the U.S., up from $12.6 billion in 2023, according to Salesforce. Globally, Cyber Monday is seen driving $51 billion in online sales, up from $48.4 billion on Cyber Monday in 2023, Salesforce said. The software giant also reported that during the first half of Cyber Week, retailers using GenAI in their service experience saw a 9 percent higher conversion rate compared to retailers who are not. Another software giant, Adobe, reported that on Black Friday U.S. consumers spent a $10.8 billion online, up 10.2 percent year-over-year. Between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., $11.3 million was spent online every minute on Black Friday, with toys, jewelry, appliances, personal care, apparel and electronics among the top-performing categories, Adobe reported. “Crossing the $10 billion mark is a big e-commerce milestone for Black Friday, for a day that in the past was more anchored toward in-store shopping,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights. “And with consumers getting more comfortable with everything from mobile shopping to chatbots, we have tailwinds that can prop up online growth moving forward.” Mastercard reported that U.S. store and online sales on Black Friday, excluding automotive sales and unadjusted for inflation, were up 3.4 percent. “Black Friday was a good indicator of how the holiday season is positively shaping up,” said Michelle Meyer, chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute. “Our real-time insights show that consumers are comfortably in the gift-giving spirit as price reductions and deals occur across sectors, supporting budgets for holiday shopping.” Mastercard indicated that online retail sales on Black Friday increased 14.6 percent, while in-store sales were up just 0.7 percent, compared to Black Friday last year. Jewelry, electronics and apparel were cited as the top categories, with particular strength in apparel e-commerce. “Shoppers are making the most of seasonal deals and enjoying a balance of experiences spending and gifts for all loved ones,” said Steve Sadove, senior adviser for Mastercard and former chairman and chief executive officer of Saks Inc. “They’re more strategic in their shopping, though, prioritizing promotions that they believe hold the greatest value — opening their wallets, but with more intentional distribution.” “Black Friday is no longer a day. It’s a season,” said Stephen Yalof, president and CEO of Tanger, the Greensboro, N.C.-based operator of 39 outlet centers and one lifestyle center. “The traffic starts building in late October/early November, and Tanger has been promoting Black Friday every day in November with different brands and sales to keep things exciting. Our traffic numbers this weekend beat last year. People are shopping in large groups. The whole family is coming out and shoppers are looking for deals.” Coach, Ralph Lauren, Columbia, American Eagle, Aerie, Viori, Nike, Adidas and Gap Inc. were among the busiest outlets in Tanger centers over the weekend, Yalof said. Asked if the deals were bigger this year than last year, Yalof replied, “I think so. The discounting started earlier this year than last year and a lot of the brands in some instances have better deals than last year, and on selected items. Yeti was on sale. I’ve never seen Yeti on sale.” The consumer mindset, he said, is to “shop now and come in early” for fear that a particular product would sell out. “There’s a frenzied-ness I haven’t seen in recent years. I think it’s fueled by the shorter selling season and the weather just turning cold.” Data from major software firms indicated that traffic at stores are down slightly from last year, but Yalof said, “Outlets are a different story. I visited a couple of full-price centers also and there were plenty of cars there, but the aspirational outlet shopper is looking for deals and they are lining up in our centers.” “Everything we got from our malls is really positive,” said Stephen Lebovitz, president and CEO of CBL & Associates Properties, the Chattanooga, Tenn.-based real estate investment trust, when asked to comment on Friday’s and Saturday’s business. “We had really good crowds early. The stores offering good promotions had lines. The parking lots were full by mid-morning and stayed busy all day Friday.” Lebovitz said the Wednesday before Thanksgiving saw a stronger turnout than the same day a year ago. “People were hitting it hard given the short holiday season.” Each year there’s typically a lull in business after Cyber Monday until 10 days to two weeks before Christmas. “Because of the shorter calendar, we don’t think there will be as much of a lull this year,” Lebovitz said. Stores selling activewear, casual apparel and cosmetics, and those offering promotions and good discounts fared the best, Lebovitz said, noting that consumers have been hit by “a barrage of emails and texts” from retailers. CBL has a total of 94 malls, and outlet, lifestyle and open-air centers, primarily in the Southeast and Midwest. “Things were good, not great,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. He said the weekend marked a return to shopping “normalcy” in the aftermath of COVID-19 and the subsequent spending splurge from federal assistance putting money into consumers’ pockets. Americans, Johnson said, are “shopping with a balance of wants and needs.” Johnson said transaction velocity was highest at Costco, Walmart, Amazon, Gap Inc. and Urban Outfitters. Category-wise, athleisure was a standout, with Lululemon, Viori, Alo and Free People performing well in the category, Johnson said. He also said that the promotional pace has been quite similar to last year, with discounts typically offering 30 percent off, with some up to 40 percent and select goods at the 50 percent mark. Almost all the retail promotions so far have been pre-planned. “There has not been any fire-sale pricing,” Johnson said. At Elyse Walker, which operates six Elyse Walker designer stores and two Towne specialty stores, “Black Friday was a very healthy kick-off to holiday shopping,” said Summer Holl, president. “While we ran a Black Friday weekend promo that drove motivated traffic — additional 20 percent off markdown in store and online — we had a great mix of full-price selling and appointments as well. Our Los Angeles flagship was up triple digits to Black Friday last year and we saw a 10 percent comp increase in our New York City flagship. Footwear, both sale and full price, was a top seller. Shoppers were looking for buy now, wear now deals, knits and outerwear. Full-price selling was driven by new designer deliveries from Celine, Loewe, Bottega Veneta, Khaite and Altuzarra.” “I’m beyond happy,” said Chris Riccobono, founder of Untuckit, which operates 89 stores across the U.S. as well as a robust online business. “It was amazing.” He said the company launched its planned promotional sale a week early this year and was worried that the aggressive stance of some competitors might take a bite out of Untuckit’s business. That turned out not to be the case. “We held the same discount as we have for the past 13 years,” Riccobono said, with select items being offered at 50 and 60 percent off regular retail. “We comped up pretty significantly both in our stores and online. They’re not always in sync, but in this case, it was pretty even . . . . Everything was great last week — maybe [consumers] were just waiting for the election to end.” Bestsellers included the men’s wrinkle-free Veneto shirt program, Hemsworth flannel shirt, wrinkle-free Cadetto shirt, the Lawrence and Cord shirts, the Archer sweater flannel and the Traveler pant program. While Untuckit is primarily a men’s brand, the women’s Bella program and the Lexie Sequin shirtdress were top performers. Commenting on the business ahead, Riccobono said, “It’s held for eight days in a row so we feel like it’ll be a great holiday season.” “Our full-price retail was strong the last month and we experienced the same trend during Black Friday,” said Ken Ohashi, CEO of Brooks Brothers. The company’s stores and e-commerce performed similarly well. “They were neck and neck,” he said, “And we have significantly less clearance than last year.

It’s been a crazy couple of years.” But with the strength of Black Friday weekend as a backdrop he’s hopeful the momentum will be “pulled forward” to Cyber Monday and the remainder of the season.

Los Angeles, New York, London, San Francisco and Miami were among the platform’s top cities for the day. As of Sunday morning — and headed toward Cyber Monday — Shopify was seeing about 12,500 orders and sales of more than $1.2 million per minute. Shopify powers more than 2 million online merchants.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Cyber Monday is done. It's finished. The big sales bonanza is through for another year. Hopefully, you were able to bag a bargain or two from the most-wanted items on your shopping list. But it's not all a complete disaster if you missed the sales, as there are dozens of great Cyber Week deals still available – and I've rounded them up here. As a procrastinator myself and a seasoned deals editor, I've gone through today's remaining sales from Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and more and hand-picked the best Cyber Monday deals that are still available and worth your money. The good news is that some excellent offers are still available, with record-low prices on TVs, kitchen gadgets, Apple Watches, robot vacuums, and smart home devices from brands like Sony, Samsung, Bissell, and Ninja. I've been combing through offers for weeks, and I'm only listing worthwhile deals on highly-rated products. You'll want to act fast though, as now the Cyber Monday sales are over I'm not sure how much longer these deals will be available. I'm sure more Christmas sales events will go live at retailers over the coming weeks but this might be your last opportunity of the year to find items discounted for such low prices. Are you looking for a cheap air fryer deal this Cyber Monday? Walmart is offering a massive 50% discount on the top-rated Chefman air fryer, bringing the price down to $50. The eight-quart air fryer features a basket divider, so you can separate food for dual cooking. The LG B4 is one of the most affordable OLED TVs on the market, and Best Buy has the 48-inch model on sale for $699.99. It was $100 less over Cyber Monday but this is still a fantastic price. Its self-lit OLED pixels and Dolby Vision together enhance color and contrast beyond what the average backlit TV can do. Its built-in gaming features and 120Hz refresh rate make it an unbeatable deal for gamers looking for an upgrade. Here it is, folks - the best deal yet on the latest Dell XPS 13. Complete with a brand-new Snapdragon X Elite chipset, this model is capable of not just exceptional day-to-day performance, but also battery life that's simply a cut-above what Windows laptops usually offer. Alongside superb specs, the latest XPS 13 also features a gorgeous lightweight design and a display that's perfect for both work and casual everyday use. This is an incredible price for a pair of wireless on-ear headphones – on sale for just $24.95 at Amazon right now. The JBL Tune 510BT features Wireless Bluetooth 5.0 Streaming, so you can stream music and podcasts and take calls from your device, and you'll enjoy an impressive 40 hours of battery life. It's no t a model we've tested, but the JBL Tune 510BT have over 50,000 positive reviews on Amazon and are one of the best-selling headphones on the site. They also come with JBL's renowned Pure Bass sound. If you need something inexpensive and you need it now, it's hard to argue with this price tag… Apple's best-selling 10.2 iPad with 64GB of storage just dropped to $199 - a new record-low price. While the tablet is an older model, it still packs a 10.2-inch Retina display, and the A13 Bionic chip ensures excellent picture quality and superior performance. According to our Apple iPad 10.2 review, the entry-level tablet can do it all without issue, whether browsing the net, streaming media, doing light work, or playing games. At just $599 - Walmart is practically giving away Apple's MacBook Air. Not only is this an outstanding price for such a powerful laptop that still holds up great for 2024, but this could be the last chance to pick one up now that it's officially discontinued. Don't miss this incredible deal if you're looking for a great bang for the buck MacBook. This might be Amazon's best Cyber Monday deal - Apple's all-new Apple Watch 10 on sale for a new record-low price of $329. The Apple Watch 10 includes upgrades such as Apple's new S10 chipset, sleep apnea detection, depth gauge, and a new design featuring the most advanced display. I don't expect you'll find a better price this year, and this offer is in danger of being sold out. Get the best compact, single-serve blender for under $50 at Walmart's sale ahead of Cyber Monday. This is an ideal solution for your daily smoothie or protein shake. With its built-in handle and sippy cup lid, you'll be ready to make your favorite creation just before leaving the house. The Nespresso Vertuo Pop Plus Deluxe by Breville is on sale for its cheapest price yet. This easy-to-use coffee maker supports multiple types of drinks and sizes, and you can brew these using dedicated recyclable Nespresso pods. The large removable water tank and compact size also add to its convenience. The Ninja Creami ice cream maker will surely be a Cyber Monday best-seller due to its popularity at recent holiday sales, and Walmart has the appliance down to a record-low price. You can make ice cream, milkshakes, and sorbets with a touch of a button and add your favorite mix-ins and flavors. KitchenAid is a mainstay in the Bake Off tent and still the leader when it comes to high-quality stand mixers – but they do come with a hefty upfront cost. This healthy $120 discount on the premium Artisan model definitely takes the sting out, though. It comes with a stainless steel bowl and three attachments for mixing, kneading, and beating – everything the amateur or intermediate baker needs for the kitchen. Amazon's best-selling 43-inch 4-Series 4K smart TV is on sale for $229.99 - a new record-low price. It offers 4K HD resolution, smart capabilities with the Fire operating system, and a voice remote with hands-free Alexa, so you can use your voice to control your TV. Amazon's all-new Fire TV Omni QLED Series is a big step up in the otherwise cheap range of smart TVs. This set boasts premium features, including a QLED display, full-array local dimming, Dolby Vision IQ, and HDR10+ Adaptive support to deliver a high-quality picture for all-around viewing and gaming. A good overall buy for the budget-conscious who don't want to compromise on performance, especially now that it's down to a record-low price of $599.99. The Sony Bravia 8 is back at its lowest price yet ahead of Cyber Monday. As one of the best TVs for sound, it's an ideal choice if you want stellar sound without paying extra for a soundbar. Its OLED screen might not be the brightest of them all, but it still manages to rival the picture quality of its competitors using its brightness-boosting Bravia XP Processor. You can even use it with your gaming console of choice thanks to the two HDMI ports (out of four total) that support 4K/120 Hz gaming. If you're looking for a big-screen budget display, Best Buy has this 75-inch 4K TV on sale for $549.99. This entry-level TV from Samsung packs a solid 'Crystal' UHD 4K processor, an easy-to-use Tizen operating system, and full HDR support all for under $600. That's good value for money if you need a straightforward but capable display for your everyday viewing and media streaming. The Hisense U7N is an affordable mini-LED TV that provides serious bang for your buck, packing great features and performance into a budget package. It supports all HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, comes packed with gaming features, including 4K, 144Hz, and Dolby Vision gaming, and uses Google TV as its smart TV platform. This Cyber Monday deal takes the 75-inch model to under $1,000 – for a TV with this much to offer at this much size, this is a superb deal. Bissell portable carpet cleaners have become the breakout stars at holiday sales like Cyber Monday, and the top-rated Little Green model is currently on sale for $81.49. Perfect for pet owners and parents, the portable carpet cleaner can magically erase spills and stains on carpets, couches, auto interiors, and more. If you're on a budget but still want a high-end vacuum, Dyso's V8 Absolute is a fantastic option at just $299.99. Perfect for pet owners, the Dyson V8 features a de-tangling motor bar that works across hardwood floors and carpets and can transform into a handheld vac for quick and convenient clean-ups. Amazon has the top-rated iRobot Roomba robot vacuum on sale for $149.99 - the lowest price we've ever seen. Designed with homes with pets in mind, the Roomba features three levels of powerful suction for custom cleaning on carpets and hard floors and recharges itself when the battery is low. The top-rated Tineco cordless wet-dry vacuum mop combo is on sale for a record-low price of $99 at Walmart's sale ahead of Cyber Monday. The Tineco iFloor 2 vacuums and washes hard floors in one step, handling wet and dry messes in one sweep. Dyson cordless vacuums are always Cyber Monday best-sellers, and Walmart has the powerful V12 on sale for $399.99 - a record-low price. The V12 is Dyson's lightest cordless vacuum and features illumination technology that reveals invisible dust on hard floors so you don't leave anything behind. Here's a deal ahead of Cyber Monday on a Roomba robot vacuum mop combo, bringing the price down to its lowest ever. The j5 uses the iRobot Home App to create no-mop zones, so it will vacuum your hard floors while mopping at the same time but will avoid your carpet. Here's a huge $440 discount on a powerful and advanced robot vacuum from big-name brand iRobot. We praised its ability to pick up dirt from carpet and hard floors, and its self-charging feature in our iRobot Roomba J7 Plus review plus the convenient self-emptying bin. It is a bit noisy and sometimes struggles with larger debris but this is a good overall option. If you're looking for a budget laptop, Walmart's Cyber Monday sale has HP's 14-inch laptop for just $129 – an incredible price. For that money, you're getting an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB of SSD, and up to 10 hours of battery life. It's hard to find a better cheap laptop deal in the early Cyber Monday sales than this Inspiron 15. It's nothing fancy, but this machine manages to pack in both a powerful Ryzen 5 chipset and a sizeable 512GB SSD in for just $300 - that's not bad to say the least. While you're only getting 8GB of RAM here, this is still a good choice if you're just looking for a cost-effective machine to cover the basics. This is the best discount I've seen on the new Microsoft Surface Pro – and it's a tempting buy after we were super-impressed in our Surface Pro 11 review. This version boasts a gorgeous 13-inch PixelSense Flow OLED display at 2880 x 1920 resolution so it looks sharp and crisp with some vibrant colors and deep blacks. Meanwhile, the Snapdragon X Plus processor ensures excellent battery life and combines well with its many AI features to simplify your life. There’s also 16GB of memory and 512GB of SSD storage which will ensure speedy performance and enough storage space for your essential files and applications. Dell's Cyber Monday deals on the higher-end XPS 13 models are also amazing this week. Take this Ultra 7 configuration, for example, a massive $400 price cut makes this one a lot easier on the pocket. While I wouldn't immediately recommend a machine with 32GB of RAM to everyone (it's overkill for most), this is a great choice for a professional-grade laptop. The Sony WH-1000MX4 are older now but they are still some of the best over-ear headphones ever. These wireless Sony cans package together top-notch audio, excellent comfort, and effective noise cancellation all at a reasonable price point that's about $100 less than the newer Sony XM5 that are only a minor upgrade. We still rate these as the best headphones for most people, exactly because you can find them at a price like this during major sales such as Cyber Monday. The Bose QuietComfort headphones are the manufacturer's mid-range noise-cancelling cans and have dropped to a record-low price in this deal ahead of Cyber Monday. On top of the manufacturer's excellent ANC to block out unwanted noise, you get high-fidelity audio and an EQ control to customize bass, mid-range, and treble. The QuietComfort lasts up to 24 hours on one charge and can get back 2.5 hours of playtime in 15 minutes. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 are a refinement of the previous model with AirPods-like ear sticks, active noise cancellation, a 11mm driver, and AI-powered features like a voice-call booster and a translation tool – providing you have a modern Samsung phone. They look and feel good in your ears too with up to 5 hours of battery life with ANC on, making them good for your commute or workout. And now you can get them for as little as $39.99 with a trade-in, that's a bargain. Quite simply the best in Sony's class-leading wireless over-ear lineup. The older XM4 headphones were outstanding, the XM3 cans before it were excellent, and it'll come as little surprise to know that Sony's XM5 proposition is also incredibly hard to beat – especially with a whopping 25% off, equalling their lowest-ever price! They don't fold up like the XM4 but, as a quick glance at our Sony WH-100XM5 review proves, there's not much else to pick fault with. Looking to buy a smart speaker for a small space? Amazon's Cyber Monday deals include the all-new Echo Pop for just $17.99 - the cheapest Echo device you can buy right now. For that money, you're getting a compact smart speaker with Alexa built-in, so you can play music, ask questions, and check the weather completely hands-free. If you're looking for more robust sound, Amazon's Cyber Monday deals also include the Echo Dot for its lowest price. Amazon's best-selling smart speaker offers an improved audio experience, plus a new temperature sensor and all the handy features from Alexa, like playing music, answering questions, and checking the weather completely hands-free. Amazon's best-selling Echo Show 5 is on sale for a whopping 50% discount. The 2023 Echo Show 5 features a compact 5.5-inch display but packs impressive sound with deeper bass and clearer vocals. With Amazon Alexa, you can listen to podcasts, movies, music, and more. If you're after the best-value PS5 Slim console as well as the best-value bundle, then this Fortnite Cobalt Star listing at Walmart is the way to go. There have been savings galore for the Xbox Series X Digital Edition this Black Friday. And rightly so, as I feel its retail price is a touch on the pricey side given the lack of a disc drive. It's certainly more compelling below that $400 mark. Sadly there's no bundle here, but still a decent saving for the console itself. With fast performance for a smartwatch and a sleek design, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is instantly likeable. And now you can save up to $200 when you trade in your current device – alongside a flat $60 discount. Samsung's latest wearable provides more precise heart rate tracking than previous models, while it also helps you monitor how stressed you are and how well you’re sleeping. Think of it as your personal assistant on your wrist and you’re not far off. It even suggests how to respond to messages and notifications. Last year's best Fitbit Inspire 3 deal has returned to its lowest-ever price of $69.95, $30/30% off the usual list price of $99.95. Available in both colors, you'll get 24/7 heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and notifications from your communication apps. Get a massive $60 off the $160 Fitbit Charge 6 for a return to the lowest-ever price of $99.95. The ergonomic band and slender display provide sleep monitoring, multisport tracking, ECG, GPS, contactless payments, and more. ^ Back to all deals I'm TechRadar's lead for US deals and TV discounts, and I've been doing this for the last six years. I have a lot more experience than that, though – I've worked in ecommerce for 11 years. No one has combed through more deals than me, I promise you. Welcome to this afternoon's live coverage of all the best Cyber Monday deals still available. While there are just hours left until most offers expire, there are plenty of deals to shop from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart.I'll highlight all the top offers on tech gadgets, appliances, and beauty items from brands like Apple, Samsung, Bissell, Dyson, Sony, and Keurig. The TechRadar team has also reviewed most of the products listed in the guide so we can help you find the right product at the lowest price possible. Remember that Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart's Cyber Monday sales end tonight, and this might be your last chance to score your dream purchase at a record-low price. If you're looking for the cheapest Cyber Monday OLED TV deal, Best Buy has LG's excellent 48-inch B4 OLED TV on sale for $599.99 - an incredible price for an OLED display.LG's B4 self-lit OLED pixels and Dolby Vision together enhance color and contrast beyond what the average backlit TV can do. Its built-in gaming features and 120Hz refresh rate make it an unbeatable deal for gamers looking for an upgrade.LG 48-inch B4 OLED TV: was $1,499.99 now $599.99 at Best Buy I already own the third-generation Echo Dot and can't imagine life without it. The smart speaker plays music, answers any question I throw at it, and tells me the weather forecast - all I have to do is ask Alexa. The compact Echo Pop is Amazon's latest smart speaker. It shares all the same features I love about the Echo Dot but in a more compact design. The best part? Amazon's Cyber Monday sale has included a free Amazon Basics Smart Color Bulb for just $17.99 - a massive 66% discount. Echo Pop + Amazon Basics Smart Color Bulb: was $39.99 now $17.99 at Amazon This would make a GREAT stocking stuffer idea – the wildly popular Apple AirTag 4-pack is on sale for its lowest price yet.The Apple AirTag is a handy Bluetooth location-tracking device that pairs with your iPhone.

It's this offer on Hulu that's already proved tremendously popular over the last few days. And, honestly, I can see why. You can pay just $0.99 per month for a Hulu subscription with ads, which saves you almost $100 over a year's membership. There's also an option to bundle it with Disney Plus for a measly $2.99 a month – another huge bargain for both streaming services. This one ends today, though, so it's definitely one I'd pull the trigger on as soon as possible. ENDS TONIGHT – Get Hulu for $0.99 per month There were a lot of disappointed faces in the TechRadar office when we saw the Kindle deals over Amazon Prime Day and the Prime Big Deal Days sale. A lot of us – and I'm sure many of you too – pinned a lot of hopes on big discounts during those Amazon-exclusive sales. And there wasn't much to be excited about at all. At least there's been some improvement in the Cyber Monday sales, with both the latest Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite getting their first-ever price cuts. Sure, both ereaders are nowhere near as cheap as I've seen previous versions in the past, but these are still decent offers for the new and improved models with bigger screens and longer battery life. I'm confident in saying these will likely be the best offers we see until at least July next year, so don't miss your chance to get a discount before the Amazon Cyber Monday sale ends later tonight.

The thinnest Apple Watch ever and the one with the biggest display is down to a record-low price this Cyber Monday. The 42mm Apple Watch Series 10 is just $329 (originally $399), and the larger 46mm is only $359 (originally $429). Both of these come in several shades, including a polished Jet Black finish, and feature an Always-On display that gets plenty bright. Out of the box, you'll find the latest version of watchOS 11 with the new smart stack. If you've been waiting to score the best Apple Watch for most folks, now's the time. Apple Watch Series 10 42mm (GPS): was $399 now $329 at Amazon Apple Watch Series 10 46mm (GPS): was $429 now $359 at Amazon This might be the best Cyber Monday TV deal I've spotted. The LG C4 is a successor to last year's LG C3 OLED, which TechRadar highly praised and is ranked in our best TV guide. Upgrades to the LG C4 include an improved picture experience with boosted brightness, a 144hz refresh rate, and LG's latest Alpha 9 AI chip.Today's deal from Amazon brings the price of this 42-inch model down to $896.99 - that's a new record-low price and an incredible deal for an OLED display.LG's 42-inch C4 OLED TV: was $1,499.99 now $896.99 at Amazon The Bissell Little Green portable carpet cleaner is an appliance I already own and can't live without, thanks to my two little messy boys.

The Blink Mini 2 features night vision and two-way audio so you can hear and speak to visitors, and it will alert your smartphone when motion is detected. Blink Mini 2: was $39.99 now $19.99 at Amazon I always include Crest's 3D Whitestrips in my favorite Cyber Monday deals, and it's one of my yearly purchases. They're expensive and rarely on sale, so Cyber Monday is the perfect opportunity to find them on sale.

This way, you can play your Sony favorites and get the mighty DualSense Controller included in the box.PS5 Slim Digital Edition: was $499.99 now $424 at Walmart It's hard not to recommend Sony's excellent WH-1000XM5, which are some of the best over-ear headphones you can buy. The previous model was already outstanding, but the XM5 are even better. We generally recommend the XM4 instead, because the difference is not that great given the higher price, but today's Cyber Monday deal at Amazon makes it a harder decision, with a whopping 25% off the newer model. If you do want to go for the XM4 instead, they're a full $100 cheaper, also at Amazon. Tough choices await!Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones: was $399.99 now $298 at Amazon Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones: was $399.99 now $198 at Amazon This is the best price you'll find on an Apple MacBook, and I'm shocked it's still in stock.

The third-generation Oura Ring can track your sleep, activity, stress, and heart rate and is available in several different sizes and colors.Oura Ring Generation 3 Horizon: was $349 now $299 at Amazon If you're looking for a cheap and compact coffee maker, this Keurig deal is a must-see. Keurig's K-Express is just seven inches wide and compact, making it a great option for those working with a smaller kitchen space. The coffee maker can brew a cup in just minutes with different size options, from 6 to 12 ounces, using Keurig K-Cup pods.Keurig K-Express coffee maker: was $89.99 now $59.99 at Amazon It's now past Midnight ET, so Walmart's official Cyber Monday sale is over. The good news is that Best Buy and Amazon still have Cyber Monday deals available, and I'm still highlighting tonight's best offers. When it comes to cheap laptops, the official Dell Store is always a good shout over Cyber Monday. 2024 is no different in this regard considering you can pick up this heavily discounted Dell Inspiron 15 today.

The good news is that I'm already seeing several offers stick around even after sales have ended at some retailers, so you should be able to secure a few last-minute bargains if you've missed anything over the last few weeks. I'll continue sharing any of these hidden gems right here. And that's a wrap for Cyber Monday 2024.

There'll be lots of wrap-up to do as a few sales should keep rolling this week and through to Christmas, so I'll be here continuing to search for all the best deals and highlighting them for you.

Title: I'd leave the Xbox controller on its shelf this Cyber Monday and buy this $35 gamepad instead

Do you really need a wireless controller? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The GameSir G7 SE is meant to be a budget controller that you can get for cheap, but I don't think it's supposed to be better than the official gamepad that comes in your Xbox's box. GameSir clearly didn't understand that assignment though, because although it has a cutesie look and an unassuming face, it's a fully-fledged pro controller for Xbox and PC that I'd easily recommend over Microsoft's version. It's also blissfully cheap thanks to Cyber Monday sales at the moment. Reduced from its $45 regular price, it's down to $35.99 at Amazon. That saving applies to all of its colorways, including the white, eggshell model I tested for review, as well as the Blue, Orange, and Purple versions that have been released since. Rather annoyingly, this Cyber Monday Xbox deal is a Prime exclusive, but luckily there's an offer on the retail page to take out a 30-day free trial if you aren't already a member. I've spotted the G7 SE drop down to this price a few times now, and it's always one I'd recommend to people looking for a spare controller to throw into their rotation because there's amazing value to be had from it. GameSir G7 SE | $44.99 $35.99 at AmazonSave $10 - A $10 reduction on an already very affordable controller is never a bad thing, and for your money here, you get two back buttons, audio controls, deadzone customization, and great ergonomics. Buy it if: ✅ You want a controller with back buttons✅ You don't mind a wired connection✅ You like a smaller-feeling controller Don't buy it if: ❌ You prefer larger, heavier controllers❌ You want color options GameSir doesn't provide UK: £39 at Amazon Whether you're a PC gamer looking for a controller to occasionally use in games that require one, or you're an Xbox player needing something up a level from the stock Wireless controller, the GameSir G7 SE is a great option. It's one of the more affordable Xbox pro controllers out there today, but it's still one of the first I'll look for when it comes to the likes of Black Friday and Prime Day because its features give even the expensive ones a run for their money. Two back buttons can make a huge difference after you spend a bit of time getting used to them. They mean you don't have to rely on quick thumb movements for all of your in-game functions, and in first-person games you don't need to take your thumbs off the sticks as much, resulting in better aim and movement. The back buttons here are placed beautifully so you don't need to adjust your natural grip to press them - they fall right under your middle fingers. GameSir was also one of the first brands to really embrace the anti-stick drift movement by adopting Hall Sensor thumbsticks in all of its products. If you've been burned by one too many cheap gamepads that have broken down over time, this is a brand I think you really need to know about. I've tested its best PC controllers over hundreds of hours at this point, and they're some of the most reliable I've ever used. The Windows app you can use to customize their deadzones, button mapping, and more is really impressive too. Of course, the one drawback to this controller is that it came out before Xbox relaxed its licensing parameters, and as a result, it can only work with your PC or Xbox with a wired connection. There is a 3m cable in the box here, but if that's going to be a dealbreaker, maybe check out one of the other best Xbox Series X controllers. There are more deals where that came from. Check out some Cyber Monday gaming PC deals, Cyber Monday Meta Quest deals, and Cyber Monday gaming chair deals. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more One of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Jump straight to the deals you want...1. Quick links2. PCG's top products3. Today's top deals4. Deal hubs5. Live updates That's it, Black Friday is well and truly done. But just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in to give you peak Cyber Monday gaming deals realness. Sure, we've got a guide going over the full range of the best Cyber Monday PC gaming deals, but I'm here to give you that personal touch, and highlight the deals as they pop up and give you the cream of the crop. Crops have cream, right? Like, oats have milk. I digress. As Cyber Monday begins properly today, and Cyber Week goes on beyond that, we've already seen a bunch of last week's deals either go out of stock or rise to the point where we no longer recommend them. BUT that's not to say that they won't be back. What we often see is that specific Black Friday deals that might have gone 'off sale' over the weekend get picked up again on Cyber Monday and sold as fresh deals. But, y'know, with the same price. There will also be some genuinely fresh deals cropping up over the next few days as Cyber Week cracks on. Already I've found a couple of good gaming laptops and gaming PCs that weren't around just a few days ago. There are also some actually great handheld gaming PC deals, too. So, if you've been itching to get on the mobile gaming bandwagon there literally has never been a better time. So, if you're in the mood to either treat yourself, or make sure you get your Christmas shopping done early, and with a smattering of solid discounts to make your money go further, stay with me as I'm going to keep on hunting out the best tech deals this Cyber Week and posting them here. We'll also be regularly updating our Cyber Monday deal hubs throughout this time, but this is where I want to highlight here my absolute favorite PC gaming deals. But why me? Well, I've been doing this a long time. Way before Black Friday or Cyber Monday were fashionable—I mean, look, all the cool kids are doing it now—I was casting around to find you lovely people the best deals, and I've also been a technology journalist for over 19 years now so I've got a pretty good idea of what's good, what's not, and what's just some retailer or manufacturer trying to make a fast buck out of old stock. As well as the best deals, we're also tracking down the best prices on the key products from our full suite of product buying guides. We maintain those guides throughout the year, completely based on products we have reviewed ourselves and can absolutely stand by their continued excellence. Dave's been doing the PC hardware dance since back in 2005, and building gaming PCs since the '90s. You know, when it was difficult. In his time he's tested every type of PC component, peripheral, and accessory you can imagine, and probably some you can't. That makes him perfectly placed to recommend the best deals, and the ones you need to steer clear of this Black Friday. Nvidia GeForce-powered gaming PCs AMD Radeon-powered gaming PCs Gaming laptop deals Graphics card deals Gaming monitor deals 1. Yeyian Tanto | Intel Core i5 13400F | RTX 4070 Super | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $1,599.99 $1,199.99 at Newegg (save $400)Yeyian has a stellar deal on an RTX 4070 Super machine here. We've seen slightly cheaper versions on sale, but this one at least does have proper DDR5 memory, making the motherboard at least nominally upgradeable to a more modern spec. It does make a bit of an odd combo with the Core i5 here, though for straightforward gaming performance, it shouldn't prove any issue and deliver high frame rates. 2. Corsair TC100 | Fabric and leatherette | $249.99 $179.99 at Best Buy (save $70)The TC100 is our favorite affordable gaming chair right now, following up on the popular T3 Rush with a great look and genuine comfort. You can read more in our review. Right now, even with only a light discount, it's a truly excellent gaming chair that's cheaper than most of its competition. Price check: Corsair $179.99 | B&H Photo $179.99 (sold out) | Amazon $179.99 (sold out) 3. Yeyian Tanto | Core i5 13400F | RTX 4060 | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $1,099 $749.99 at Newegg (save $349.01)This isn't the cheapest RTX 4060 gaming PC we've found this sales season, but this is the one that I'd be buying right now. While the other budget systems are similarly sporting last-gen CPUs, the Core i5 13400F is identical to the 14th Gen alternative, and faster than the Arrow Lake chips for gaming. Paired up with an RTX 4060 and 16 GB of relatively quick DDR5 memory makes this a great budget system. 4. MSI MAG 321UPX | 32-inch | 4K | 240 Hz | QD-OLED | $799.99 at Amazon (save $100)With its special launch price of $949, the MSI MAG 321UPX was already by far the cheapest of the new generation of gorgeous high-pixel density 4K gaming OLEDs. But you can already get for $50 off. It makes most 27-inch 1440p OLEDs look painfully overpriced. It may be out of stock when you click through, but it's worth checking back for this great deal. Price check: Newegg $799.99 (sold out) 5. MSI RTX 4070 Ti Super | 16 GB GDDR6X | 8,448 shaders | 2,655 MHz boost | $839.99 $739.99 at Amazon (save $100)The RTX 4070 Ti Super might be relatively new to the market, but we're still seeing some discounts on what is a very performant card. This model is very solid and comes with a triple fan cooler, and with the power of DLSS 3 makes for a mighty addition to any gaming rig. RTX 4070 Ti Super price check: Newegg $739.99 | Walmart $759.99 | Best Buy $799.99 6. MSI Vector 16 HX | RTX 4080 | Core i9 14900HX | 16-inch | 1600p | 240 Hz | 1 TB SSD | 32 GB RAM | $2,099 $1,849 at B&H (save $250)Of the two MSI Vector machines we've highlighted here, I'd rather this one. It has a newer, more powerful CPU, a better screen resolution and refresh rate for an RTX 4080, and 32 GB of RAM. Altogether, that makes for a pretty sweet package and an upgrade worth the extra $100 over the cheapest RTX 4080 laptop we've found so far. Price check: Microcenter $1,999.99 7. ASRock Phantom Gaming | 27-inch | 1080p | 165 Hz | IPS | $179.99 $99.77 at Newegg (save $79.22)ASRock has become a favorite of ours around here over busy shopping periods. These screens always seem to be on offer, and from the one we've used (read our review) they're good value for the money, too. You can't really complain with this 165Hz panel for just under $100. 8. HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless | 50 mm drivers | 15-21,000 Hz | Closed-back | Wireless | $199.99 $125.99 at Amazon (save $74)The HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless is one of our all-time favorite gaming headsets for many reasons, but there's a big headline feature to talk about here: 300-hour battery life. No, we didn't make a typo. 300 hours of gaming goodness on a single charge, excellent DTS:X Spatial Audio, and premium comfort features make this headset an absolute stunner of a buy at this price. In fact, when we reviewed it the only major negative we could find was a slightly uninspiring microphone. Absolutely worth a serious look this one, at any level of discount. Price check: Walmart $149.99 | Newegg $144.99 9. ASRock Challenger RX 7800 XT | 16 GB GDDR6 | 3,840 shaders | 2,475 MHz boost | $469.99 $449.99 at Newegg (save $20)At this price point, the best card used to be the RX 6800 XT but these days we have deals like this one, where the 7800 XT has the same price tag. It's only a little bit faster than the card it's replaced, but you're still getting a lotta GPU for the money. RX 7800 XT price check: | Best Buy $469.99 | Amazon $449.99 10. LG UltraGear 34GP63A-B | 34-inch | 3440 x 1440 | 165 Hz | VA | Curved | $399.99 $239.99 at Amazon (save $160)At its current price, this LG ultrawide is a genuine bargain. By comparison, Alienware's fancy QD-OLED 34-inch panel is around $800 even on sale. This LG matches its size, resolution, aspect ratio and refresh rate for less than one-third of the price, although of course, it is a VA panel, not an OLED. It's also not the brightest gaming monitor ever, but it is a very good deal. Price check: LG $239.99 The number of sub-$200 gaming monitors, that are both high refresh rate and with a 1440p native resolution is nuts. That used to be the preserve of much more expensive screens, but thanks to the Cyber Monday gaming monitor deals going down right now, you're getting big brand monitors on sale for often actually less than $150. Now, that's not exactly throw away money, but it's now a price where you could probably suck it up for the extra sharpness and Windows screen real estate you get with a 2560 x 1440 screen. And these are either IPS or VA panels, too, like actually good displays. These are five of the best still around: Acer KA272U | 27-inch | 1440p | 100 Hz | IPS | $199.99 $139.99 at Best Buy (save $60)If you're on the tightest of budgets, this will get you a decently sized 1440p monitor for a real bargain price. It's even got a higher-than-60 Hz refresh rate. Okay, 100 Hz isn't spectacular, but it is still notably smoother than 60 Hz. It's also not the brightest screen, rated at 250 nits peak, but the compromises will have to come in somewhere. If you want something brighter, the $145 ASRock below is a true winner. ASRock Phantom PG27Q15R2A | 27-inch | 1440p | 165 Hz | VA | $239.99 $142.77 at Newegg (save $97.22)ASRock's gaming monitors are always so darned cheap—we love them for that. This 1440p panel offers resolution and a rapid refresh rate for a potent PC gaming combo, though the built-in Wi-Fi antenna helps it stand out from the crowd. That's hardly essential, but could come in use for some. Acer Nitro ED270U | 27-inch | 1440p | 170 Hz | VA | $249.99 $149.99 at Newegg (save $100)This is one of the best deals on a 1440p gaming monitor we've seen so far. A respectable brand and a respectable spec, although it might be worth holding out for an IPS panel. Still, a good price on a great little screen. Price check: Amazon $184.10 Acer Nitro XV271U M3bmiiprx | 27-inch | 1440p | 180 Hz | IPS | $289.99 $169.99 at Amazon (save $120)This Acer monitor is a steal for all you prospective competitive gamers, hitting a high refresh rate and low response time sweet spot (0.5-1 ms gray-to-gray). It's the same price as the Odyssey G5 below but is better for those of you who prefer an IPS panel to a VA. Price check: Newegg $251 Samsung Odyssey G5 G55C | 27-inch | 1440p | 165 Hz | VA | Curved | $299.00 $195.99 at Newegg (save $104)This monitor was already a great deal at its previous price. Now, for well under $200 it's a steal. Samsung has form when it comes to getting VA panels to achieve good response. Put simply, Samsung VA panels are the quickest. I'm going to say that, for my Cyber Monday bingo, I did not have two actually pretty damned good RTX 4070 gaming laptops on sale for less than $880. Okay, they're only a solid cent under that price, but still, that is an unprecedented pricetag for any gaming laptop sporting this GPU. The only issue with either machine is that they are sporting a single 512 GB SSD which is guaranteed to get filled with games as fast as you can download them. At the moment 1 TB is kinda the minimum we'd want as our boot drives, but both of these impressive budget machines come with spare M.2 slots in the back of them, making an SSD upgrade as easy as it could possibly be. If it's my money, I think I'd be more tempted by the HP machine with its more up-to-date AMD Ryzen CPU. That's a proper Zen 4 chip in there, rather than the slightly odd Zen 3.5+ offering in the Lenovo. But still, I really like the Lenovo chassis and keyboard, so it's still a bit of a toss-up. Both are going to perform well in games, that's for sure. HP Victus 16 | Ryzen 7 8845HS | RTX 4070 | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 512 GB SSD | $1,399.99 $879.99 at Best Buy (save $520)This is easily the cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop on the list right now, and the cheapest I think I've ever seen one on sale for. The RTX 4070 isn't a super low spec either, and seems to be a 115 W version. The only real concern I have is that the 512 GB SSD will get filled up fast, but there is a second SSD slot easily accessible in the back of the laptop, so is an easy upgrade. The screen isn't super bright, either, but at 300 nits it will be fine unless you're in a bright office or direct sunlight. Lenovo LOQ 15ARP9 | RTX 4070 | Ryzen 7 7435HS | 15.6-inch | 144 Hz | 16 GB RAM | 512 GB SSD | $1,199.99 $879.99 at Walmart (save $320)This is the cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop I've seen so far this Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. Not only that, but it doesn't entirely suck in other ways. There's a reasonable amount of dual-channel memory and a speedy IPS screen. The 512 GB SSD does, however, suck, but you can easily upgrade it with the spare NVMe slot inside. Do you know what I'm obsessed with when it comes to gaming laptops? Inches. Namely 14 of the old imperial measurements. That's right, I frickin' love a 14-inch gaming laptop. Now, I am a man of a certain age, with fading eyes, but even then I think that size of laptop and laptop screen are the perfect scale for a genuine mobile gaming machine. The new 16-inch machines maybe aren't that much bigger, but for me they're still just getting on for that too big for travelling thing. A 14-incher, however, is much more easily used on plane's tray table, much better for balancing on your knees when you're sat on the floor in a crowded departure lounge, or even just to sit on a wee cafe table. And you can get serious performance in that slight form factor now, and there are some decent Cyber Monday 14-inch gaming laptop deals. The first thing to note is that there is absolutely a price premium for this smaller laptop form factor, so if that is absolutely your primary concern there are far cheaper RTX 4060-powered gaming laptops around. Because, yes, these machines are rather pricey in the context of RTX 4060 laptops, in fact you can find several RTX 4070 notebooks for less. But if you're after the form factor, these are the best 14-inch deals going. Omen Transcend 14 | RTX 4060 | Core Ultra 7 155H | 14-inch | 2880 x 1800 | OLED | 512 GB SSD | 16 GB RAM | $1,729.99 $1,129.99 at HP (save $600)This is a very specific type of laptop for a very specific type of person, but if you are that person, there's a good saving to be had. It's a teeny tiny little device with an RTX 4060 and one of Intel's Meteor Lake chips inside it. It has a more sleek chassis than most on this list, though that does come with a higher fee. It's basically RTX 4070 money for an RTX 4060. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 | RTX 4060 | Ryzen 9 8945HS | 16 GB LPDDR5X | 1 TB SSD | 1800p | OLED | 120 Hz | $1,599.99 $1,199.99 at Best Buy (save $400)You're really paying for the form factor here, as you might have noticed this laptop is surrounded by similarly price machines with RTX 4070s in them. Though the G14 is a wonderfully compact machine with a gorgeous OLED and all-metal chassis. It's a premium pick—there's a reason they're competing with Razer's Blade laptops—and the premium price can only be avoided so much. Still, $400 off isn't bad. Asus TUF A14 | RTX 4060 | Ryzen AI HX 370 | 14-inch | 16 GB RAM | 1 TB SSD | $1,499 $1,349 at Walmart (save $150)The TUF A14 was a bit of a surprise package to arrive in the PCG office this year, and I ended up a big fan in my review of it. It's a big upgrade on the previous generation of 14-inch, taking many of the design notes from the premium Zephyrus range, but doing so in a more affordable form. It's still a little pricey for an RTX 4060 laptop if that's all you're after, but for a compact 14-inch version with AMD's latest, even a small discount is decent. Keep it clean, people. You're desktop, I mean. I am, however, a man living in a glass house lobbing rocks about because if you were to glimpse my office space in PC Gamer Towers it would shock and disappoint you. It's gross. And I could probably do with at three of the five different PC cleaning goodies that our Jess has tracked down this Cyber Monday. SNACTIV PRO Finger Chopsticks | 4.21 inches | Glow in the dark | Dishwasher safe | $19.99 $15.79 at Amazon (save $4.20)If regular chopsticks require just a wee bit too much coordination for you—no judgment here—this tweezer tool that slips between your knuckles may be the perfect alternative utensil for eating your crumbly snack of choice. Tassmpitor Laptop and Keyboard Cleaning Kit | Cleaning brushes | Lens cleaner pen | Keycap puller | Refillable screen cleaning spray | $15.99 $12.27 at Amazon (save $3.72)Compact and portable, this cleaning kit has everything you need to keep your keyboard from getting crusty. With multiple, dainty little tools, there's nowhere to hide for dust, dirt, or crumbs. Compressed Air Duster & Mini Vacuum Keyboard Cleaner | Cordless | Range of detachable nozzles | $27.99 $21.99 at Newegg (same $6)This portable, handheld vacuum cleaner can do so much more than keep your keyboard free of crumbs. When sucking up dirt just won't suffice, the air vent on the back of the device lets you switch up your cleaning tactics. Colorcoral Universal Dust Cleaner Gel | Yellow | Lemon scent fragrance | No rinse necessary | Reusable | $11.99 $5.91 at Amazon (save $6.08)When a brush or vacuum just won't do, you'll need something that can take hold of the situation with an adhesive grip. Make no mistake, this will root out the toughest of dust bunnies from your hardware. VCOM RGB Gaming Headphones Stand | Black | 2 USB Type-A ports, 1 USB Type-C port | RGB lighting | 10 light modes | $21.99 $18.04 at Amazon (save $3.95)Tidy up your desk setup with this all-in-one stand. Stack your gaming headset, gamepads or other controllers, and more all on this snazzy rack with RGB lighting. There are still a ton of great Cyber Monday gaming PC deals alive out there. And our Andy has been running the rule over what's left and in his wisdom he's calling out these as the five best gaming PC deals still going strong today. CyberPowerPC Gamer Master | Ryzen 5 5500 | RTX 4060 | 16 GB DDR4 | 1 TB SSD | $879.99 $749.99 at Best Buy (save $130)This may be sporting a budget processor from a couple of AMD generations ago, but in combination with that RTX 4060 it should still be a mean lean machine for 1080p gaming—with even the odd dollop of 1440p thanks to DLSS 3. You're also getting a full 1 TB SSD and 16 GB of, admittedly DDR4, memory into the bargain. The AM4 platform may be old now, but it still has upgrade legs, and you could eventually stick a Ryzen 7 5700X3D in there to really beef up the gaming performance for not a lot of cash. Yeyian Tanto | Ryzen 5 7500F | RTX 4060 Ti | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $1,299 $949.99 at Newegg (save $350)This is the cheapest RTX 4060 Ti build around at the moment, and is actually a pretty decent rig. There are other options with low-end Core i5 chips, but this Zen 4 F-series CPU comes with six cores and 12 threads, and sits in an AM5 motherboard which gives it an upgrade path. The board is pretty low-spec however, so will likely only have space for the one SSD, but what you get is a full 1 TB. And that 16 GB of DDR5-5600 is pretty quick, too. Yeyian Tanto | Core i5 14400F | RTX 4070 | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 1 TB SSD | $1,599 $1,149.99 at Newegg (save $350)RTX 4070 machines can vary in price and specification quite significantly, but here you're getting that great 1440p GPU (with even some 4K credentials thanks to DLSS 3), a nice and speedy Core i5 paired with a proper 32 GB dose of DDR5 RAM, and a 1 TB SSD. That's a really great selection of hardware that makes it a great gaming rig for more like budget prices. iBuyPower RDY Slate | Core i7 14700KF | RTX 4070 Super | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $1,999 $1,399 at iBuyPower (save $600 with checkout code CYBERMONDAY)Yes, you can find slightly cheaper RTX 4070 Super builds right now, but not one that's as well-rounded as this particular beastie. With this machine, you're getting an up-to-date platform with a particularly fast CPU (ensure it has the latest BIOS, though), 32 GB of fast RAM, and 2 TB of storage. Noice. Yeyian Gaming PC | Core i7 13700F | RTX 4080 | 32 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $2,299.99 $1,999.99 at Newegg (save $300)While this is the old RTX 4080 and not the Super variant, it's got virtually identical performance, so this machine's still a mighty powerful rig for less than $2,000. The Core i7 CPU is a fine pairing for the GPU, and is backed up by 32 GB of relatively speedy DDR5 memory. The 1 TB SSD is the bare minimum amount of storage you'd expect to see at this price, but this is still an excellent gaming PC for the money. Look at it. JUST LOOK AT IT! Now, that's a controller. Seriously, this 8BitDo pad is outstanding. Not even just for the fact that it's only $25 right now in the Cyber Monday sales, but because of what you get in it. We're talking Hall effect sticks, so no more drift, AND Hall effect triggers, too. Normally we find it hard to look past the stock controllers from Microsoft and Sony for a pad recommendation; they're just so well built and genuinely affordable. But the 8BitDo Ultimate 2C has everything they do, and more. Our Jacob has been testing it recently for a review and has become rather enamoured with the controller. 8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless | Mint | $29.99 $25.49 (save $4.50 at Amazon)We've already raved about Hall Effect joysticks and how they spell the end for the dreaded stick drift. In this wireless gaming controller, they're a welcome feature, as are the extra bumper buttons. Oh, and that's a seriously cheap price tag for a quality product, of course. Which is the main reason to pick one up: it feels very premium for the price. Just a good old fashioned great PC for a great price. There are cheaper RTX 4070 Super machines, but this one comes with a spec so well rounded that you will not be able to find a tangible flaw in this build. Normally we will complain about a miserly 1 TB of SSD storage space in a $1,400 gaming PC, but not here, because iBuyPower has jammed a full 2 TB drive in there. We won't complain about the memory so much, but we do expect at least 16 GB of RAM in our modern gaming PCs. Here iBuyPower has gone over and above again, with 32 GB of the good stuff in there. And I mean good stuff, too, because it's quick 6000 MT/s DDR5, which is just about the sweet spot for that Intel Core i7 CPU. It's a quality spec, for a quality machine. iBuyPower RDY Slate 8MP 002 | Core i7 14700KF | Nvidia RTX 4070 Super | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $1,999 $1,399 at iBuyPower (save $600 with code CYBERMONDAY at checkout)Yes, you can find a cheaper RTX 4070 build right now, but not one that's as well-rounded as this one. With this, you're getting an up-to-date platform with a fast CPU (ensure it has the latest BIOS, though), 32 GB of speedy RAM, and 2 TB of storage. Noice. The Lemokey G1 is an excellent, affordable wireless gaming mouse, now made even more affordable thanks to the Cyber Monday deals. It's accurate, lightweight, and feels good in the hand. In fact, I think I might prefer it to the DeathAdder V3 Pro which I use every day, and which now feels rather chunky in my soft gamer hands. With the Lemokey G1 at just $52 at Amazon you're getting a serious wireless gaming mouse for the money. With key specs, such as the 30K DPI, and 750 IPS tracking, it's a great mouse for gaming. Though I would ask you to ignore the 8K polling rate stuff; that's of dubious benefit at the best of times, and here it doesn't really work brilliantly and will just drain the battery more than is really necessary. Lemokey G1 | Wireless | 30,000 DPI | 55 g | $74.99 $52.49 at Amazon (save $22.50)Lemokey is better known for its gaming keyboards I'll wager, as the gaming subsidiary of Keychron, but it also makes great, affordable gaming mice, too. I recently reviewed the G1, and came away very impressed, even over the DeathAdder V3 Pro I use daily. The Lemokey is lighter and just feels more rapid. It's also a lot more affordable, espeically at this price. Just don't get too carried away with its promises of 8K polling—that just drains battery and performs a bit weirdly. Price check: Lemokey: $62.10 No rebate, no Prime members only shenanigans, just the cheapest price we've seen the Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti Super retailing for ever. Now, granted it's not a spectacular discount in real terms—while the MSI MSRP is down as $839.99, the standard MSRP was $799.99—this is still the most affordable the card has been. In the run up to the new GeForce generation dropping in January you might question spending even the $740 the MSI RTX 4070 Ti Super is going for on Amazon. That is a valid concern, and if you're happy with your current setup and reckon you'd fine waiting until at least the middle of 2025 to upgrade, then by all means wait and see what launches in that price bracket, and wait for it to come back into stock after the first flush of RTX 50-series GPUs get swallowed up. But if you're after a new graphics card today, and one that is pretty damned powerful but not too punitively priced, then the RTX 4070 Ti Super—dumb name and all—is a worthy purchase. MSI RTX 4070 Ti Super | 16 GB GDDR6X | 8,448 shaders | 2,655 MHz boost | $839.99 $739.99 at Amazon (save $100)The RTX 4070 Ti Super might be relatively new to the market, but we're still seeing some discounts on what is a very performant card. This model is very solid and comes with a triple fan cooler, and with the power of DLSS 3 makes for a mighty addition to any gaming rig. RTX 4070 Ti Super price check: Newegg $739.99 | Walmart $759.99 | Best Buy $799.99 Boo, the most affordable 4K OLED gaming monitor, that MSI one that was on sale for $700 over the past week, has lost its discount. Now that one is back up to $867 at Amazon. Nightmare. Well, not too much of a nightmare because the 240 Hz version of that MSI OLED, the MSI MAG 321UPX is still on sale for less, for $800 at Amazon. It sucks that it's $100 more than the Black Friday deal, but is still a great price for a 32-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor that was once around the $1,000 mark. In fact, most of the other 4K OLEDs using the same 32-inch panel are still retailing for over $1,000, so this still represents a good Cyber Monday gaming monitor deal. MSI MAG 321UPX | 32-inch | 4K | 240 Hz | QD-OLED | $799.99 at Amazon (save $100)With its special launch price of $949, the MSI MAG 321UPX was already by far the cheapest of the new generation of gorgeous high-pixel density 4K gaming OLEDs. But you can already get for $50 off. It makes most 27-inch 1440p OLEDs look painfully overpriced. It may be out of stock when you click through, but it's worth checking back for this great deal. Price check: Newegg $799.99 (sold out) Wireless gaming mice are grand, but largely a nice-to-have luxury. Wireless gaming keyboards are... well, IMO kinda pointless at best and a pain in the butt at worst. But wireless gaming headsets, that's a PC peripheral that I would say was made for low latency wireless protocols. Though it must be said a good wireless mouse is more affordable today than ever before. But I digress. The thing is, whether you think the cable on a mouse is unsightly, unless it's frustratingly stiff and gets in the way while you're playing it will have no material effect on the performance of the mouse. The same goes with keyboards, though it's actually even less useful as you keyboard, ideally, shouldn't be moving around as you type, negating any freedom-of-movement benefit from being wireless. But a wired gaming headset tethering your head to your PC is an abomination. Not only are you guaranteed at some point to stand up from desk while wearing your headset and either yank the cable out, bend the plug, or tip over your PC, but you will also hear that cable. You know that sound when the cable's rubbing against your clothes as you move your head around, and it translates into the ear cups strapped to your head? Yeah, you don't get any of that with a wireless headset. So, I'm firmly in the pro wireless headset corner, and this Cyber Monday there are deals on the good, better, best cable-free cans that we recommend as the best wireless gaming headsets. Corsair HS55 Wireless Core | 50 mm drivers | 20 Hz - 20,000 Hz | Closed-back | 2.4 GHz + Bluetooth | $99.99 $54.99 at Newegg (save $45)This is the Core version of our best budget wireless gaming headset, and it's on sale for a price that actually undercuts the wired version right now. The only difference with this Core version and the standard headset is that this one doesn't have iCUE support... which I don't think anyone outside of Corsair is going to miss. Price check: Amazon $54.99 HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless | 50 mm drivers | 15-21,000 Hz | Closed-back | Wireless | $199.99 $124.13 at Amazon (save $75.86)The HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless is one of our all-time favorite gaming headsets for many reasons, but there's a big headline feature to talk about here: 300-hour battery life. No, we didn't make a typo. 300 hours of gaming on a single charge, excellent DTS:X Spatial Audio, and premium comfort features make this headset an absolute stunner of a buy at this price. In fact, when we reviewed it the only major negative we could find was a slightly uninspiring microphone. Absolutely worth a serious look this one, at any level of discount. Price check: Walmart $125.99 | Newegg $144.99 Audeze Maxwell | 90mm planar magnetic drivers | 10 Hz to 50,000 Hz | Wireless | $299.99 $267.73 at Amazon (save $32.28)Well, here it is. The ultimate in wireless audiophile gaming headsets, the Audeze Maxwell makes use of a set of planar magnetic drivers to deliver audio quality that makes reviewers gush the world over. It's a bit heavy, and the software isn't great, but otherwise, this is a symphony of gaming headset luxury—as we found in our 93% review. Price check: Best Buy $299.99 From a pure price per gigabyte metric, these are the best-value SSDs around right now. Now, that doesn't mean they are the absolute best in their capacity class—there are faster drives for not a lot more cash in our regularly updated best Cyber Monday SSD deals page, such as the 1 TB Nextorage NEM-PAB which is up there with the fastest PCIe 4.0 drives, for just $68 at Newegg ($0.068 / GB). But on a pure costing basis, for the amount of storage space you get in return these three drives are the absolute lost price/GB SSDs on sale right now. Team Group MP44L | 1 TB | M.2 2280 | PCIe 4.0 | 5,000 MB/s read | 4,500 MB/s write | $79.99 $54.99 at Amazon (save $25)The MP44L is far from being the fastest SSD you can buy but for the money, you really can't complain. The read/write speeds are pretty low compared to others in our curated list, but they're still fast enough for most users and way better than a SATA SSD. If you avoid using it for heavy data transfers, you'll have no problems with it. Price check: Newegg $54.99 (out of stock) Silicon Power UD90 | 2 TB | NVMe | PCIe 4.0 | 5,000 MB/s read | 4,800 MB/s write | $97.97 $92.97 at Amazon (save $5)You might not know Silicon Power from Samsung, but this SSD is well-received by our friends at Tom's Hardware. It offers plenty of speed for a Steam library expansion but with a meager cost per gigabyte of just four cents. It's not the fastest SSD out there, though. Price check: Newegg $92.97 (out of stock) | $144.99 at B&H Photo (out of stock) Silicon Power UD90 | 4 TB | NVMe | PCIe 4.0 | 5,000 MB/s read | 4,500 MB/s write | $239.99 $189.97 at Amazon (save $50.02)This Silicon Power might not be the fastest of drives, but it's difficult to argue with this much storage for this sort of money. With a sequential read/write of 5,000 MB/s and 4,500 MB/s, it's still not what you'd call slow and should be fine for gaming; plus it comes from a reliable brand. You know what I love most in tech? A piece of kit that punches above its weight class, something that delivers build quality and great value. That's where I am with the Corsair TC100 Relaxed gaming chair. Is it the outright best place to park your butt when gaming? No, those are more expensive. But it is a really, really good chair. And what's more it's still retaining its Black Friday discount being just $180 at Best Buy. And Corsair. And B&H Photo. In fact, it's only not on Amazon because it had a run on the chairs and now it's out of stock, which is the second time in a week that it's gone out of stock at the retailer. Which is the best part of this particular deal. Not only is it a great product, and not only is it available at an unprecedentedly low price, but it's also available at that price in three separate locations, which gives me hope that anyone who wants one has a good chance of being able to buy one at this discounted price. Corsair TC100 | Fabric and leatherette | $249.99 $179.99 at Best Buy (save $70)The TC100 is our favorite affordable gaming chair right now, following up on the popular T3 Rush with a great look and genuine comfort. You can read more in our review. Right now, even with only a light discount, it's a truly excellent gaming chair that's cheaper than most of its competition. Price check: Corsair $179.99 | B&H Photo $179.99 | Amazon $179.99 (sold out) Okay, so it's not specifically a 'deal' but if you're at all interested in VR this is where the smart money goes. The Meta Quest 3S is the best-value gateway to virtual reality, being essentially an updated version of the classic Quest 2 for around the same money. Representing more of a step up, however, is the Quest 3, which ups the ante again for comfort and visuals. I think, even at its $500 price tag, it's a good price for the best VR headset around. So much so, that I bought one for my wonderful big brother's birthday; happy birthday, Rich! 🎁 I would absolutely recommend getting a new head strap, though, because the basic ones are pretty rubbish. Meta Quest 3S | 1832 x 1920 per eye | 72 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz | Inside-out tracking | $299 at AmazonIn our Meta Quest 3S review, we praise this little VR headset's great processor, price, and stable tracking. It is missing a 3.5 mm jack, comes with a lower base storage, and the screen is the same as the second-generation model (which is noticeably worse than the Quest 3) but these are the main places you will notice the over $200 price difference. If you order with the code 'QUEST100' at checkout on December 1, you'll also get a $100 digital credit for Amazon, which is pretty sweet, and the bundle comes with Batman: Arkham Shadow and 3 months of Meta Quest+. Price check: Best Buy $299.99 (doesn't come with digital credit) Meta Quest 3 | 2064 x 2208 per eye | 72 Hz, 80 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz | Inside-out tracking | $499.99 at AmazonWith great tracking, a strong mobile chip, and dual LCD pancake lenses, the Meta Quest 3 is the strongest VR headset the company currently offers. Unfortunately, there is no Cyber Monday sale for it but it's already an impeccably well-valued headset, being the best VR headset for gaming right now. Though not a new offering, buying a Meta Quest 3 also gets you Batman: Arkham Shadow and 3 months of Meta Quest+, Meta's monthly game subscription service. Price check: Best Buy $499.99 There were some outstanding screens on offer over Black Friday, and I'm happy to report that three of our favorite OLED gaming monitors over that time are still on offer over the weekend. They all fill a spot in our Cyber Monday gaming monitor deals hub, and offer different displays for different kinds of gamer. But, crucially, they're all three OLED panels for under $900, which is testament to how the market has developed over the past year. There are two ultrawide monitors, one a 34-incher and the other ultrawiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide, at 49-inches. Then there is my personal favorite, the 32-inch 4K OLED from MSI for $700 at Amazon. That would be where my would go, because I love the 4K OLED I'm using at the moment, and I think it's a great panel. MSI MAG 341CQP | 34-inch | 3440 x 1440 | 175 Hz | QD-OLED | Curved | $779.99 $575.99 at Amazon (save $204)OLED gaming still isn't as affordable as we'd like. But it's getting there. This 34-inch ultrawide QD-OLED beast is still a good deal at this price, however. The 175 Hz refresh is a tiny bit pedestrian, but it's plenty fast enough for us and, in all other regards, this is the full OLED experience, including 0.03 ms response time and serious HDR sizzle. Price check: Newegg $599.99 MSI MAG 321UP | 32-inch | 4K | 165 Hz | QD-OLED | $829.99 $699.99 at Amazon (save $130)What a difference a letter makes... especially when it comes to gaming monitors. The code names given to monitors are often impenetrable, but the difference between this MAG 321UP and the MAG321UPX is that this one has a 165 Hz refresh instead of 240 Hz. That's the only difference between this and the more expensive one. If you're not concerned about the refresh rate difference (and do you have the hardware to hit a matching 240 fps otherwise?) then this is where the smart OLED money is spent. Price check: Newegg $699.99 Gigabyte Aorus CO49DQ | 49-inch | 5120 x 1440 | 144Hz | QD-OLED | Curved | $1,099.99 $899.99 at Amazon (save $200)It's not been around for long but the Aorus CO49DQ already has a decent discount, and it's a lot of monitor for the money as we found in our review. Those rocking the RTX 4090 might be better off with the higher refresh rate of the Samsung Odyssey G9 G93SC, but the rest of us can take advantage of this very wide, very pretty looking panel for a bit less.Price check: Best Buy $899.99 If you want to do a Bane and "go mobile" you could do a lot worse than the handheld gaming PCs still on offer as we come into Cyber Monday. Batman's Bane? Too obscure? Ah, I'm going to run with it. Two of the best gaming handhelds are rocking a hefty discount right now, with the LCD Steam Deck available for a stunningly cheap, almost Nintendo Switch-level price at $337 from Steam. There's also our top pick overall, the ROG Ally X, for $700 at Best Buy right now, and it's older sibling is $485 at Amazon. Those two handhelds essentially use the same APU, so will deliver similar performance, but the Ally X is the better of the two, with a better screen, better cooling, and a much bigger battery. But the old ROG Ally, with the Z1 Extreme chip, was still a good device... so long as you didn't use an SD card with it. They were prone to, erm, breaking. Just make sure you go for the one with the Z1 Extreme chip in it, not the straight Ryzen Z1 chip. That version of the Ally is also on sale for what looks like a good price, but the difference between the two chips is such that I wouldn't want the lower-spec Ally even at its deal price. I'd absolutely go with the Steam Deck over the Z1 Ally. Price watch:➖Steam Deck (LCD) | 512 GB SSD | SteamOS | $449 $336.75 at Steam (save $112.25)Okay, the Steam Deck may have had an OLED refresh and there are heaps of more powerful handhelds around, but the original version is still the archetype of what a mobile PC gaming device should be. It's just as powerful as the most recent model so all those Steam Deck compatible games should run well. It's the OG PC gaming handheld, and it still demands respect. At the very least because SteamOS is wicked and it's extremely affordable with this deal (which goes on until December 4 if you want more time to think). Price watch: 🔽Lenovo Legion Go | Z1 Extreme | 8.8-inch screen | 16 GB RAM | 512 GB SSD | $699.99 $472.97 at Amazon (save $227.02)The Legion Go is one of the more polished handhelds on the market, with a sleek 8.8-inch screen and detachable controllers. That screen is a little overkill for the lil' AMD chip inside this machine, the Z1 Extreme also found in the ROG Ally, but it's great for playing indies on while relaxing. One of the controllers also becomes a mouse if you need it, which is a bit of a gimmick but works pretty well. Price check: Newegg $499.99 | Best Buy $549.99 Price watch: ➖ROG Ally | Z1 Extreme | 7-inch screen | 16 GB RAM | 512 GB SSD | $589.99 $485 at Amazon (save $104.99)The original ROG Ally—still a strong performer even next to its improved sibling, the ROG Ally X. That's because they are both powered by the same Z1 Extreme chip from AMD. Considering the money off the original Ally, there's something to be said for choosing this over the X, though the bigger battery life on the X is definitely a huge improvement. Price check: Best Buy $499.99 Price watch: ➖ROG Ally X | Z1 Extreme | 7-inch screen | 24 GB RAM | 1 TB SSD | $799.99 $699.99 at Best Buy (save $100)The ROG Ally X is a little bit too new to receive a massive discount. However, as our pick as the best handheld gaming PC to buy right now, even a $100 off is worth mentioning. Combining a generous helping of RAM, which really matters with an APU, alongside a 1 TB SSD and awesome form factor, the ROG Ally X is top of the charts for a reason. Price check: Asus $799.99 There are some deals I'm particularly happy about them having survived Black Friday and still being on offer over Cyber Monday and into Cyber Week. This being one of them. I love the Mountain Everest 60 keyboard, and I've played with every enthusiast keeb going, yet this is still the one I come back to. ☝️ That's me cradling my own Everest 60 looking tired because I am still live blogging deals. Over Black Friday it was $40 for Amazon Prime Members, but now it $40 at Amazon for everyone. So, everyone should buy one. Though the older TKL Everest board is also on offer for $40 at the Mountain store, and there's the full-fat Everest Max, with all the wrist rest, numpad, and controller extras included for $80, too. That was a nigh $300 kit when it launched, btw. Mountain Everest 60 | Mechanical | 60% | RGB | $69.99 $39.99 at Amazon (save $30)The Mountain Everest 60 is a perfect example of not having to spend a lot to get a cracking keyboard. Not only does it have hot-swappable switches and RGB, it's also wonderful to type on thanks to a plethora of enthusiast design choices such as great foam dampening, pre-lubed switches, and PBT keycaps. Oh, and you can snap on modular magnetic upgrades down the line, too, such a a numpad. This is the absolute cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop I've ever seen. The Lenovo LOQ range of laptops was always meant to be its more budget oriented line of gaming laptops, but they launched at a price that just didn't make sense considering their constraints. But we've seen some good discounts on them over Black Friday, and now this is probably my favorite Cyber Monday gaming laptop deal, and it's not even Monday yet. The miserly 512 GB SSD is pretty Scrooge-like, but aside from that the spec on offer here is outstanding for the money, and will make a fantastic gaming machine for someone. The RTX 4070 is a genuine 115 W version, so a very capable pixel pusher, and I've always been a big fan of Lenovo's laptop keyboards; they the best in the business. It's a win from me. Lenovo LOQ 15ARP9 | RTX 4070 | Ryzen 7 7435HS | 15.6-inch | 144 Hz | 16 GB RAM | 512 GB SSD | $1,199.99 $879.99 at Walmart (save $320)This is the cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop I've seen so far this Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. Not only that, but it doesn't entirely suck in other ways. There's a reasonable amount of dual-channel memory and a speedy IPS screen. The 512 GB SSD does, however, suck, but you can easily upgrade it with the spare NVMe slot inside. iBuyPower is currently sitting pretty atop our guide to the best gaming PC you can buy right now, and it's also got a full suite of fantastic offers we've just dropped into our Cyber Monday gaming PC deals hub. We've had its rigs on this list for the super budget RTX 4060 machines over the Black Friday period, but here I want to highlight the more powerful, but still almost affordable gaming PCs it has on discount at the moment. Just don't forget the sneaky BLACKFRIDAY promo code for the big added discounts on the list price you'll see on the iBuyPower site. iBuyPower RDY Slate 8MP 002 | Core i7 14700KF | Nvidia RTX 4070 Super | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $1,999 $1,399 at iBuyPower (save $600 with code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout)Yes, you can find a cheaper RTX 4070 build right now, but not one that's as well-rounded as this one. With this one, you're getting an up-to-date platform with a fast CPU (ensure it has the latest BIOS, though), 32 GB of fast RAM, and 2 TB of storage. Noice. iBuyPower RDY Y60 005 | Core i9 14900KF | Nvidia RTX 4070 Super | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $2,299 $1,599 at iBuyPower (save $700 with code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout)This one's for those of you who expect to be doing some serious creative or productivity work alongside your gaming. That's because in addition to the RTX 4070 Super that's the heart of this PC's gaming chops, plus its 2 TB of storage and 32 GB of fast RAM, there's also a hefty 14900KF working as its brain. Make extra sure its BIOS is up to date, and then get churning through any CPU-heavy task you desire. iBuyPower RDY Lancool 005 | Core i9 14900KF | Nvidia RTX 4080 Super| 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $2,799 $2,099 at iBuyPower (save $700 with code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout)Not only is this a great deal on an RTX 4080 Super build at not too far north of $2,000, but it's also an incredibly well-rounded one. We're talking 32 GB of snappy DDR5 RAM, 2 TB of storage (which is the ideal capacity for all but ultra-high-end or budget builds), and, most importantly, a 24-core i9 14900KF. Just make sure the PC's BIOS is up to date to prevent any Intel voltage funkiness. iBuyPower RDY Y70 TI B02 | Core i9 14900KF | Nvidia RTX 4090 | 64 GB DDR5-6000 | 4 TB (2x2 TB) SSD | $3,999 $3,299 at iBuyPower (save $700 with code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout)Here we have something I can only describe as a behemoth, a mighty specimen whose name is overkill. 24-core CPU? Check. Most powerful graphics card on the market? Check. Double the RAM and storage of most expensive gaming PCs? Yep, check that, too. The only downside is this one doesn't come with the screen on the chassis that the Y70 04 above does. But that's a matter of preference anyway, I suppose. We have seen some cheaper RTX 4060-powered gaming PCs over Black Friday, but they're all out of stock right now. There are also cheaper options available right now, but none that have a spec that I'm as confident about as this Yeyian machine. It's another Yeyian Tanto gaming PC, for $750 at Newegg, but comes with the 10-core, 14-thread Core i5 13400F. I know there's been a lot made of Intel's troubles with the 13th and 14th Gen chips, but so long as you get your mobo's BIOS updated (as you should anyways) then there won't be any issue with this impressive budget machine. Yeyian Tanto | Core i5 13400F | RTX 4060 | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $1,099 $749.99 at Newegg (save $349.01)This isn't the cheapest RTX 4060 gaming PC we've found this sales season, but this is the one that I'd be buying right now. While the other budget systems are similarly sporting last-gen CPUs, the Core i5 13400F is identical to the 14th Gen alternative, and faster than the Arrow Lake chips for gaming. Paired up with an RTX 4060 and 16 GB of relatively quick DDR5 memory makes this a great budget system. One of those new Cyber Monday gaming laptop deals I was talking about is actually the best-value RTX 4070 machine that I think I've ever seen. I've been working all hours over the past week, so my brain might be a little mushy at this point, but I don't remember seeing another RTX 4070 gaming laptop that I'd actually buy at this price point. The HP Victus 16 is just $930 at Best Buy today. Seriously. There's nothing really that sticks out as a big 🚩either. That RTX 4070 seems to be either a 115 or 120 W TGP, so should be pretty damned performant, and you're getting plenty speed 16 GB of DDR5 memory, too. Obviously that 512 GB is going to be an issue down the line, but the Victus 16 has a spare M.2 easily accessible under the rear casing, so you can just drop in a new 1 or 2 TB SSD as and when you need more space. Price watch: NEW DEAL!HP Victus 16 | Ryzen 7 8845HS | RTX 4070 | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 512 GB SSD | $1,399.99 $929.99 at Best Buy (save $470)This is easily the cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop on the list right now, and the cheapest I think I've ever seen one on sale for. The RTX 4070 isn't a super low spec either, and seems to be a 115 W version. The only real concern I have is that the 512 GB SSD will get filled up fast, but there is a second SSD slot easily accessible in the back of the laptop, so is an easy upgrade. The screen isn't super bright, either, but at 300 nits it will be fine unless you're in a bright office or direct sunlight. Right. Let's have it. Intel's interim CEO suggests Gelsinger's replacement should have chip fabrication experience, giving a glimmer of hope that Intel foundry could remain I really want to believe Intel's claim that the drivers for its new Arc B580 1440p graphics card suffer from 'no known issues of any kind' Caves of Qud review PC Gamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Cyber Monday is ticking towards a close, and Nintendo Switch deals have been flying judging by how many are running out of stock. A lot of the direct discounts on bundles have gone, but there are still some late savings about, including some great deals on Nintendo Switch games. - Quick links- Console deals- Game deals- Accessory deals- Live updates As often with Switch, many of the best deals are in the UK, where you can get a Switch Lite bundle with Animal Crossing: New Horizons and 12 months of Nintendo Switch online down from £199 to £189. You can also get a Switch OLED console alone for £229 at On Buy – super close to the lowest price I've seen. Keep checking our blog below for live updates on the latest Cyber Monday Nintendo Switch games, accessories and console deals as soon as we spot them. And for advice, see our Nintendo Switch vs Switch OLED piece. Most of the bundle deals we're seeing in the US right now are out of stock, but we're checking them regularly and will let you know if any re-appear. This bundle deal is one of the best we've seen this Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend, and while it's out of stock at both Target and Walmart, it keeps coming back every so often. The bundle includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe + 12 months of Switch online membership, which gets you access to hundreds of games from Nintendo's back catalogue. Price check: $349.99 at Amazon $299.99 at Amazon There's no direct cash saving here, but you get Mario Kart 8 Deluxe thrown in for the normal price of the standard Switch console alone. Price check: $299.99 at Nintendo Save £118.46: This is one of the best OLED deals I've seen as it includes one of Nintendo's best games - Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - and its Booster Course Pass worth £22.49, as well as 12 months subscription to Nintendo Online. Price check: Amazon £429.99 Save £10: This is only £10 off the usual retail price but that's better than nothing right now, considering that Switch deals are selling out pretty rapidly across the UK right now. Save £10 PLUS added value: We rarely see discounts on the Switch Lite model, so any deal no matter how small should be seen as a win. While this deal says it's only £10 off, there is actually plenty more value in this bundle. It includes a download code for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, one of the most popular Switch games played during lockdown, PLUS 12 months of Switch Online included. Save $10 PLUS added value: Again, this might not seem like a very big bundle discount initially, but there is extra value here that you may not notice. You get the Sports bundle + 12 months of Switch Online. A new console is usually £250 on its own, so these are just extra free perks. Save £70: This is a genuinely good deal, that's been running all week, but it's fluctuating quite a bit. Since our last update, the price has increased by £1, but this console deal remains a brilliant price (the lowest was £220 earlier in the week). Price check: Amazon £279 | Argos: £279.99 Save $20: Legend of Zelda is a game that unites the generations like no other, and Link is back in Tears of the Kingdom to defend Hyrule against malevolent forces with new abilities to explore. Target was beating this deal with $30 off on Black Friday. That deal's gone, but this is still one of the best discounts we've seen. Price Check: $52.99 (European version) at Amazon Best UK price: $44.99 at Amazon Save 64%: This is one of the best games on Nintendo Switch, and I scored it 5/5 in my Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review; for this price there's no excuse not to own one of the console's best Metroidvanias. Save $20: This is one of the most popular games right now across all platforms (not just the Nintendo Switch) and it's easy to see why. This new SEGA action-adventure title teams up old Sonic generations to defeat Dr. Eggman and Time Eater in a timeline-saving dash. My favourite is the Pinball challenge in the casino zone. Price Check: $29.99 at Best Buy | $30 at Walmart Save 49%: The successor to last year's mega-hit, FC 24, this new videogame instalment replaces what we all used to know as FIFA, and celebrates one of the world's biggest sports. It's almost half off, which makes it super tempting for football fans. Save $35: One of the most popular video game characters of all time, Sonic the Supersonic Hedgehog is back in this exhilarating adventure across the five Starfall Islands. Price Check: $31.99 at Best Buy | $39.99 at Target SAVE $30: Anime fans will love this one from Bandai Namco. Experience a new adventure as Luffy: search for the Straw Hats and get your crew back together while scouting mysterious islands and dungeons with a twist. The deal on the digital game. Price Check: $47.45 at Amazon Save 57%: Officially licensed for Nintendo Switch, this is a sweet deal on an unsexy but very useful SD card. It has dropped lower before (to $8.99 actually) but this still a marvellous price. Also available discounted at Best Buy in multiple storage sizes. Save 25%: The Turtle Beach Recon 50 is the best value headset for Nintendo Switch from this well-regarded brand. Perfect for online games of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. And we're off on yet ANOTHER Nintendo Switch live blog - our fifth year of blogging and my sixth of covering Nintendo Switch sales. I say this to let you know you're in the best possible hands here. We'll be sharing all our expert advice and insider knowledge on whether the deals you see are genuinely worth your time, and to let you know when to pull the trigger (press the mouse? trackpad? It's been a long weekend) on that deal you've been eyeing up. I'm really not exaggerating when I say that the Nintendo Switch deals we've seen this year have been the best I've ever seen during Black Friday. They're so good I was actually surprised. But they are going in and out of stock, so it's important to grab one where you can. Okay stand by and we'll get into this for real. Here's a picture of Mario as an elephant. Just because I can. Nintendo Switch OLED Model: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle: $349 $275 at Target So. What have we got? Well, we've got a fabulous bundle deal from Target, which sets the Switch OLED at a record-low price of $275 BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. That deal has $79 of added value in the form of Mario Kart Deluxe 8 and 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online membership. So actually you're getting total savings of $144. What do you get with that membership? You get access to hundreds, yes hundreds of titles in Nintendo's back catalogue, plus some Sega titles too. I absolutely love retro games (the day they veered from platform gaming was a sad one for me, I don't have the spatial awareness) and so this is a real pull for me. If I was in the US I'd grab this deal immediately. It's in and out of stock at Target, and available in store only at best Buy. Get a taster of the game below: For UK Switch fans, we've been highlighting the same deal all week – this one that puts it at (currently) £228 at OnBuy. It's been changing in price a bit - the lowest we saw was £220 and it has gone up to £232 so don't be surprised to see it either sell out or get more expensive. If you'd prefer Amazon, you'll need to pay a bit extra - the OLED console is currently £274. Surprisingly for Amazon, there haven't been oodles of Switch deals on consoles. But the giant has had some great game deals, and accessories too which we will keep you posted on. WHO WILL WIN THE RACE for the lowest price? See what I did there with the Sonic image below? Great. Morning, it's Tech Reviews Editor Erlingur here, I'll be escorting you through the magical kingdom of Nintendo Switch deals for the next couple of hours. As someone who has loved Nintendo ever since encountering Super Mario and Duck Hunt with my first NES wayyyyy back in 1989, I'm looking forward to this time with you. Usually, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are a frustrating hunting ground for Nintendo Switch deals (we've got a six-year track record of striving to find gems in the often-barren desert), but this year seems different, with lots and lots of great deals on consoles and games alike. And I've already spotted a verrrrry nice one... I know Nintendo is the Realm of Mario, but I've always loved a bit of Sonic the Hedgehog, and right now, there's not one, not two, but THREE Cyber Monday deals on Sonic games at Amazon. So if you, and your 8-year-old son (like mine, incidentally), are both Sonic nutters, why save $20 off one Nintendo Switch Sonic game, when you can save a combined $41.25 on three of them? I haven't played Frontiers myself, but massively enjoyed Superstars and Sonic X Shadow Generations (my kid is a big Shadow fan), so these offers all get the thumbs up from us two experts. Listen up, UK deal hunters. Finding big discounts on Switch consoles is always hard, but there is real value to be found in bundle deals. And I've found one I particularly like this morning (maybe it's because I'm trying to get fit so I've starting cycling at lunch and stuff), which puts the Switch Neon Red & Blue, Sports & Nintendo Switch Online 12 Month Membership all in one handy package for only £249 at Currys, down from £259. Seeing as the standalone unit costs £250 all on its lonesome, this constitutes A Good Deal if you ask me. I like games, let's find more games deals. The rather fantastic EA Sports FC 25 is almost half-price on Amazon UK right... now. We have played FC 24 to oblivion in this household and considering the reviews for the new'un, this might be the offer that compels me to get this one. My favourite feature in FC 24 was the Career mode, and that's carried over and further developed in FC 25, where you can develop your own superstar in the dog-eat-dog world of professional association football. If, like me, you prefer a 'classic' controller rather than the Nintendo joy-cons, you're probably browsing for some nice Switch controller deals. And there's quite a few available. Perhaps the best-looking one is this Switch-themed controller from well-liked maker Cehensy, and it's a nice 20% off, down to only £17.58 (while it's still in stock, that is, controllers go out of stock real fast). I've used Cehensy controllers in the past, and based on the ones I've used, as well as customer reviews of this one, this controller is an excellent value deal. It's wireless too, which is always nice... Fret not, my American brethren, I haven't forgotten you. I have a sister in Denver, after all. For you, and just you, my beautiful, smart, funny and charming readers, I have found this lowest-ever price for the officially licensed PDP Switch controller. The wireless model is usually $54.99, but for Cyber Monday, it's been knocked down to $49.99, which is the lowest it's ever been. I've got the PDP controller for my PC (Xbox spec), and I absolutely love it. It works fantastically and looks beautiful too, so I have no doubt that the Switch one is as high-quality as that one. There's also a wide selection of colours, so you can find one to fit your interior decor to a tee. Right, while I get some coffee and find the next deal to highlight, please enjoy this new Mario Kart theme from my current content-creator obsession, Carter Vail. Wake up Demon Slayer fans! I have Cyber Monday goody news for you, because Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles for Switch is a big ol' $20 off on Amazon now, down to a equal-to-lowest-ever $39.99, from $59.99. It's overwhelmingly well reviewed, and looks gorgeous too, so get going before it's out of stock, my beautiful cherubs. This morning has been a wild ride, my friends. I'm about to head off (apparently, I have a family and hobbies and shopping and clothes to wash who knew), but I wanted to alert you to a big Best Buy deal on my colleague Kimberly's favourite game: The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Legend of Zelda is a big obsession for many of my friends, and if like Kimberly, you want to get all 1001 korok seeds, hurry up: she's up to 982. Hey deal hunters, it's Ian Dean here, Creative Bloq's Editor, Digital Arts & 3D, I'll be tracking down all the big offers and latest discounts for you on all Nintendo Switch consoles, games and fun stuff.I've been gaming since I could crawl and have been writing about games professionally since 1998, in a past life I sat opposite the Official Nintendo Magazine team has they argued over which Mario game is the best. As I sit here I literally have Metroid Prime Remastered on pause - my own personal Black Friday Switch treat. We're not 'switching' over to Cyber Monday deals, and there can often be some late offers on Nintendo games, accessories and collectibles as we head to the sales end. Stay with me, and we'll find some bargains. To start things off, let's get personal. Not too personal, we don't know one another that well, but below I've found deals on three of my favourite Nintendo Switch games that I play regularly and come highly recommended. At full price these are great, with money off they're even better. Save $32 There's a massive 62% off one of my favourite games on Switch and one of the best Metroidvanias for the console, now just $17.97 at Amazon. Read my Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review. Save $20 Now $59.99 $39.99 at Best Buy. This charming tactical-puzzler in which you guide an army of adorable creatures over obstacles and battles is one of the most original series on Nintendo Switch. Save $20 Another reduced from $59.99 to $39.99 at Best Buy, and it remains one of the console's hidden gems. A platforming classic with a weird sense of humour, you'll love this. Even Nintendo Switch games that only just released can be found with small discounts for Cyber Monday. Below I've listed some eye-catching offers on brand new games, including the adorable The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom and the Tomb Raider Remastered Trilogy, which I bought at launch and comes highly recommended (the final three games release 14 Feb next year in the Tomb Raider IV-V-VI Remastered bundle). It you're thinking of buying a Nintendo Switch in the Cyber Monday sales I'd urge you to sign-up for a Nintendo Online subscription. You can trial three months for free before signing up, but a subscription offers access to hundreds of classic games from Nintendo and Sega, including games released for SNES, Mega Drive, N64 and more. Nintendo regularly updates the list of retro games with new entries, such as Banjo-Tooie, and Sega has just added more to its collection. You can now even play classic game soundtracks with the Nintendo Music app (see below). Find out more on the Nintendo website. One neat deals trick Nintendo Switch owners have long made use of that new owners need to know is the Nintendo Vouchers deal. Nintendo Online subscribers can buy two game vouchers for $99.98 / £84, to spend in the eShop on select games. The hack is games cost $59.99 / £49.99 so you're actually making a saving of around 25%. The best games in the voucher deal include: • Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition• The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom• Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door• Princess Peach: Showtime!• Pikmin 4 UK readers can buy vouchers here. I own a Switch original flavour, from way back, and even though it's brilliant and has saved me on some really dull flights (and post Christmas dinner slump) I'm toying with the idea of buying a Switch OLED today. I don't need a Switch OLED but it's a model the gamer in me wants - we're completists, right? We need the full collection. I've listed the best deal I'd buy / may buy… okay, will buy this Cyber Monday. This is coming home with me. Okay, I don't really want Super Mario Bros. Wonder but my nieces love Nintendo platformers, so I get my Switch OLED and they get a treat. The bundle costs £289.99 at Argos, and considering the OLED alone is £280 at Currys, this is a good deal. Add in a subscription to Nintendo Online, which as I shared earlier is really an entry into Nintendo's back catalogue of hundreds of retro games, deals, voucher offers and more, and this Argos deal is actually incredible value. If you're buying lots of games for Nintendo Switch then you'll need a good microSDXC card to store games and save data. There are some good deals on SanDisk cards for Switch, including Nintendo branded cards, this Cyber Monday, I've listed the best three below: Save 18% This is one of the best cards around, the SanDisk 512GB Extreme microSDXC card is now £42 £35 at Amazon, and it comes with a card reader too. There's also a deal on a two-pack bundle of 64GB SanDisk Extreme cards with a card read, now £28.98 £17.98 at Amazon. Save 15% This SanDisk card comes with Nintendo's branding, which means it's been tested by Nintendo to meet its high standards. This SanDisk 256GB card is now £21.99 £18.68 at Amazon. Save 17% This was £5 cheaper last Tuesday but it's rarely reduced below its RRP all year. This SanDisk card is another one tested and branded by Nintendo for Switch, and comes with the Animal Crossing leaf branding. This Animal Crossing SanDisk card is now £45.99 £37.99 at Amazon. I've just found some of the best Nintendo gifts on Etsy for any retro gamers reading this. A number of sellers have discounts on some eye-catching art prints, including Pop Art style illustrations of iconic Nintendo controllers. Below I've listed my favourites. Gifting online store IWOOT is a treasure trove of Nintendo goodies, present ideas and just weird rarities I never knew I wanted. There are small savings across the board on many of these collectibles, and it's well worth a look if you're struggling for a gift to buy the Ninty-fan in your life (or for you). The deals include £5 off Super Mario Monopoly £35.99 £30.99; it's the classic board game with added Mario. IWOOT also has Mario water bottles, Mushroom alarm clocks, Nintendo Christmas sweaters, Mario notebooks and mugs. The one thing better than finding a deal on a great Nintendo Switch game is finding a deal on a collector's edition. I rarely but collector's edition because they cost so much but on Cyber Monday you can often find a bargain. These special collector's editions include the game but also models, unique boxes and unique extras - they make great gifts. Below I've picked three of my favourite Nintendo Switch game collector's editions, some games are old but the bundles are good (and the best games remain classics and playable long after release - in fact some can be found on the best retro game consoles). Save 29% Was £84.99, now £59.99 at Amazon I grew up on the Turrican series, first playing it on Amiga, and while you can play it on AntStream Arcade, this collection for Nintendo Switch is a wonderful way to discover the classic shooters. This collector's edition features both Volume 1 and Volume 2, which includes every game released, plus an art book, documentary film, posters, stickers, soundtrack and more, all packaged in a designer box. Save 30% Was £49.99, now £34.99 at Amazon Spelunky HD os the remastered version of the breakout indie game that scooped numerous awards on release, and remains a fantastic game. It was originally made usinf GameMaker, the indie game engine. This collector's edition includes the Spelunky HD (which offers 3D or pixel art modes) as well as a specially designed box and art, with a figurine, level guide, soundtrack and more. The Spelunker HD Deluxe - Collector's Edition is limited to 1,300 editions. Save 5% Was £150.23, now £142.75 at Amazon The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom original soundtrack is one of the most popular and beautiful OSTs in gaming, and this collector's edition matches the music. It features 344 songs across nine CDs and comes with a collectible sword-shaped USB and it's all packaged into a striking designer box. Okay, it's not a game, but Zelda fans will adore this edition. Balatro Special Edition is £24.99 £18.99 at Amazon, and I'm surprised. Balatro has been one of the year's more unusual games, but it's also one of the most awarded - and it's in the running to be crowned Game of the Year at the prestious The Game Awards held later this month. What is Balatro? It's an indie card game that mixes poker and and tactical card battling, and it's one of the most addictive games of 2024. When I started blogging about Nintendo Switch Cyber Monday deals today I really didn't expect Balatro to be on sale. The idea one of the biggest games of 2024 is reduced is, well… surprising. But then I did a little research, and it has been reduced before, but never to this low a price. If you're looking for a Nintendo gift and a good deal, then the official Nintendo store is a good place to start. The online store features deals on games and Nintendo Switch consoles but it also sells branded gifts, accessories and merchandise. Below are some of my favourites: Hey gamers, Beth here! I thought I'd quickly introduce myself as I'll be taking over the blog for a while. I've owned my Nintendo Switch console since 2017, and I absolutely love it. I'm a huge Pokémon fan, but my favourite game to play right now is Disney Dreamlight Valley, as it's super chill and I love getting to unwind at the end of the day and complete tasks in my own Disney village. Beth is our Ecommerce Writer, and loves all things tech and gaming. She owns a PlayStation 5, Meta Quest 3, and Nintendo Switch, plus she used to work at a retail games store, so knows everything there is about the best Nintendo Switch prices and trade-in deals. Not to mention, she has a Snorlax tattoo, so if that doesn't scream Nintendo nerd we don't know what does. My first ever Nintendo console was the N64, which was passed onto me by my older brother when I was about 4 years old. I still have it today, and it sits proudly on my gaming shelf with a copy of Pokémon Stadium. I can't believe how expensive it is now to buy a Nintendo 64, although it is considered one of the best retro consoles ever. There are no Cyber Monday deals on the Nintendo 64 (obviously) but if you do fancy a hit of nostalgia you can pick one up for $110 at Amazon, or at Walmart for $114.95, which is actually a much better price than options I've been seeing on sites like eBay and Etsy. My favourite game to play on my retro Nintendo 64 console is Pokémon Snap (maybe that's why I grew up to become a photographer 🤔), and this game was so popular back in the day that they remade it for the Nintendo Switch! The New Pokémon Snap (Nintendo Switch version) is on sale at Amazon right now for $59.99 $49.95, saving you $10 – and I highly recommend it if you love Pokémon games. You need to use your sharp eye to spot Pokémon in their natural habitat doing something interesting and snap a photo to earn a score. It's more fun than it sounds I promise. Keeping with the Pokémon theme, did you know that SanDisk has official Pokémon SD cards for the Nintendo Switch? There's a yellow Pikachu 256GB card, a Gengar 512GB card, and a Snorlax 1TB card which was on sale at Amazon for $134.99 $89.99 during Black Friday (I think this deal has sold out sadly) but you can get it dscounted at Amazon in the UK for £79.99 down from £127.99. I think it's fair to assume that plenty of you reading this will have experienced the dreaded Joy-Con drift (I know I have). If you're hoping to avoid that this Cyber Monday, then definitely take a look at the handy guide I put together on tried and tested Nintendo Switch Joy-Con alternatives that promise absolutely zero stick drift. The pair I own is the NYXI Hyperion Pro, and not only are these controllers gorgeous to look at with colour-changing LED but they operate in the exact same way as official Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons and even have motion controls too. Take a look at my NYXI Hyperion Pro review for all of the details. Need a dock for your Nintendo Switch? Cyber Monday is a great time to shop for Switch accessory deals, and we have a guide to the best Nintendo Switch docks to help you out. A docking station is one of the most essential Nintendo Switch accessories, and is compatible with both the standard Switch and Switch OLED models (but not the Switch Lite). One final accessory I'm recommending for any new Nintendo Switch owners is a case. If you don't already have one, then it's important to get a reliable case for your console to keep your Nintendo Switch display scratch-free, and keep out dust, plus you can also store your cartridges in most cases for safekeeping. The one I have is a leather Snorlax case which I bought on Amazon from a seller named PALPOW, but I think it's currently unavailable in the US and UK. Don't fret, here are five other Nintendo Switch cases that I would recommend below. • PowerA Protection Case • GeekShare Plush Protective Case • PALPOW Mario Switch Case • HORI Premium Vault Case • Tomtoc Switch Lite Case If you're looking for some creative Nintendo stocking fillers in time for Christmas this year, we have a guide to the best Nintendo Stocking fillers for the gamers in your life. I really want the Lego Piranha Plant for my desk at home, and I think it would make an amazing gift for anyone wanting a unique office accessory (who needs a real houseplant when you have this?). There are tons of other options in the guide to suit a range of ages and budgets, so be sure to check it out if you need a gift to go along with your Nintendo Switch console purchase. Hiya! It's Editor Georgia back again for an evening of deal hunting. I'm seeing so many standout deals sold out now, or returning to the usual price. This could mean an influx of new deals is set to drop – or it could be game over for Switch deals. In my experience, the kind of deal we saw this year (namely that $275 bundle deal that's now back to $349) will be limited. Not that I have much experience of that becuse normally there is very little to work with. But my guess it that that brilliant deal is over now because it would have been so popular! But I'll be happy to be wrong on this occasion. If tomorrow dawns and there are a whole host of new deals I'll be delighted to share them. It is worth noting that Amazon didn't take part in that big price slash. while Best Buy, Target AND Walmart did... Could the retail giant have something up its sleeve for tomorrow? If you've got this far you're likely to know which console you want. But if you're on the fence, or you're finding it hard to match your gaming priorities with your budget, then you'll want to read some stellar advice, I expect. For example, might it be worth dropping under the $200/£200 mark to get the Switch lite? If you're happy to keep your console in hand rather than play as a group through your TV then that might be a compromise you're willing to make. Are you happy with a slightly older, less flashy model? You could possibly be satisfied with the standard Switch console. Read 7 things to consider before buying a Switch here, and learn all about it. Not totally sure how to use the Switch to its fullest capabilities? We've put together some handy tips and tricks for you to boost your gameplay. 12 pointers, in fact. From how to save battery life to customising your home screen, there are a bunch of useful ideas here for optimising your experience with the Switch. Find out our 12 tips for getting the most out of the Switch. I've just found a brilliant non-Switch deal I actually want to tell you about. We've recommended the sale price on the Sonic X Shadow Switch game above, but what about a Shadow the Hedgehog Lego set?! Target has got a stellar 30% off that set right now, saving you $21 and bringing it to $48.99. It's a really fun Shadow the Hedgehog head – and is the perfect gift for a Sonic fan (or yourself). You could build it then look admiringly at it while playing the associated game on your brand new Switch! There's a plan. There's also a really nice Mario Wonder OLED bundle deal at Argos if you're in the UK. You can get the OLED console plus the Super Mario Bros. Wonder game and that great Switch Online membership I've been banging on about for £289.99. There's a lot of added value here that could make it a viable alternative to that other UK deal from On Buy. If you're wanting a game to play, in fact hundreds of games, then this is the one for you. You'll only end up spending about that much on a similar amount of content if you go for a standalone console. I remember back in 2021, an engineer made a GIANT Nintendo Switch. It was incredible. And that is how big the Switch looms in my brain after the whole weekend deal hunting. It was a fully working Switch that was 650% larger than a normal console! That means it was 70 inches wide and 30 inches tall... and it weighted an epic 29.5kg. It even had a 4K display. Pretty amazing if you wanted a cinema-like Nintendo Switch experience, eh? Read all about the giant Switch here. And watch the video below! I love how casually Nintendo announced the Switch 2. Just a little tweet, that's all it took to announce the biggest development in gaming handhelds, and one we were waiting for for years! Read all about the announcement here. Would I still recommend buying the Switch in the light of the news? Well, yes actually I would. But only the OLED and the Lite. I don't think there's a point in buying the standard console, unless you're on a very tight budget. Give it's eight years old I think you'd be better off spending a bit more to get the OLED Switch. And if I'm really honest I think they might discontinue that original one next year to realign the range. I just got stuck in a little hole of looking through the concepts people made back when the Switch 2 was going to be called the Switch Pro (in our heads anyway) and we had NO idea what it would be like, or when it was coming. We covered some of those concepts in news pieces. The first is a render made by Zone of Tech: We see what they did there. Kinda like a Lite but with zingier colours. And isn't this one delightful? I'd totally buy a purple Switch, though I know that's not the point at all. That screen looks like it's hiding some gorgeous graphics. Of course you could always opt for a refurbished Switch if you wanted to save some extra pennies, and think about the environment, too. Most retailers have certified renewed models, often with warranties for a year or more. These are often returned devices that have been wiped clean and spruced up by a very capable tech team. You can even buy these direct from Nintendo and if that doesn't give you peace of mind, nothing will. Find renewed Nintendo Switch Lite consoles for $169, OLED from $319 and the standard Switch from $259.99. Hi guys, it's Beth again 👋 Inspired by Georgia's post below about the Shadow the Hedgehog Lego set, I've found some super cool deals on Mega Blocks Pokémon sets over at Amazon that I think could make excellent stocking fillers for gamers 🎮 These Pokémon sets aren't officially Lego-branded, but instead are classed as MEGA Bloks which is a different brand owned by Mattel. I actually own two of these Pokémon Lego-alternative sets already, the Snorlax and Jumbo Pikachu sets, and they're really fun and challenging to build. You can find a few other options in a previous deals roundup I made a while back. Save 16% Was $58.99, now $49.50 at Amazon Save 38% Was $99.99, now $61.59 at Amazon Save $67 Was $171.99, now $104.99 at Amazon What else can I tell you about the Nintendo Switch? Probably not much that you don't already know. Although, I did recently learn that you can use a Nintendo Switch with compatible AR Smart glasses. These are essentially wearable monitors that let you experience gameplay on a cinema-sized screen, which would be perfect for situations when you're without a screen or Nintendo Switch dock, like when travelling on a plane. If you're interested, I've rounded up some Cyber Monday deals on Smart Glasses that actually tempted me to buy a pair. One of the worst things about owning a Nintendo Switch is the dreaded Joy-Con drift. I'm sure most Switch gamers have experienced this at some point, or if you haven't, then count yourself lucky. Stick drift is a very common issue where joysticks tend to shift out of place over time, so it's as if your character is moving on its own (or something else is happening on screen) that isn't your doing. There are plenty of newer controllers and joypads on the market that are now swapping out analogue sticks for what's known as hall effect joysticks instead, which promise absolutely zero stick drift. I've put together a guide of the best Joy-Con alternatives full of controllers that will work with your Nintendo Switch console, but never develop stick drift. Thank me later. Okay gamers, It's just past 1am in the UK right now which means it's officially Cyber Monday! I'm signing off for the night, but stick with us (and this blog) first thing tomorrow to be kept in the loop about any fresh Nintendo Switch Cyber Monday deals as soon as we spot them. Good morning, Dan here taking over the Nintendo Switch live blog. But first, I'd like to wish a very happy Cyber Monday to all who celebrate. I certainly do – I'm wearing my Cyber Monday jumper and hat as we speak, and was made sure to wish everybody I passed on my commute to the office a friendly 'Cyber greetings'. Now, let's Switch (lol!) to the matter at hand. Since we left you, the Nintendo Switch deals landscape has changed, with old deals dying and new sprouting. I'll be bringing you all the latest info this morning, so keep your eyes peeled on this blog, and the deals information above. In the UK, Amazon is currently offering a renewed Nintendo Switch Lite for £149.99, down from the RRP of £199. Amazon's renewed models are almost as good as brand new. Amazon says these are "inspected, tested and cleaned in accordance with Amazon Renewed requirements to be fully functional." Animal Crossing arrived on the Switch at just the right time. With the world plunged into lockdown, this cosy universe offered a welcome break from those unprecedented times, with millions diving head-first into the game. It's still a delight, and right now in the UK, Argos is offering an Animal Crossing bundle with the Switch Lite and 12 months of Nintendo Switch online, down from £199 to £189. In previous years we might have suggested holding on before committing to buying a Switch OLED – but in 2024 things are different. With the Switch landscape about to change with the advent of the Nintendo Switch 2 (or is that Switch Pro?) – here's why. One of the best deals we've seen this Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend is $50 off the Nintendo Switch OLED bundle featuring Mario Kart 8 and 12 months of Nintendo Switch online. This deal is out of stock at Target, but Walmart has just brought it back, with the bundle down to $299. This one won't be hanging around for long. You know what I think the best thing is about the Nintendo Switch? You can play Goldeneye on it. The 1997 N64 game has a special place in my heart, as I spent countless hours on it as a wee lad. For decades the only way to play it again was to dust off an old N64, but Goldeneye finally hit Nintendo Switch Online last year. And with that $50 off OLED deal at Walmart, you get 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online thrown in. Rumours about the Nintendo Switch 2 have been hotting up for what feels like forever, but it's sounding like the souped-up Switch sequel might finally appear at the start of next year. For every rumour in one place, take a look at our main Nintendo Switch 2 page. We're not seeing many Switch deals in the UK, but right now you can bag the Switch Lite for $185, a saving of $15. Which is better than nothing, right? Right? Hey, it's Ian here now, taking over from Georgia. I'm Creative Bloq's Editor, Digital Art and 3D and spend my time writing about all things, well… digital art and 3D, including game art, game design and reviewing Switch games.In a past life I was editor of Official PlayStation Magazine and have been writing about video games professionally since 1998, when Nintendo, Sony and Sega we're going head to head. But you're here for Nintendo Switch deals, and I'm going to find you some good ones, I promise. After yesterday's deals search I ended up buying House of the Dead Remake for my Switch, so let me just pause it and start the deals search. Get Nintendo SwitchSports + Super Mario Party Jamboree + Nintendo Online at Very, for £308.99 £289 (save £19.99). I literally bought the Nintendo Switch Sports bundle last year and now you can get it for less, with Super Mario Party Jamboree included and Nintendo Online added, too. So, of course I'd recommend this deal. If you have kids, nieces and nephews, or grandchildren this is a great bundle as both the included games are designed for the family and multiplayer. (And Nintendo Online offers access to hundreds of free retro games so oldies like me can settle in to a Metroid marathon on Boxing Day.) The thing I love about Nintendo Switch is its handheld mode - and in all honesty, it's the way most of us play on the console. While I buy a lot of games over the eShop these days, it's still nice to have a collection of physical games, especially when travelling and access to WiFi can be limited. So below I've found the three best Nintendo Switch case deals available right now for Cyber Monday. Each has storage for the console, leads and game cards. Save 24% Was $19.91, now $15.19 at Amazon This case for Nintendo Switch features a protective hardshell outer case, with pockets for spare controllers, cables and a couple of cards. It's water-resistant and designed like an official Nintendo case. Save 40% Was $12.59, now $7.58 at Amazon Every Nintendo Switch owner needs a dedicated game card wallet, and this one from FYY is a good choice and has a whopping 40% off the retail price. It can store 24 game cards and 48 micro SD cards, so you never misplace a game. Save 25% Was $19.99, now $14.99 at Amazon Made from premium materials, including a ballistic outer hardshell case, this is fully licensed and tested by Nintendo for use with all Switch consoles. It even features a viewing stand and comes with extra game cases. This is the #1 selling Switch case in the USA and it's reduced for Cyber Monday. I just spied Nintendo's free gift! If you spend more than £70 on the Nintendo Store over Cyber Monday you get a free Mario holiday ornament to hang on the Christmas tree. Visit the Nintendo Store and claim your free ornament with orders over £90. Want the free Mario Christmas tree ornament from my previous post? Then I've found the best buys from the Nintendo Store that will take you just over the £70 fresh hold to earn your treat. Free gifts This game isn't on sale but if you buy it now on Cyber Monday it comes with some free Nintendo goodies, including Super Mario Party Jamboree themed Coaster Set, snack bowl and blanket. At £74.49 it just creeps above Nintendo's margin to earn the Mario ornament. The cutely named Alarmo is a clock like no other, it features a digital display that can be programmed to reflect your favourite Nintendo games, and includes Nintendo's unique fonts and 35 themed alarms. It also has sensors to note when you move and are awake. The collector's statue features Link from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and comes with a Sheikah Slate, Ancient Arrow and base that all feature LED functions. The statue us packaged in a collector's box. Turtle Beach make some of the best headsets for gaming, and the widely loved Turtle Beach Recon 50 is on sale for Cyber Monday. Unlike other brands, this affordable headset comes in the Nintendo Switch colours. If you don't want to spend too much on a gaming headset but want quality the Turtle Beach Recon 50 is a good buy. There's 35% off Turtle Beach Recon 50 at Amazon: £19.99 £13.99 US readers - if you want a set of Turtle Beach headphones for Nintendo Switch then there are a couple of good dealsI can recommend. While Turtle Beach Recon 50 isn't on offer in the US, two other models are. I've set the deals out below. The best Nintendo Switch games on sale for under $40 Getting or have a Nintendo Switch? Then below are my pick of the best games under $40 this Cyber Monday, including some classics, hidden gems and more. I've played these games, so they're recommended personally. (Including the GTA Trilogy that recently received an update that fixes its visuals, bugs and added new features like 'classic lighting mode'.) That last games round up was fun, let's see if I can find enough good Switch games under $10? What do you think? Is it possible? I did buy House of the Dead: Remake for $24.99 on Saturday, so maybe it's possible. Challenge accepted. The best Nintendo Switch games under $20, available now. Save 53% Was $39.99, now $18.74 The Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 features three of PlayStation's best games on Nintendo Switch. Plus this collection features the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear for NES, as well as documentary and other extras. Save 60% Was $49.99, now $19.99 The recently released Just Dance 2025 Edition – Limited Edition has never been priced this low before. This series has been hugely popular ever since release, and a great game to play with the kids on Christmas Day. This Limited Edition comes with cosmetic extras. Save 50% Was $39.99, now $19.99 Being a huge fan of The Karate Kid and retro games it's kind of hard not pass up on this on this deal. Game Mill's new pixel art brawler draws inspiration from classic games like Renegade and Double Dragon, as well as characters and scenes from the films (now a Netflix show). There are Cyber Monday deals on some fun Nintendo-themed merchandise, including deals on Paladone gifts, collectibles and more. Take a look below at some of my favourite offers: If you're looking for a fun Nintendo Switch accessory this Cyber Monday, might I recommend this BMO Switch dock from Amazon? Modelled after the loveable Adventure Time character. I own this dock myself and I love it, but it's more of a stand really than a working dock, as there are no slots for connecting peripherals. In other words, it's an excellent stand for keeping your Switch sturdy while you play in tabletop mode, but it's no good for connecting your console to the TV. There are 3 colour options to choose from, Blue, Orange or Pink – and each option is reduced to only $16.73 for Cyber Monday, down from $24.98, saving you $8.25. Not a big fan of the official Joy-Con controllers that come with your Nintendo Switch? There are plenty of other (and much better) options out there for a more comfortable gaming experience. One of the most popular Joy-Con alternatives is the CRKD Nitro Deck, which is essentially a dock that your Nintendo Switch display slots into. It's classy in black, but also comes in other variants to give your console that retro aesthetic should you choose. The CRKD Nitro Deck is on sale this Cyber Monday for $69.99 $49.99 over at Amazon in the US, and for £37.49 at Amazon in the UK. If you like your controllers separate from your Switch display, then another Joy-Con alternative to consider is the NYXI Hyperion Pro. I've personally reviewed this controller (or controllers should I say, since they come in a pair), and it functions exactly the same as official Nintendo Joy-Cons but with a chunkier design, and colour-changing LED lights for that neon gamer aesthetic that we all love. Take a look at my NYXI Hyperion Meteor and NYXI Hyperion Pro reviews for all of the details. Hello there! Hi there deal hunters! It's Rosie Hilder here, logging on shortly before I finish my shift. I'm gonna have a quick look around to check if any more offers have appeared and I'll be back shortly with my findings. Should you buy a deal right now if you see it? We'll be honest with you, yes. We've seen stock running out across various bundle deals so if you see something you like, we advise you to go for it. It's across the US that we're seeing most sold out bundle deals. In the UK there are still some offers available. My favourite is this Nintendo Switch Lite Animal Crossing Bundle, which comes with a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online membership, which gives you access to some fantastic classic games. Get the Switch Lite Animal Crossing bundle for £199 £189 at Argos The best Nintendo Switch game deal of all Black Friday and Cyber Monday was The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for just $39.99 at Target. That deal's now gone sadly, but the next best thing is a saving of $20 on the digital edition of the game at Best Buy. It's still one of the best deals we've seen on a title that continues to top our pick of the best Nintendo Switch games. Over in the UK, the best price on Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is £44.99 at Amazon and at Currys, a saving of £10. Direct savings on Switch consoles are few and far between now as Cyber Monday proceedings creep towards a close. I have noticed this small saving on the standard Switch in grey, though. It's not really a discount to shout about, but it's something at least if you want the console in that colour. In the UK, Cyber Monday is very nearly over, so let's round up what's left at... Very. There are still a couple of bundle deals as well as savings on games. Here's my pick of the best. All of these are at Very, which has tended to be one of the best places for Switch bundle deals in the UK over the past few years. Some of these are specifically flagged as Black Friday deals, so I expect they will end at midnight. This is another UK Switch OLED Bundle deal that i'd consider. It's not being billed as a Cyber Monday deal, but it's a great price when you consider that it's £10 cheaper than the RRP of the OLED console alone, and you get Super Mario Wonder and 12 months' of Nintendo Switch Online included. Back over in the US, there's little left in terms of deals on consoles, I'm afraid. The best options are the Switch and Switch OLED bundle deals at Nintendo and Amazon. These aren't specifically Cyber Monday deals, but at least you get a game thrown in with the console. At this stage, it's very unlikely that any new deals will appear, so these are likely to be the best options for the rest of Cyber Monday, and even the rest of the year. There will be another window for deals after Christmas, but January sales haven't tended to bring up a lot of Switch discounts. There are still Cyber Monday Switch game deals about. Amazon has a whole bunch of big discounts on Sonic games, including 40% off Sonic X Shadow Generations and 38% off Sonic Mania and Sonic Team Racing. A lot of the games with the biggest discounts are ones from big TV and movie franchises like Star Wars (33% off the Heritage Pack), Sponge Bob (38% off the Patrick Star Game), Jurassic Park (25% off the Collection) and Transformers (38% off Galactic Trials).
