Amazon isn’t only putting its foot down and reaffirming its commitment to returning to working in an office five days a week from January 2025—one of the company’s top execs is even claiming that employees are rejoicing at the mandate. Matt Garman, the CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit, insisted that “nine out of 10” workers he had spoken to are looking forward to the new policy being enforced. And if they’re not? “That’s okay, there are other companies around,” the head of the tech giant’s cloud computing business said in an internal call that’s been reviewed by Reuters. Research suggests that many employees may do exactly that. Garman may be in for a shock: Despite his assessment that most workers are raring to return to their desks, reams of research suggest that many will be disgruntled and take up his offer to quit. Already, 67% of U.S. employers have lost talent to competitors offering remote or hybrid work options in the past six months, according to a new report from Remote. Globally, over 73% of employers across 10 countries, including the U.K., Germany and Japan, have faced a similar dilemma after calling time on remote work. After all, they’re competing with the 70% of firms that have said they’re embracing—and even broadening—their remote policies. The same percentage of businesses have said that they’ve accepted hybrid working as the new norm. You can already see this in action at Amazon: A handful of employees anonymously told Fortune that they had already contacted recruiters and interviewed for more flexible jobs just 48 hours after the tech giant announced it’s toughened stance on working from home. “Honestly, I’ve lost so much trust in Amazon leadership at this point,” an exasperated working mom complained. “I’ve been updating my resume and portfolio, and rage applying to new jobs on LinkedIn.” She’s not alone: The anonymous job review site Blind polled 2,585 verified Amazon professionals one day after its CEO Andy Jassy sent out the RTO memo and 73% admitted they are considering quitting in response. Over a third said that they knew someone at the company who had already handed in their resignation because of the announcement. Amazon declined to comment on how it’s readying itself for a potential exodus of staff—or whether that’s what the $1.94 trillion tech giant secrently really wants. While Jassy positioned Amazon’s changes—which also include a flattened hierarchy and no more hot desking—as a better, more collaborative way to work, some employees are adamant that it’s a thinly veiled headcount reduction. After all, research recently found that a quarter of C-suite executives secretly hoped for some voluntary turnover among workers after implementing an RTO policy. “It’s a rob Peter to pay Paul situation of short-term gains from voluntary layoffs in exchange for losing top talent and reducing productivity for years to come,” a Gen X program manager told Fortune. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Falling Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE:MUR) stands against other best falling stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Analysts at Goldman Sachs on October 21st released a note forecasting that the S&P 500 average annual return of 13% for the past 10 years might come down to just 3% for the next decade. The estimates by Goldman Sachs are far below Wall Street’s estimates as analysts on Wall Street expect the index performance to range from 4.4% to 7.4%, with an average of 6%. Analysts at Goldman Sachs based their forecast on the concern that market concentration within the S&P 500 has been at a record high in its 100-year history. They mentioned that the top 10 largest stocks of the index currently account for more than 36% of the overall index. These top 10 constituents of the index have increased in size due to exceptional earnings growth over the past 2 years. The Magnificent Seven alone have at least doubled their earnings year-over-year during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. However, analysts at the firm believe that historical evidence shows it is extremely challenging for companies to sustain high levels of sales growth and profit margins for more than a decade. They also noted that the sales growth of the Magnificent Seven has already started to fall from the accelerated pace of their growth during the past 2 years. On the bright side, analysts pointed out that growth is expected to pick up for the remaining stocks on the index. They expect double-digit earnings growth for these remaining 493 stocks over the next 5 quarters.

Sylvia Jablonski, Defiance ETFs CEO and CIO joined CNBC on October 22 for an interview to talk about the earnings season progress and also shared her point of view regarding the recent note from Goldman Sachs. She noted that we have seen around 14% of the S&P 500 that have reported their earnings and, out of those, 79% beat expectations. She thinks this is a solid start to the earnings season. Jablonski also mentioned that the bar for some of the companies has also come down, for instance in July analysts were talking about 6% to 7% year-over-year growth, and now we are looking at around 5% growth and companies have been achieving it for the most part. While talking about Goldman Sachs’s recent note, she mentioned that the shrink in annual return by the index depends on a few factors. While the valuations are high, the earnings are strong and profits are also growing, thereby the high valuations have started to feel justified. However, it only remains justified until the valuations become lofty again. Jablonski pointed out that while the Magnificent Seven stocks have been the top performers of the last decade, we are going to see a broadening of the market where the performance would come from the remaining stocks in the index. She thinks that this transition of growth from the top constituents of the index to smaller stocks might affect the annual returns. However, AI is going to drive the index for the next 5 to 10 years. Jablonski mentioned utility facilities and energy sector companies having grown in triple digits due to artificial intelligence. Lastly, Jablonski clarified that she is not bearing on tech or semiconductors but the leaders in the S&P 500 are expected to change with Magnificent Seven slowing down in terms of the stellar growth they have posted in the past. Our Methodology To curate the list of the 10 best falling stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and Yahoo Finance. We defined falling stocks as those trading within 0% to 3% of their 52-week lows. Using the Finviz stock screener, we got an aggregated list of stocks that fit our criteria. Next, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge funds holding each stock during Q2 2024, as per Insider Monkey’s database. All indicators were recorded on October 21st, 2024. Please note that the list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A large oil tanker being filled up in a refinery, a symbol of the company's vast energy production. 52 Week Range: $32.53 – $49.14 Current Share Price: $32.96 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37 Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE:MUR) ranks as the 8th best-falling stock to buy according to hedge funds. It is trading close to its 52-week low, however, 37 hedge funds held stakes in the stock in Q2 2024, as per Insider Monkey’s database, indicating bullish sentiment. The company operates as an independent oil and gas-producing company in the United States and Canada. The company searches for new oil and gas-rich areas at onshore and offshore locations to extract and sell energy resources. Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE:MUR), has been actively managing its financial strategies and operational projects in recent quarters. Management has remained focused on achieving Murphy 3.0, which is a strategic initiative aimed at enhancing shareholder returns while maintaining a focus on reducing long-term debt. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the company repurchased $50 million of its senior notes as a move to bring its long-term debt to $1 billion. It also repurchased 56 million shares in the second quarter and an additional 44 million shares by early August, indicating its efforts regarding Murphy 3.0. In terms of production, the company produced an average of 181,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with oil making up 50% of that volume, exceeding their guidance. The second quarter revenue came in at $746 million with a net income of $128 million. Looking ahead, management plans on returning 50% of its adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and utilizing the rest 50% for improving its balance sheet to reduce debt. Overall, MUR ranks 8th on our list of best falling stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of MUR to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Roku Stock's Recent 50% Rally To Continue?

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 18: Charlie Collier, Chelsea Peretti and Amy Poehler seen at Los ... [+] Angeles Friends and Family Screening of Roku's "First Time Female Director" at Vidiots Foundation - Eagle Theatre on March 18, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Eric Charbonneau/Getty Images for Roku) Roku has fared well over the last few months, rising by about 50% since early August. This compares with streaming titan Netflix, which has seen its stock rise close to 29% over the same period. Now Roku is poised to report its Q3 2024 results later this month and we do expect things to get a bit better for the company. We expect revenue to come in at about $1.03 billion for the quarter, up about 13% compared to last year, while net losses are expected to narrow to about $0.30 per share beating estimates. See our analysis of Roku Earnings Preview for some of the trends that are likely to drive Roku’s results for the third quarter. Roku’s operational and financial performance has been improving. Over Q2, Roku’s revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $968 million while operating losses were reduced to $71 million. Key metrics such as streaming hours (up 20%) and total platform accounts (up 14%) also strengthened, while device sales jumped 39%, helping to increase Roku’s installed base. The Roku Channel, the company’s proprietary streaming offering, has also gained in terms of engagement, with streaming hours up nearly 75% year-over-year with the offering emerging as one of the most popular free, ad-supported streaming offerings in the U.S. This is expected to drive higher-margin advertising revenue in the long run. That said, Roku’s per-user revenue growth for its platform business has been easing due to increased sales from international markets. Heightened competition in the advertising markets could also be hurting the company. ARPU stood at $40.68 for the last quarter, roughly flat compared to last year. We will be closely tracking Roku’s cost management and cash flows for the quarter, following the company’s strong recent progress. In Q2 the company saw total operating expenses fall by 2% year-over-year, driven by workforce and office space reductions in 2023. Free cash flow stood at $318 million for Q2, up from negative levels in the year-ago quarter. See a scenario on how Roku stock can hit $200 The decrease in ROKU stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were -31% in 2021, -82% in 2022, and 125% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could ROKU face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery? Roku stock trades at just a little over 2.5x estimated 2024 revenue, which is well below the double-digit multiples the stock traded at in 2021. That said, Roku faces challenges, too. Roku’s streaming service distribution business, which facilitates the subscription process for streaming services and earns commissions for the same, is seeing some headwinds as more streaming services, including Netflix, focus on selling more affordable, ad-supported plans as customers look for better value in a mixed economic environment. Moreover, Roku has to increasingly compete for advertising-related revenue with big technology players including Netflix, Meta, and Alphabet in the video market. We value Roku stock at about $67, which 13% below the current market price. We will be revisiting our price estimate for the stock post Q3 earnings.

Title: Europe’s Electric Vehicle Woes Are a Lesson for EVs Everywhere

Time Published: 2024-10-24T10:00:00Z

Electric cars got top billing at this year’s Paris Auto Show. At the world’s largest such showcase, a central exhibition hall featured an “electric factory” display designed, in the colors of the French flag, to mimic the spine-like assembly lines that churn out electric cars and internal combustion engines. Along the exteriors of those lines were a series of questions answered inside them, where clumps of teens on school trips and car enthusiasts stood by ready to hear the answers: Are electric vehicles produced in France? What new professions are created by electric vehicle production? Just outside the exhibition grounds, autoworkers who spend their days in real-world auto factories had a question of their own: Why are so many of them losing their jobs? A few hundred trade unionists from France, Italy, the United States, and elsewhere gathered in the rain to rail against Stellantis chief Carlos Tavares, the embattled CEO whose global auto group is fending off accusations of mismanagement from workers and investors alike. Late last month, Stellantis issued a profit warning amid lower than expected sales “across most regions.” The company has temporarily suspended production of its fully electric Fiat 500e, citing low sales as it temporarily lays off workers in Italy; Stellantis plans to start producing a hybrid version of the car in 2025 or 2026. Similarly, in the United States, the company has blamed “market conditions” to backtrack on a pledge—enshrined in its contract with the UAW—to reopen and expand an idled plant in Belvidere, Illinois, to include a $3.2 billion battery plant. Stellantis recently announced too that it will expand production of its bestselling, gas-powered Dodge RAM pickups in Mexico. Starting on October 12, it began laying off approximately 1,100 workers from its Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan after ending production of the RAM 1500 Classic pickup there. On October 18, Stellantis workers in Italy carried out a 24-hour nationwide strike, culminating in a rally that brought an estimated 20,000 people out to Rome’s Piazza del Popolo. UAW members recently authorized their own strike against Stellantis, and are in tense negotiations with the company over unrealized investment commitments. The company has filed nine federal lawsuits against the UAW and two dozen locals disputing the union’s contract-violation claims and right to strike over them, arguing the pledge was always “contingent upon plant performance, changes in market conditions and consumer demand.” Amid all this, Tavares has tried to paint himself as a stalwart defender of electrification, ready to weather the winds of change even if that proves difficult in the near term. Speaking to the Financial Times at the Paris Auto Show, he warned that slowing the transition to electric vehicles would be “a big trap” and blamed governments for failing to provide adequate incentives to make the switch. Unions on either side of the Atlantic, however, argue that they’re paying the price for Stellantis’s longtime, short-term focus on maximizing profits and executive pay. “Stellantis has underinvested in this,” i.e., the electric transition, says Maurizio Oreggia, international coordinator for the Italian metalworkers’ union FIOM. He agrees that the Italian government and European Union aren’t doing enough to offer public support for electrification, bolstering which is among FIOM’s top demands. But he also sees Stellantis’s own choices as a key reason why the automaker is falling behind. “This transition is necessary given climate change, if you look at the situation of the planet. But we’ve known we have to do this for many years,” he adds. Instead of reinvesting profits into research and development, improving working conditions, or electrification, “they have distributed profits to shareholders, never to the workers.” Earlier this month, Stellantis announced that it had bought $1.1 billion worth of stock back from shareholders since August. Tavares received a 56 percent pay bump last year. Defending his lavish compensation package in April, Tavares said it was simply part of the contract between himself and the company, “just as there are contracts for soccer players and for Formula 1 drivers.” The situation facing autoworkers is especially acute in Italy, where anger at Stellantis is pitched. Stellantis was created in 2021 through the merger of the French auto group Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler Automotives. Fiat has long been Italy’s only mass-market automaker, responsible for the bulk of the roughly 1.5 million cars made there as recently as the early 2000s. This year, Italy is expected to produce fewer than 500,000 cars, half as many as it made in 2018 and 250,000 fewer than it made last year. That decline has been especially hard-felt in the northern city of Turin—the longtime home of “Mamma Fiat”—which has seen four car plants close since 1982. “The trend is downward in all European countries, but in Italy it’s been particularly strong. Various governments never allowed a foreign player to enter the Italian domestic market for car production,” says economist Simone Gasperin. In addition to heavily subsidizing auto plant construction, Italy historically used state-owned enterprises to support its car industry. That included efforts to build out the country’s highway system and offer cheaper gasoline prices via Eni. Through Alfa Romeo, Gasperine explains that the Italian government “was able to inject a dose of competition, which made Fiat more sensitive to things like investing to remain competitive. It was a way to reduce their monopolistic power.” Fiat acquired Alfa Romeo in 1986 amid a wave of privatizations. Since then, successive governments have generally relied on consumer-side subsidies to bolster the auto sector. And whereas the Inflation Reduction Act’s consumer-side E.V. incentives require that cars and their components be made in the U.S. or its trade partners in order to qualify, EU law generally prohibits these kinds of domestic content requirements. Even the comparatively generous state support for automakers to go electric in the United States can’t make up for their decades spent doubling down on internal combustion engines. Companies have reliably resisted regulatory efforts—like more stringent fuel efficiency standards—that might have spurred innovation. “Stellantis was one of the slowest, if not the slowest, to begin their transition to the next generation of vehicles,” says UAW Region 4 Director Brandon Campbell, who joined the demonstration in Paris and the strike rally in Rome; he first came to the union when he started working at the Belvidere plant in 1994. “They’re paying the price for that, but that is driven by their poor management and their poor decisions.” (For the sake of disclosure, my partner works for the UAW.) The EU has moved to end the sale of internal combustion engine–powered vehicles by 2035, a decision now facing fierce pushback from powerful parties within the bloc. While such a policy certainly spurs demand for E.V.s, it’s not at all clear that European companies will be making them. “Europe has already a much more developed E.V. market than the U.S. but is not prepared to produce most of the E.V.s that will be sold here,” Gasperin tells me. As Chinese companies roll out affordable E.V.s at home and abroad, Stellantis and other European automakers have felt pressured to lower prices in order to compete with foreign companies and convince consumers to buy the still relatively limited range of electric models they’re producing. Larger and more expensive cars make for bigger margins, though. In the U.S., where there’s no looming phaseout deadline for gas-powered cars, automakers including Stellantis have seemed content to double down on mostly gas-powered bestsellers like the RAM and Ford F-Series—however limited the demand for those hulking, pricey trucks and SUVs might be elsewhere. “Manufacturers’ only strategy is to preserve their margins,” Sophie Binet, secretary-general of France’s powerful General Confederation of Labour, or CGT, told those gathered outside the Paris Auto Show last week. “Given our salaries, no worker can afford a car that costs 40, 50, 60, or 100,000 euros.” As the factories making those cars close and companies move production abroad, she quipped that “the CGT project is simple: a small economical electric vehicle entirely manufactured in France, which could be sold for around 15,000 euros.” Kate Aronoff is a staff writer at The New Republic.

Sorry! Your browser is not supported. To view this site you can download a newer version of Internet Explorer. Share this The 90-tonne Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) machine has been custom-designed and built for Rocket Lab and is expected to save around 150,000 manufacturing hours in the Neutron rocket’s production process. Long Beach, California. August 8, 2024. – Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has begun installation of the largest automated fiber placement (AFP) machine of its kind into the Company’s Neutron rocket production line in Middle River, MD. The AFP machine will enable Rocket Lab to automate production of the largest carbon composite rocket structures in history. The custom-built 99 ton (90 tonne), 39 ft tall (12-meter) robotic machine, American-made by Electroimpact in Washington, has just completed final acceptance testing with the manufacturer and installation has begun at Rocket Lab’s Space Structures Complex in Middle River, Maryland. The new machine will automate the production of all large composite structures of the Neutron launch vehicle including the panels that make up the 91 ft (28 meter) length interstage and fairing, 22.9 ft (7 meter) diameter first stage, and the 16.4 ft (5 meter) diameter second stage tank. The autonomous machine can move up to 98 ft (30 meters) in length and lay down continuous carbon fiber composite at a rate of 328 ft (100 meters) per minute. The AFP machine also has a fully automated real-time inspection system that hunts for miniscule defects throughout the laminated carbon composite and alerts the machine operator of any issues before the machine begins laying down the next layer, providing additional assurance that these critical structures of the launch vehicle meet Rocket Lab’s high-quality standards required for reusable Neutron launches. As Neutron’s carbon composite structures move into full-scale production, this autonomous machine is expected to introduce significant time-savings of 150,000+ manufacturing hours into the production process. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “As we build the world’s largest carbon composite rocket, it makes sense that we require a world-first carbon composite fiber placement machine. We’re combining our proprietary flight-proven carbon composite technology, additive manufacturing, and autonomous robotics to design and build large-scale aerospace components at a pace that will support not only Neutron’s launch cadence, but support Electron and carbon composites structures for our spacecraft customers too. We worked closely with our excellent partners at Electroimpact to create this robot and we’re thrilled with the results. It’s an innovative machine producing a next-generation rocket from one of the birthplaces of the aerospace industry in Baltimore, and we can’t wait to see its first carbon composite printed panels come off the production line soon.” The AFP machine will also be leveraged to print smaller carbon composite Neutron structures, first stages of Rocket Lab’s Electron launch vehicle, and other flight-proven carbon composite structures for space including spacecraft structural panels and assemblies, solar panel substrates, carbon composite tanks and primary structures, and custom projects for the aerospace industry. ENDS About Neutron Neutron is the new medium-lift reusable launch vehicle by Rocket Lab. Capable of carrying up to 13,000 kg to low Earth orbit, Neutron is designed to deliver constellations of satellites to space at once, important national security missions, and human exploration beyond Earth’s orbit. Neutron will be the world’s first medium-lift carbon composite rocket, building off of Rocket Lab’s proprietary and flight-proven techniques utilized across 50+ launches of its Electron carbon composite small orbital launch vehicle. Powering Neutron is Rocket Lab’s new 3D printed reusable rocket engine Archimedes, an oxygen-rich staged combustion engine using liquid oxygen and methane propellants that is designed for rapid reusability, deep throttle ability for multiple engine burns in space, and for propulsive landings when returning to the launch site. Neutron will launch and land at its own dedicated launch and test range within Rocket Lab Launch Complex 3 at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island, Virginia, starting in 2025.

Thursday, 24 Oct 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: Take your squabbles outside the House, warns Deputy Dewan Rakyat Speaker Alice Lau after a war of words erupted during the afternoon debates. This comes after Datuk Dr Radzi Jidin (PN-Putrajaya) challenged Howard Lee (PH-Ipoh Timor) to a debate over the sale of Malaysia Airport Holdings Berhad (MAHB) shares to BlackRock Inc. A visibly frustrated Lau then switched off their microphones and sternly ordered them to take things outside. ALSO READ: No foreign ownership, govt to retain full control of MAHB, says Finance Ministry “If any of you want to challenge each other (to debates), do it outside. Not here,” warned Lau on Thursday (Oct 24). When debating the Supply Bill 2025 earlier on Thursday, Radzi claimed MAHB was being “sold to BlackRock”. Lee interjected saying that Radzi’s statement was misleading. Radzi then said 30% of MAHB shares were being sold, with Lee arguing this meant 70% is still owned by Malaysia with the matter erupting into a shouting match. Earlier this year, it was reported that GIP planned to buy a 30% stake in MAHB’s privatisation move. GIP has since been acquired by BlackRock, a firm that is reported to have investments in Israel. The deal has been heavily criticised by opposition politicians as Malaysia strongly supports Palestine.

Title: BlackRock goes on Bitcoin buying spree when others flee

Share this article BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) keeps attracting investor interest, ending Wednesday with over $317 million in net inflows while most competing ETFs struggle to maintain their winning streak. Trailing behind IBIT, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust, the BTC fund, reported gains of nearly $5 million yesterday, according to Farside Investors data. In contrast, ARK Invest’s ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL, suffered a combined loss of nearly $130 million. With IBIT’s massive inflows and additional capital from BTC, the group of US spot Bitcoin ETFs reversed a negative trend yesterday, collectively drawing in around $192 million. These funds have shown mixed trends this week, unlike last week when there was no net bleeding reported. Flows turned negative on Tuesday after $294 million in gains on Monday. The ARKB fund, which enjoyed over $300 million in inflows last week, has been hit hard. The ETF has seen nearly $240 million in redemptions so far this week, almost wiping its gains from the previous week. Meanwhile, it seems that GBTC’s outflows have subsided; the fund saw only about $5 million in losses on Monday. The latest performance coincides with Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. After peaking at $69,500 last week, Bitcoin has pulled back, now hovering around the $67,000 level, per CoinGecko. Standard Chartered analysts are confident that the largest crypto will revisit its previous record high before the next president is selected, thereby boosting the chances of “Uptober.” However, recent declines may dampen the “Uptober” outlook, especially with the US presidential election just around the corner. Bitcoin may face a “sell-the-news” scenario ahead of the key event. As the election approaches, investors often speculate on how the results might impact various asset classes, including crypto. This anticipation can lead to increased volatility, with traders potentially selling off assets to lock in profits before election results are announced. Bitcoin’s recent price fluctuations are more likely influenced by broader macroeconomic trends rather than direct political events. However, any significant news related to the election could trigger reactions from investors looking to adjust their portfolios based on perceived risks or opportunities. Some analysts predict that a Trump victory could lead to a surge in Bitcoin prices due to his pro-crypto stance. As soon as the election is over, the market is likely to take little rest as the next FOMC meeting occurs, when the Fed makes its interest rate decision. The central bank is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points as part of its ongoing monetary policy adjustments, which analysts suggest could further boost Bitcoin’s prices.

Title: India Bond ETFs To Draw Billions as Amundi to BlackRock Join Race

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Some of the world’s biggest exchange-traded fund providers are battling it out for the billions of dollars expected to flow into Indian bonds in coming years through their inclusion in key global indexes. Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion Oman Sees an Urban Future Distinct From Dubai and Abu Dhabi Transportation Policy Gets Left Behind in Presidential Race How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain Booming Cambridge Exposes England’s Widening Wealth Gap BlackRock Inc., Amundi SA and Janus Henderson’s Tabula Investment Management unit are among those that have launched new ETFs on the sector since JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s decision to include Indian debt in its key emerging-market index last year. Such ETFs are set to attract $5 billion to $10 billion over the medium term, according to estimates by asset management firm DWS Group. “India is too big to ignore,” said Benoit Sorel, global head of ETF, indexing and smart beta at Amundi, the largest European ETF provider. “It’s becoming a key allocation within emerging-market debt. The first key interests are coming from professional investors, who are benchmarking their allocation.” Sorel, who worked for over a decade at BlackRock before joining Amundi last year, helped oversee the rollout of the company’s new Indian government bond ETF last month. India’s weighting in JPMorgan’s emerging-markets bond index will jump to 10% by March from the current level of 4%. The securities are also set to be added to developing-nation debt gauges owned by FTSE Russell and Bloomberg. That process is poised to bring billions into the largely domestic-led market, that has so far been largely insulated from global gyrations due to low overseas ownership. Rupee-denominated government bonds are currently the highest yielding in Asia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on the largest regional markets. Indian bonds have attracted $15.4 billion of inflows this year, the most in Asia behind China, South Korea and Japan, data compiled by Bloomberg show. ‘Compelling’ Case DWS sees plenty of scope for Indian assets to rise due to the country’s demographic makeup and their relatively low correlation with other global markets. “The strength of its equity market, the youth and level of education of its workforce, but also its lower exposure to geopolitical risks make the case of India compelling to both equity and fixed-income investors,” said Olivier Souliac, head of Xtrackers indexing at DWS in Frankfurt. “The strength of a passive product will, according to us, lie in its convenience,” he said. Not everyone is convinced this is an ideal time to buy Indian debt. “It’s too crowded,” said Shamaila Khan, head of fixed-income emerging markets & Asia Pacific at UBS Asset Management in New York. “India’s a positive story in the medium term, but right now there’s just too much good news priced in.” Dollar bonds from Sri Lanka and Pakistan, along with Chinese high yield debt look to be better bets, she said. PineBridge Investments said this month it’s avoiding Indian sovereign bonds due to the bureaucratic challenges of investing in the country and the company’s preference for the higher carry offered in Latin America. BlackRock says one of the advantages of buying Indian bond ETFs is that they will help investors sidestep any bureaucratic obstacles of investing in the country. “There are structural challenges for foreign investors to get their hands on any of these bonds easily,” said Hui Sien Koay, lead fixed-income-product strategist for Asia Pacific at BlackRock in Singapore. “The ETF gets rid of all those. ETFs are so accessible to everyone.” There are a number of reasons why investors won’t be able to overlook India for long, she said “It’s the last large market of over $1 trillion to enter widely followed indexes. It’s got the depth, it’s got the breadth, it’s got the different tenors, long and short, and that’s why we’re in the game.” (Updates inflows in sixth pagragraph, adds additional comment from analyst in ninth.

Title: Elevance Health's SWOT analysis: stock faces medicaid headwinds, growth potential
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/elevance-healths-swot-analysis-stock-faces-medicaid-headwinds-growth-potential-93CH-3679373
Time Published: 2024-10-24T06:26:07Z
Full Content:
Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV), a leading healthcare company offering a range of insurance and healthcare services, has recently faced challenges in its Medicaid business while maintaining growth potential in other segments. This comprehensive analysis examines the company's current position, recent financial performance, and future prospects in light of industry trends and competitive pressures. Elevance Health operates through various segments, including Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, and Other segments. The company has recently expanded its footprint through strategic acquisitions, including Paragon Healthcare, BioPlus Specialty Pharmacy, and Kroger (NYSE:KR) Specialty Pharmacy. These acquisitions have bolstered Elevance Health's position in the specialty pharmacy sector, a move that analysts view as potentially driving future growth. Elevance Health's recent financial performance has been marked by challenges, particularly in its Medicaid business. The company has lowered its earnings per share (EPS) guidance for 2024 and now expects mid-single-digit EPS growth in 2025, a significant decrease from its previous long-term growth target of over 12%. This adjustment has led to a decline in the company's share price and prompted analysts to revise their projections. Despite these challenges, some analysts maintain a positive outlook on Elevance Health's long-term prospects. The company's core commercial business remains strong, and there is potential for expansion in this segment. Additionally, Elevance Health's Carelon division is seen as having robust growth potential, which could help offset some of the pressures in other areas of the business. The primary source of Elevance Health's recent challenges lies in its Medicaid business. The company has experienced increased utilization in outpatient services, particularly in radiology and medical equipment. This trend, coupled with a timing mismatch between rates and acuity, has put pressure on Medicaid margins. Analysts expect these Medicaid-related headwinds to be temporary, with some projecting that margins will normalize by 2027. However, the near-term impact on earnings is significant, with new EPS guidance for 2024 set at $33, down by $4.20 from previous estimates. Elevance Health's management has indicated that they do not anticipate an acceleration of current Medicaid cost trends but expect them to sustain. The company's ability to manage these challenges and secure appropriate rate adjustments will be crucial for its performance in the coming years. While Medicaid has been a source of concern, Elevance Health's Medicare and commercial businesses have shown more stability. Medicare trends are reported to be in line with expectations, although there are some concerns about potential margin pressure in 2025 due to richer flex card benefits and the impact of the two-midnight rule on inpatient costs. The commercial business has demonstrated consistent trends with previous quarters, providing a steady foundation for the company. However, analysts note potential risks, including commercial risk spread compression and shifts in commercial risk from Administrative Services Only (ASO) arrangements. Elevance Health's Carelon division represents a significant opportunity for growth. The company is expected to drive upside through specialty sales in Blues networks, leveraging its recent acquisitions in the specialty pharmacy sector. Analysts view this expansion positively, seeing it as a key driver of future earnings growth and a potential offset to challenges in other segments. The managed care industry is facing several challenges and changes that impact Elevance Health and its competitors. Recent analysis of Medicare Advantage plans for 2025 indicates broad-based benefit cuts across the industry, which could affect customer satisfaction and retention. Elevance Health has made relatively modest cuts to its health plan benefits for 2025 compared to its peers, potentially positioning it favorably in terms of customer attraction and retention. However, elevated concerns about Stars ratings pose risks to companies' reputations and could potentially affect enrollment numbers. Additionally, the industry faces scrutiny, with a potential House investigation into PBM industry concentration adding regulatory uncertainty. Elevance Health's Medicaid business is currently facing significant headwinds due to increased utilization in outpatient services and a mismatch between rates and acuity. These challenges have already led to a reduction in EPS guidance for 2024 and lower growth expectations for 2025. If these issues persist longer than anticipated or if the company is unable to secure appropriate rate adjustments, it could result in prolonged margin pressure in the Medicaid segment. The company's profitability could be further impacted if state budgets tighten, leading to more aggressive rate negotiations or benefit reductions. Additionally, if the normalization of Medicaid margins takes longer than the projected timeline of 2027, it could lead to a sustained period of underperformance in this segment, potentially dragging down overall company profitability. While Elevance Health's Medicare business has been relatively stable, there are emerging risks that could impact its performance. One significant concern is the potential for margin pressure in 2025 due to richer flex card benefits. If competitors offer more attractive benefits, Elevance Health may need to follow suit to maintain market share, which could erode profitability. Another risk factor is the impact of the two-midnight rule on inpatient costs. If these costs continue to rise without corresponding reimbursement increases, it could squeeze Medicare margins. Additionally, there are concerns about potential adverse selection due to deep benefit cuts by competitors. If Elevance Health maintains more generous benefits while others cut back, it may attract higher-risk beneficiaries, potentially leading to increased medical costs and lower profitability in the Medicare segment. Elevance Health's diversified business model, encompassing commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, and specialty services, provides the company with multiple avenues for growth and recovery. While the Medicaid segment is currently facing challenges, the company's strong core commercial business and stable Medicare operations offer a solid foundation for overall performance. The Carelon division, in particular, represents a significant growth opportunity. With recent acquisitions in the specialty pharmacy sector, Elevance Health is well-positioned to expand its presence in this high-growth area. The potential for increased specialty sales through Blues networks could drive substantial revenue growth, helping to offset temporary setbacks in other segments. Furthermore, the company's diversification allows it to balance risks across different market segments. As Medicaid challenges are addressed and margins potentially normalize by 2027, growth in other areas of the business could help Elevance Health return to its long-term growth trajectory. Elevance Health's recent acquisitions of Paragon Healthcare, BioPlus Specialty Pharmacy, and Kroger Specialty Pharmacy have significantly bolstered its position in the specialty pharmacy sector. This strategic expansion presents several growth opportunities for the company. Firstly, the specialty pharmacy market is experiencing rapid growth due to the increasing prevalence of chronic and complex diseases requiring specialized medications. By strengthening its presence in this sector, Elevance Health can tap into this growing market, potentially driving significant revenue increases. Secondly, the integration of these specialty pharmacies with Elevance Health's existing health plans and provider networks could create synergies that improve patient care and reduce overall healthcare costs. This integrated approach could make Elevance Health more attractive to both individual consumers and employer groups seeking comprehensive healthcare solutions. Lastly, the expansion into specialty pharmacy aligns well with the company's Carelon division, which is already seen as a strong growth driver. The combination of Carelon's existing capabilities with the newly acquired specialty pharmacy assets could create a powerful platform for innovation in medication management and care coordination, potentially setting Elevance Health apart from its competitors in the managed care industry.

October 24, 2024 02:00 ET | Source: Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan PLC (the “Company”) LEI: 213800SZZD4E21OZ9W55 Portfolio Update: Alliance Witan completes portfolio transition, brings in EdgePoint for Black Creek Alliance Witan’s investment manager, Willis Towers Watson (“WTW”), is pleased to announce the completion of the transition of assets from Witan Investment Trust (“Witan”) to Alliance Witan following shareholder approval for the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan on 9 October. Blackrock Inc. has helped to manage the transition and keep the costs to a minimum. While Blackrock was completing the transition of assets, WTW took the opportunity to also make a manager change, replacing Black Creek Investment Management (“Black Creek”) with EdgePoint Wealth Management (“EdgePoint”). The appointment of EdgePoint follows that of Jennison Associates, previously one of Witan’s investment managers, which was announced at the start of the transition just over two weeks ago. EdgePoint, based in Toronto, is an employee-owned business, founded in 2008. It manages $25bn of client assets, as of 30 June 2024, and seeks to buy good, undervalued business and hold them until the market fully realises their potential. With the portfolio realignment now completed, the new manager allocations are as follows: The resulting risk profile of the portfolio is largely unchanged, with no excessive exposure relative to the benchmark to regions, sectors or styles, and most of the added value is expected to come from stock selection. The direct costs of the portfolio transition and manager changes, including BlackRock’s fee, trading commissions, tax and bid/offer spreads, will be less than 0.04% of the Alliance Witan portfolio, representing fair value for shareholders. Craig Baker, Chief Investment Officer of WTW and Chair of the Alliance Witan Investment Committee, said: “We would like to express our appreciation to the team at Black Creek for their contribution to the Company since their appointment in 2017. While we continue to rate Black Creek highly, a senior member of the team left in the last 12 months on health grounds, and we have been evaluating succession planning for some time. While Bill Kanko has no specific retirement date in mind and there are other experienced investors at the firm, we have taken the opportunity to switch to a manager in which we have high conviction, and which brings a fresh perspective to the new, combined portfolio. Baker added: “Now that Witan’s assets are fully invested, it is business as usual. We will be using the same proven investment approach we have always used for Alliance Witan, although we will be retaining a small number of Witan’s discounted investment trust holdings, which represent less than 3% of the portfolio, until such time that they can be sold at an attractive price for shareholders.” Ends About Alliance Witan (ALW) Alliance Witan aims to deliver long-term capital growth and rising income from investing in global equities at a competitive cost.

Title: Ford's SWOT analysis: stock outlook amid EV transition and cost challenges
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/fords-swot-analysis-stock-outlook-amid-ev-transition-and-cost-challenges-93CH-3679340

Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), a global leader in the automotive industry, is navigating a complex landscape of challenges and opportunities as it transitions towards electric vehicles (EVs) and digital services. This comprehensive analysis examines Ford's current position, future prospects, and the factors influencing its stock performance. Ford, trading under the ticker NYSE:F, has a long-standing presence in the global automotive market. The company manufactures and distributes vehicles across six continents, with a product lineup that includes cars, trucks, and utility vehicles under the Ford and Lincoln brands. In recent years, Ford has been intensifying its focus on electric vehicles and connected services, aiming to position itself as a leader in the evolving automotive industry. Ford's financial performance has been a mixed bag in recent quarters. The company's second-quarter earnings for 2024 fell short of elevated expectations, disappointing some stakeholders. Despite this setback, Ford maintained its guidance for the fiscal year 2024, projecting adjusted EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) in the range of $10 to $12 billion. Analysts are divided on Ford's near-term prospects. Some believe the company may reach the upper end of its guidance range, citing potential strengths in the Pro segment, cost improvements, and reduced losses from the Model e division. Others express concern about the impact of price normalization and the possibility of a slowdown in the latter half of 2024. The company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are expected to grow from $2.01 in FY23 to $2.20 in FY25, indicating a positive trajectory despite near-term challenges. Ford's electric vehicle strategy is a critical component of its future growth plans. The company is committed to expanding its EV lineup, leveraging iconic nameplates and its strong position in commercial vehicles. The introduction of Gen-2 EV platforms is anticipated to be a potential game-changer, with analysts suggesting it could transition Ford's EV segment from losses to profits. However, the EV transition is not without challenges. Recent data shows that Ford's EV sales have not demonstrated significant quarter-over-quarter growth, raising questions about the pace of adoption and market demand. The company's "Skunkworks" platform is seen as potentially transformative, but it remains a "show-me story," indicating that its success is yet to be proven. Cost management has been a persistent challenge for Ford. Warranty costs, in particular, have been a significant drag on profitability, highlighting ongoing quality issues that need to be addressed. The company has acknowledged these challenges and is reportedly undergoing a cultural change to improve cost control and operational efficiency. Ford's restructuring efforts, especially in overseas markets, have shown positive results. However, cost structures in the United States remain high, presenting an ongoing area for improvement. Ford faces intense competition in the automotive industry, particularly as the sector shifts towards electrification and digital services. The company's Pro segment, which focuses on commercial vehicles, has shown strength and is expected to benefit from software and service offerings. This segment could be a key differentiator for Ford in the competitive landscape. Investor sentiment has shown a preference for General Motors (NYSE:GM) over Ford, primarily due to differences in capital return profiles. This preference underscores the importance of Ford's efforts to improve its financial performance and shareholder returns. Looking ahead, Ford's future prospects are tied to several key factors. The company's ability to successfully transition to electric vehicles while maintaining profitability in its traditional segments will be crucial. The growing focus on software and services, particularly in connected vehicles, presents an opportunity for Ford to tap into new revenue streams and potentially improve margins. The company's electrification strategy, which leverages iconic nameplates and its strong position in commercial vehicles, could provide a competitive advantage. However, execution risks remain, and the success of Ford's low-cost EV platform will be closely watched by investors and industry observers. Warranty costs have been a significant concern for Ford, negatively impacting its profitability. These costs not only affect the company's bottom line directly but also raise questions about product quality and reliability. If Ford fails to address these issues effectively, it could lead to continued financial strain and potentially damage the brand's reputation. Improving quality control and reducing warranty-related expenses will be crucial for enhancing profitability and maintaining customer trust. Ford's transition to electric vehicles comes with substantial risks. The company is investing heavily in EV technology and production, but market adoption rates remain uncertain. If EV sales growth fails to meet expectations, Ford could face overcapacity issues and lower returns on its investments. Additionally, the competitive landscape in the EV market is intensifying, with both traditional automakers and new entrants vying for market share. Ford must navigate these challenges while also managing the decline of its traditional internal combustion engine business, which still accounts for a significant portion of its revenues and profits. Ford's increasing focus on software and services, particularly in connected vehicles, presents a significant opportunity to boost margins. These digital offerings typically have higher profit margins compared to traditional vehicle sales. By developing a robust ecosystem of software and services, Ford could create new revenue streams that are less cyclical than vehicle sales. This shift could also enhance customer loyalty and provide valuable data insights, allowing Ford to improve its products and services continually. If executed successfully, this strategy could transform Ford's business model and financial profile, potentially leading to higher valuation multiples similar to those seen in tech companies. Ford's Gen-2 EV platform has the potential to significantly improve the company's market position in the electric vehicle segment. This new platform is expected to be more cost-effective and efficient, potentially allowing Ford to offer competitive EVs at lower price points. If successful, it could help Ford capture a larger share of the growing EV market and improve profitability in this segment. The Gen-2 platform could also enable Ford to expand its EV lineup more rapidly, covering a broader range of vehicle types and price points. This flexibility could be crucial in adapting to changing consumer preferences and regulatory requirements, positioning Ford as a strong competitor in the evolving automotive landscape. Strengths: Weaknesses: Opportunities: Threats: This analysis is based on information available up to October 24, 2024, and reflects the complex dynamics shaping Ford's future in a rapidly evolving automotive industry.

Title: DoubleVerify's SWOT analysis: digital ad verification stock faces headwinds

DoubleVerify Holdings , Inc. (NYSE:DV), a leading provider of digital media measurement and analytics software, has been navigating a challenging landscape in recent months. The company, which aims to ensure ad viewability and effectiveness across digital platforms, has seen its stock price decline significantly year-to-date, prompting a closer examination of its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the evolving digital advertising ecosystem. DoubleVerify operates in the digital media space, offering software solutions for online media verification and optimization. The company's core value proposition revolves around providing brand safety, ad fraud protection, and viewability measurement for digital advertisers. In an increasingly complex digital advertising landscape, DoubleVerify's services have become critical for many large advertisers seeking to ensure the effectiveness and integrity of their online campaigns. The company operates in what some analysts describe as a duopoly within the ad verification sector, competing primarily with Integral Ad Science (IAS). This market structure has allowed DoubleVerify to maintain strong margins and a defensible business model. However, the recent exit of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) from the ads business with the closure of its Moat and Grapeshot offerings has created both opportunities and challenges for DoubleVerify. DoubleVerify's recent financial performance has been mixed, reflecting both the company's strong market position and the challenges it faces. In its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue of $156 million, representing a 17% year-over-year increase and slightly exceeding consensus estimates. The company's EBITDA for the quarter was $46.8 million, with a margin of 30%, surpassing the high end of its guidance. However, DoubleVerify has faced headwinds that have impacted its near-term outlook. The company recently reduced its full-year revenue guidance by $27 million, citing issues with some of its largest advertisers. This adjustment has raised concerns among investors and analysts about the company's growth trajectory and customer concentration risks. Looking ahead, DoubleVerify expects growth of approximately 15% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2024. While this represents a deceleration from previous growth rates, the company and some analysts anticipate a potential re-acceleration in the latter half of 2024 and into 2025. DoubleVerify's growth strategy is heavily focused on capitalizing on opportunities in social media and Connected TV (CTV) advertising. The company has seen strong growth in social measurement revenue, which increased by 44% year-over-year in the most recent quarter, driven by short-form video platforms. Additionally, video impressions now account for over 50% of measured impressions, with CTV impressions growing by 55% year-over-year. However, the company faces challenges in fully capitalizing on these opportunities. The anticipated growth from social media and CTV platforms has been progressing slower than initially expected, creating some near-term headwinds for revenue growth. Additionally, DoubleVerify's limited pre-bid solutions for social media advertising have created challenges as advertisers shift more spending to these platforms. Another significant challenge for DoubleVerify is its high customer concentration. The company's recent guidance reduction was primarily attributed to issues with a small number of its top 100 customers. This concentration highlights the potential volatility in DoubleVerify's revenue if key customers reduce spending or switch to competitors. Despite these challenges, DoubleVerify is pursuing several strategic initiatives to drive long-term growth. One of the most significant is its partnership with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). This collaboration represents a substantial opportunity, with over 40 advertisers currently testing DoubleVerify's solutions on Meta's platforms. Analysts estimate that this partnership could potentially generate over $90 million in revenue for DoubleVerify over time. The company is also focusing on expanding its presence in retail media networks, which have been a core driver of supply-side revenue growth. As major retailers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:NYSE:WMT) continue to build out their advertising platforms, DoubleVerify is well-positioned to provide verification and measurement services for these growing ecosystems. DoubleVerify's recent guidance reduction, primarily due to issues with a small number of large customers, highlights the risks associated with its high customer concentration. This dependence on a relatively small group of advertisers for a significant portion of revenue creates vulnerability to spending fluctuations or potential customer losses. If these issues persist or expand to other key accounts, it could lead to further revenue volatility and potentially impact the company's long-term growth trajectory. The slower-than-anticipated ramp-up in social media and CTV advertising presents a significant challenge for DoubleVerify. These areas were expected to be major growth drivers, and the company's limited pre-bid solutions for social platforms have created headwinds as advertisers shift more spending to these channels. If DoubleVerify cannot accelerate its product development and market penetration in these crucial segments, it may struggle to achieve the growth rates necessary to justify its valuation and meet investor expectations. The partnership with Meta Platforms represents a substantial growth opportunity for DoubleVerify. With over 40 advertisers already testing the company's solutions on Meta's platforms and potential revenue estimates exceeding $90 million over time, this collaboration could be a game-changer. Success in this partnership could not only drive significant revenue growth but also enhance DoubleVerify's market position and attract new customers seeking comprehensive verification across major digital platforms. Despite recent challenges, DoubleVerify's long-term growth prospects remain strong. The company operates in a duopoly within the ad verification sector, maintains high margins, and has multiple growth levers. The recent stock price decline has brought valuations to more attractive levels, with the company trading at lower multiples compared to historical averages. If DoubleVerify can successfully navigate near-term headwinds and capitalize on opportunities in social, CTV, and retail media, the current valuation could represent an attractive entry point for long-term investors.

Title: Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Revolutionizing Delivery with Record Speed and Prime Benefits

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 7 Best Delivery Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other best delivery stocks to invest in now. The delivery and courier industry is diverse, encompassing a wide range of services that connect businesses and consumers through various shipping methods. Parcel delivery services are a major component, with companies offering both domestic and international shipping options, driven by the rise of e-commerce. Another significant segment is food delivery platforms. These platforms connect hungry customers with local eateries, creating a new business model that thrives on convenience. Overall, the delivery industry is evolving rapidly, with diverse players working to meet the growing expectations for speed and reliability in shipping services. According to Zion Market Research, the global on-demand delivery market was valued at $15.19 billion in 2023. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.90% during 2024-2032 to reach $83.82 billion by ​the end of the forecast period. In 2023, the Asia-Pacific region led the market in revenue and is projected to maintain its dominance throughout the forecast period. Read Also: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In This growth is fueled by increasing consumer expectations for fast and reliable delivery services, particularly same-day and next-day options. Experts highlight that the demand for quick deliveries has led to substantial investments in last-mile delivery solutions and advanced technologies, such as automation and artificial intelligence (AI). In 2024, consumers have continued to prioritize free and fast shipping for their online orders, according to recent data from Digital Commerce 360 and Bizrate Insights. A survey of 1,013 online shoppers revealed that 81.34% consider free shipping their top priority when receiving deliveries. Fast shipping follows closely, with 68.41% of respondents highlighting its importance. Additionally, 55.68% of consumers emphasized the need for retailers to keep products in stock and ready to ship. AI and automation are key trends that are significantly transforming the delivery services industry, making operations more efficient and responsive to consumer demands. For example, companies like DHL Express have introduced the DHLBot in Singapore and South Korea. The DHLBot is an AI-powered robotics arm that can sort over 1,000 small parcels per hour with 99% accuracy. This technology not only speeds up the sorting process but also reduces labor costs and minimizes errors, allowing for quicker deliveries. As the industry evolves, it is clear that AI and automation will play a crucial role in shaping the future of delivery services. Methodology To compile our list of the 7 best delivery stocks to invest in now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest delivery companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources. From an initial pool of more than 20 delivery stocks, we focused on the top 7 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 912 elite hedge funds. The 7 best delivery stocks to invest in now are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q2 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 308 Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a major American technology company known for its extensive e-commerce platform, which offers a wide variety of products ranging from books to electronics. The company has grown to become the world’s largest online retailer and a leader in cloud computing through its Amazon Web Services (AWS). A key aspect of its business is its delivery services, which include fast shipping options like Amazon Prime, allowing members to receive their orders quickly through same-day delivery, one-day delivery, and two-day delivery service options. The company’s innovative logistics network continues to redefine online shopping and delivery experiences globally. At the end of July, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced a remarkable achievement in its delivery service, reporting that over 5 billion items have already been delivered the same or next day globally this year, marking a 30% increase from the previous year. This record speed not only benefits Prime members by allowing them to receive products faster but also supports small and medium-sized businesses, with many of these deliveries made on behalf of independent sellers using the company’s Fulfillment by Amazon service. Since the launch of Prime in 2005, the selection of items eligible for free Prime shipping has expanded from just one million to over 300 million, with tens of millions available for Same-Day or One-Day Delivery. This means that Prime members now enjoy 20 times more options delivered much quicker than before, enhancing the overall value of their membership. In November 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) surpassed UPS in parcel volume in 2022 and surpassed FedEx in 2020, with expectations that this lead will continue to grow based on internal Amazon data. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is actively enhancing its services to provide even greater value to its Prime members, which makes it an attractive delivery stock to consider. In the first half of 2024, the company achieved record delivery speeds and this rapid delivery is supported by an expanded selection of products, including popular brands like Aéropostale and Kiehl’s. Additionally, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) now offers US Prime members a Grubhub+ membership, valued at $120 a year, and has launched grocery delivery subscriptions that allow unlimited deliveries for a low monthly fee when shopping at the company’s fresh stores in the US and the UK. Moreover, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is leveraging advanced technology, including AI-powered features like the shopping assistant Rufus, to improve customer experience. The company has also expanded its pharmacy services, providing Medicare members access to essential medications for just $5 a month. These strategic initiatives combined with the company’s focus on speed, selection, and added value position Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a strong contender in the delivery market. According to Insider Monkey’s database, AMZN has gained significant interest from institutional investors, with the number of hedge fund holders increasing to 308 in Q2 2024, up from 302 in the previous quarter. Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of best delivery stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of delivery companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Chainlink nears breakout: Is LINK’s surge to $50 coming?

Chainlink nears breakout, boosted by whale activity and expanding real-world asset integration. Chainlink [LINK] neared a potential breakout as it approached a critical point in the market. At press time, LINK was trading within a falling wedge pattern on the weekly timeframe, and many traders anticipated a significant upward movement soon. These developments could push LINK’s price higher as it became an even more vital player in the crypto world. Looking at recent price action, Chainlink has gained around 0.5% over the past week. However, the last 24 hours saw a decline of 5.6%. Despite the short-term losses, LINK’s trading volume surged by over 10%, with approximately $290 million changing hands. The volume-to-market-cap ratio sat at 4%, indicating sufficient liquidity to support continued trading activity. As LINK moves toward a possible breakout, all eyes are on the $15 level. If LINK can break and hold above this resistance, it could trigger a rally that targets $50 by next year. Source: TradingView LINK is currently trading below the 50-day moving average, and flipping this level could reignite bullish momentum. Traders are closely watching for this signal, as it could confirm a breakout from the falling wedge pattern. If the breakout occurs, LINK could see a strong move higher, making it a top contender in the crypto market during the final quarter of the year. Large trades and whale orders are offering further clues about LINK’s future direction. On the K-line chart, large trades appear as circles, with the size representing the trade amount. Whale orders are marked by horizontal lines, with Chainlink’s big orders concentrated around the $11 zone. These trades suggest that large investors are positioning themselves for a move higher, as whales typically accumulate when they expect a price increase. The longer these orders remain unfilled, the more likely it is that they will drive LINK’s price higher. Source: Coinglass Chainlink’s expansion into real-world assets (RWA) and artificial intelligence (AI) is also setting the stage for a significant price boost. Chainlink’s role as a provider of secure oracles for smart contracts positions it perfectly for the upcoming tokenization of RWAs. As major financial players like BlackRock explore tokenizing stocks, bonds, and real estate, Chainlink could become a central infrastructure for these assets. Read Chainlink’s [LINK] Price Prediction 2024–2025 This integration could absorb massive amounts of liquidity into LINK, further driving its price higher. Chainlink is at a pivotal moment. If LINK holds key support levels and breaks above $15, the sky may be the limit.

Title: Is Blue Bird Corporation (BLBD) the Best EV Stock to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best EV Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Blue Bird Corporation (NASDAQ:BLBD) stands against the other EV stocks. After a swift rise in the EV industry over the years, we saw a slowdown in its progress, especially in Europe and the USA. Nevertheless, it is just a matter of time before the technology takes over the traditional internal combustion engines (ICE). While the growth has been slowing in the western part of the world, China has been working tirelessly to become the global leader in the EV industry. In a podcast episode of Everything Electric Show on October 20, Ford CEO Jim Farley discussed the ongoing transformation in the automotive industry. He noted that while EV adoption continues to grow worldwide, significant changes have occurred regarding market dynamics. He emphasized China's dominance in EV production, with 70% of global EVs manufactured there. A rapidly expanding sub-segment in China is electric vehicles with extended range (e-rev), which use a small combustion engine to power the batteries for longer trips. This shift is reshaping global supply chains, brand preferences, and jobs, with geopolitical factors further influencing the industry's future. Farley noted that these changes have become clearer over the past year. We also discussed the country’s dominance in our article about small-cap EV stocks to invest in. Here is an excerpt from the article: “While the growth in the US and Europe is slowing down, China is picking up a significant pace and dominating the EV landscape. According to a World Economic Forum report, Chinese EVs are much cheaper than their Western counterparts, with an average price of $34,400, compared to $55,242 in the U.S. The price gap is driven by lower labor costs, favorable government subsidies, and more affordable battery sourcing.

The United States government acknowledges the potential of EVs in the future of mobility and is trying its best to push for its development. On July 11, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced $1.7 billion in grants aimed at converting 11 auto plants in eight states to produce electric vehicles and components. Reuters reported on October 22 that U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm announced that the DOE is working quickly to finalize $1.7 billion in grants. The funds include $500 million for GM’s Michigan plant and $334.8 million for Stellantis’ Belvidere plant, with additional funds for the latter’s Indiana facility. According to another Reuters report from September 23, Monroe Capital LLC announced plans to launch the Drive Forward Fund LP, aiming to raise up to $1 billion to provide loans to smaller auto suppliers transitioning from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs. The White House supports this initiative, emphasizing that it will offer affordable capital to help small and medium-sized auto manufacturers refinance, grow, and diversify and will benefit over 250,000 workers. Moreover, new U.S. tariffs on Chinese EVs and stricter emissions regulations are pushing automakers to adapt their supply chains. Monroe CEO Ted Koenig highlighted the fund's importance in cultivating growth and innovation among suppliers struggling to secure financing for EV production. Our Methodology For this article, we identified over 30 EV manufacturers using the Finviz stocks screener and narrowed our list to 8 stocks most widely held by institutional investors. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their hedge funds which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of 912 elite hedge funds.

A group of school buses lined up in front of a large building, painted in bright colors. Number of Hedge Funds Holders: 24 One of the best EV stocks, Blue Bird Corporation (NASDAQ:BLBD) is an American manufacturer of school buses, specializing in low and zero-emission models. Its lineup includes traditional school buses, pupil activity buses, and specialized vehicles like security buses, ambulance buses, and blood donation buses. The company is committed to innovation and safety and transports around 25 million children daily. It currently operates over 20,000 low and zero-emission buses, including those powered by propane, natural gas, and electricity. In August, the company celebrated a milestone by delivering its 2,000th electric, zero-emission school bus. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Blue Bird (NASDAQ:BLBD) reported net sales of $333.4 million, representing a 13.3% increase from $294.3 million in the same quarter of the previous year. This growth was driven by changes in product mix, price adjustments due to rising inventory costs, and a slight uptick in unit bookings. Bus sales rose by $37.8 million, supported by a 13.2% increase in the average sales price and a 0.7% rise in booked units, despite ongoing supply chain challenges. Parts sales also saw a $1.3 million increase due to inflation-driven price hikes. Although the total cost of goods sold rose to $264.0 million, it improved as a percentage of net sales from 84.5% to 79.2%. Operating profit reached $39.7 million, significantly up from $19.4 million in the same quarter last year, thanks to a $23.6 million rise in gross profit, despite increasing operating expenses. On October 9, The Fly reported that BTIG initiated its coverage on Blue Bird (NASDAQ:BLBD) with a Buy rating and a price target of $55. The company ranks among the top three manufacturers of school buses and holds a strong position in the alternative fuel school bus market. According to the firm’s analyst, while Blue Bird also sells traditional diesel buses, it focuses on providing value rather than just selling a high volume of these buses. Despite the stock having doubled in value over the past year, BTIG remains optimistic about the company. It anticipates growth in the North American school bus market and expects a continued shift toward alternative fuels, which could help the company gain more market share. Overall BLBD ranks 6th on our list of the best EV stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of BLBD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLBD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The technology combines the high energy density of solid-state batteries with the practicality of traditional lithium-ion batteries, which improves vehicle performance and allows current owners to upgrade their battery packs for improved range.

Additionally, the Middle East is emerging as a significant market for esports, thanks to initiatives like Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, which aims to diversify the country’s economy. Major events, such as the Esports World Cup held in Riyadh, have drawn thousands of participants and substantial prize pools, showcasing the region's potential.

Title: Amazon's SWOT analysis: e-commerce giant's stock faces growth hurdles
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/amazons-swot-analysis-ecommerce-giants-stock-faces-growth-hurdles-93CH-3679170
Time Published: 2024-10-24T01:46:20Z
Full Content:
Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to dominate the e-commerce and cloud computing landscapes, but the tech giant faces mounting challenges as it seeks to maintain its robust growth trajectory. Recent analyst reports paint a picture of a company leveraging its strengths in retail and cloud services while grappling with intensifying competition and regulatory scrutiny. Amazon's core retail business has demonstrated resilience in the face of economic headwinds. The company's U.S. sales of apparel and footwear exceeded $68 billion in 2023, capturing a 13.2% share of all apparel sold in the U.S. and a 41.4% share of all apparel sold online. Analysts project continued growth in Amazon's softlines business, with expectations of a 12.6% increase to approximately $77 billion in 2024. However, there are signs of a slowdown in the company's retail momentum. The recent Prime Day event saw a deceleration in growth, with Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) growing by only 5% compared to the previous year's 25% growth. Additionally, Amazon's Total Addressable Market (TAM) growth share slowed to 16% in Q2 of 2024, indicating a normalization after the rapid acceleration experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing division, has shown signs of renewed vigor. Revenue growth for AWS has seen an uptick from 12% in Q2 2023 to 19% in Q2 2024. This acceleration is attributed to reduced optimization headwinds and increased demand for generative AI services. Analysts believe the future growth of AWS hinges on the trajectory of generative AI demand, particularly compute usage for training and inference, as well as adoption of Amazon's own AI products. While there is optimism about AWS's growth potential due to AI, the return on invested capital (ROIC) for generative AI at scale remains unproven, leading some analysts to project conservative high-teens percentage growth for AWS over the next few quarters. Amazon's advertising business has emerged as a significant profit driver, with the potential to reshape the company's financial profile. The introduction of ads on Prime Video, along with an ad-free tier option, is expected to contribute approximately $1.95 billion in incremental advertising revenue in 2024, growing to over $10 billion by 2028. The company's vertically integrated full-stack advertising platform is considered capable of delivering a range of advertising solutions from upper to lower funnel. Amazon's Prime membership provides valuable data and attribution capabilities, potentially unmatched by competitors. Some analysts believe the consensus may be underestimating Amazon's potential to gain market share in advertising, which could lead to more leverage in its e-commerce cost structure. Amazon continues to invest in long-term growth initiatives that could reshape its business model. Project Kuiper, the company's satellite internet service provider business, is expected to begin launching satellites by late 2024 with a significant portion in orbit by July 2026 and the full constellation by July 2029. While the estimated $10 billion investment in Project Kuiper is substantial, analysts consider it reasonable over a 3-4 year period given Amazon's robust operating income. Another area of focus is the company's investment in electric and autonomous vehicles. Amazon could potentially save approximately $20 billion annually by deploying autonomous electric vehicles for middle-mile transport and replacing internal combustion engine delivery vans with electric Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) vans. Electric vehicles can reduce per-mile energy costs by nearly 50%, and autonomous technology could lower driver-related costs, which represent over 40% of the cost per mile in middle-mile delivery. Despite its dominant position, Amazon faces increasing competition from both traditional retailers and new entrants. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) continues to gain market share in the retail space, while companies like Temu and Shein are emerging as formidable competitors in the e-commerce sector. The potential closure of the de minimis loophole could negatively impact Temu's unit economics, which are already unsustainable with losses of $35-40 per order. While this could benefit Amazon in the short term, it also highlights the volatile nature of the competitive landscape. Regulatory scrutiny remains a concern for Amazon, particularly regarding antitrust issues. The company's vast reach across multiple industries and its market power in e-commerce and cloud computing have drawn the attention of regulators in various jurisdictions. This ongoing scrutiny could potentially impact Amazon's ability to pursue certain strategic initiatives or acquisitions in the future. Amazon's retail business, while dominant, operates on relatively thin margins. The emergence of aggressive competitors like Temu and Shein, along with the continued strength of traditional retailers like Walmart, could put pressure on these margins. These competitors may force Amazon to engage in price wars or increase spending on marketing and customer acquisition, potentially eroding profitability. Moreover, as the e-commerce market matures, the cost of customer acquisition and retention may rise. Amazon may need to invest more heavily in its Prime program and other loyalty initiatives to maintain its market share, which could further impact margins. The company's ongoing investments in fulfillment and logistics, while necessary for long-term competitiveness, also represent significant costs that could weigh on profitability in the near term. Amazon's size and market power have attracted increasing regulatory attention in recent years. Antitrust concerns, particularly regarding the company's dual role as both a marketplace operator and a seller on its own platform, could lead to regulatory actions that limit Amazon's ability to leverage its various business segments. Potential outcomes of regulatory scrutiny could include forced divestitures of certain business units, restrictions on data usage across different segments, or limitations on Amazon's ability to promote its own products on its platform. Such actions could significantly impact the company's business model and growth prospects. Additionally, increased regulatory compliance costs and potential fines could negatively affect Amazon's financial performance. Artificial intelligence and automation represent significant opportunities for Amazon to enhance efficiency and drive profitability across its various business segments. In its retail operations, AI can optimize inventory management, improve demand forecasting, and personalize customer experiences, potentially leading to higher sales and lower costs. In AWS, the growing demand for AI services presents a substantial revenue opportunity. As more companies seek to implement AI solutions, AWS is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this market. The integration of AI into Amazon's advertising platform could also lead to more effective ad targeting and higher ad revenues. Automation, particularly in Amazon's fulfillment centers and delivery operations, has the potential to significantly reduce labor costs and improve operational efficiency. The company's investments in autonomous vehicles and robotic systems could lead to substantial cost savings in the long term, potentially transforming the economics of e-commerce fulfillment. Project Kuiper, Amazon's satellite internet initiative, represents a significant long-term growth opportunity. While the initial investment is substantial, the potential market for global broadband internet access is vast. Analysts estimate that Project Kuiper could generate $2.8 billion in revenue by 2028, capturing a 17% market share of the satellite internet market. Beyond direct revenue from internet subscriptions, Project Kuiper could create synergies with Amazon's other business segments. It could expand Amazon's customer base by providing internet access to previously underserved areas, potentially increasing e-commerce sales and Prime subscriptions. Additionally, the satellite network could enhance Amazon's global logistics and data capabilities, supporting its retail and cloud computing operations. The project also positions Amazon to compete in the growing space economy, potentially opening up new revenue streams in areas such as satellite-based services for businesses and governments. While the full revenue potential of Project Kuiper may take years to materialize, it represents a strategic investment in Amazon's long-term growth and diversification. Amazon continues to navigate a complex landscape of opportunities and challenges as it seeks to maintain its position as a leader in e-commerce and cloud computing. While the company faces headwinds from increased competition and regulatory scrutiny, its diverse business model and investments in future technologies provide multiple avenues for growth. Investors and analysts will be closely watching Amazon's ability to execute on its strategic initiatives and maintain profitability in the face of evolving market conditions.

I love the fact that the delicious bivalves are everywhere now, and that it’s a rare restaurant which doesn’t offer some kind of dressed oyster as a snack. But most places get their oysters from a single source, via a seafood supplier, and the majority offer just one type of oyster at a time. Not so at Sea Shanty in Blackrock, which buys its oysters direct from the farms and, on the night we visit, is offering a choice of oysters from Cromane in Kerry, Killough Bay in Co Down, Woodstown Bay in Co Waterford, Cooley in Co Louth, Connemara in Co Galway and Achill in Co Mayo. The only other place you’ll find Cromane oysters is Allta, and Sea Shanty is the sole Irish stockist of Killough Bay’s, and the only Dublin outlet for the oysters from Woodtown Bay.

As the cryptocurrency market emerges from a prolonged seven-month consolidation phase, following a parabolic uptrend for Bitcoin and various altcoins in the first quarter of 2024, crypto analyst OxNobler has boldly declared that today marks the start of the next significant altseason. In a recent post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), OxNobler shared insights on the Altcoin Indicator, which has just gone parabolic for the first time in three years. The analyst emphasized the cyclical nature of market phases, driven by capital inflows that shift from Bitcoin into larger-cap tokens before eventually reaching lower-cap altcoins, suggesting a growing liquidity movement that could fuel significant price surges across the altcoin landscape. Identifying key catalysts for the upcoming liquidity inflows, OxNobler pointed to several factors: the upcoming US election, where both candidates express support for Bitcoin, anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, the potential lifting of the cryptocurrency ban in China, and the expected payout of $16 billion from FTX in Q4 2024 to Q1 2025. By analyzing historical price movements and market cycles, OxNobler believes traders can position themselves for substantial gains in the months ahead. OxNobler has highlighted several altcoins that he believes are primed for growth in this new market phase.

Title: NVIDIA's SWOT analysis: ai chip leader faces challenges amid stock growth
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/nvidias-swot-analysis-ai-chip-leader-faces-challenges-amid-stock-growth-93CH-3679089
Time Published: 2024-10-24T00:35:15Z
Full Content:
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a dominant force in the graphics processing unit (GPU) and artificial intelligence (AI) chip markets, continues to capture investor attention with its robust financial performance and strategic positioning in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. As the company navigates through a period of unprecedented growth and innovation, it faces both significant opportunities and potential hurdles. NVIDIA's financial trajectory has been nothing short of impressive. The company has consistently outperformed market expectations, with analysts projecting substantial revenue growth from $60.9 billion in fiscal year 2024 to over $200 billion by fiscal year 2027. This remarkable expansion is primarily driven by the surging demand for AI chips and accelerated computing solutions. Earnings per share (EPS) are expected to see a similar upward trend, with estimates ranging from $1.15 in FY2024 to as high as $4.85 by FY2027. This projected growth has led many analysts to maintain bullish outlooks on NVIDIA's stock, with price targets ranging from $135 to $180. Despite these positive projections, NVIDIA faces some near-term challenges. The company has reported potential gross margin pressures due to the transition to its next-generation "Blackwell" GPU architecture. Some analysts anticipate a temporary dip in margins as the company ramps up production of these new chips, though this is generally viewed as a short-term issue that should resolve as yields improve. At the heart of NVIDIA's success lies its relentless focus on innovation. The company's current flagship AI chip, the Hopper architecture, has seen strong demand from cloud service providers and enterprises alike. However, much attention is focused on the upcoming Blackwell GPU, which is expected to drive significant revenue growth in the coming years. Recent reports have indicated a slight delay in the Blackwell architecture due to performance issues and chip respins. While this has caused some concern among investors, many analysts view this as a minor setback in the broader context of NVIDIA's product roadmap. The company is expected to begin shipping customer samples of Blackwell in the near term, with volume production ramping up in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025. NVIDIA's ability to quickly address technical challenges and provide alternative solutions has been a hallmark of its success. The company's CUDA programming platform continues to be a significant competitive advantage, offering developers a robust ecosystem for AI and high-performance computing applications. NVIDIA's dominance in the AI chip market is undeniable, with an estimated market share exceeding 95% in data center AI training and inference chips. This commanding position has allowed the company to capitalize on the explosive growth in AI investments across various industries. The total addressable market (TAM) for AI servers is expanding rapidly, with projections suggesting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 60% from 2023 to 2027. NVIDIA is well-positioned to capture a significant portion of this growth, given its strong relationships with hyperscalers and increasing penetration into enterprise markets. However, competition in the semiconductor space is intensifying. Rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are making significant investments in AI chip development, while cloud giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are exploring custom chip designs. NVIDIA's ability to maintain its technological edge and ecosystem advantages will be crucial in fending off these competitive threats. The data center segment has been the primary driver of NVIDIA's recent growth, with revenues in this area experiencing triple-digit year-over-year increases. This surge is largely attributed to the rapid adoption of AI and machine learning technologies across various industries. Hyperscale customers, including major cloud service providers, continue to invest heavily in AI infrastructure. Capital expenditure (CapEx) from these customers is seen as a key indicator of demand for NVIDIA's systems, with recent quarters showing significant growth. Some analysts project that peak CapEx spending may not occur until late 2025, suggesting a prolonged period of strong demand for NVIDIA's products. Enterprise adoption of AI technologies is also accelerating, presenting another avenue for growth. NVIDIA's efforts to expand its presence in on-premises AI solutions and edge computing are expected to contribute to its long-term revenue diversification. While AI and data center applications have taken center stage, NVIDIA's gaming business remains a significant contributor to its overall revenue. The company maintains a dominant position in the gaming GPU market, with a market share exceeding 75% in PC graphics cards. Analysts anticipate continued healthy demand from both esports enthusiasts and casual gamers, driven by ongoing product refresh cycles and the increasing graphical demands of modern games. NVIDIA's GeForce NOW cloud gaming service also represents a potential growth avenue as the company expands its presence in the gaming ecosystem. Other segments, such as professional visualization and automotive, are also showing promise. The automotive sector, in particular, is seen as a long-term growth opportunity as advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies become more prevalent. Despite NVIDIA's strong market position and growth prospects, the company faces several risks that warrant investor attention. Geopolitical tensions, particularly those involving China and Taiwan, pose potential threats to NVIDIA's supply chain and market access. The company's heavy reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for chip production is a point of concern given the ongoing geopolitical uncertainties in the region. Additionally, the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the potential for market saturation in certain segments could impact NVIDIA's growth trajectory. The company's ability to maintain its technological lead and fend off increasing competition will be crucial in sustaining its current market position. As competitors like AMD and Intel ramp up their AI chip development efforts, NVIDIA may face increased pressure on its market share and pricing power. Custom chip designs from major cloud providers could also reduce reliance on NVIDIA's products in certain applications. This intensified competition could lead to margin compression and slower growth rates in the long term. While the reported delay in the Blackwell architecture is not expected to significantly impact NVIDIA's long-term earnings, repeated delays or technical issues could erode customer confidence and provide opportunities for competitors to gain ground. This could result in lost revenue opportunities and potential market share erosion in key segments. NVIDIA's strong position in the AI chip market, coupled with the rapidly expanding AI server TAM, presents significant growth opportunities. As AI adoption accelerates across industries, NVIDIA's full-stack ecosystem and technological advantages could allow it to capture a substantial portion of this growing market. The company's ability to innovate and provide end-to-end solutions for AI workloads positions it well for sustained long-term growth. The projected 60% CAGR in the AI server market from 2023 to 2027 represents a massive opportunity for NVIDIA. As enterprises increasingly adopt AI technologies for various applications, including inference at the edge, NVIDIA's diverse product portfolio and strong brand recognition could drive significant revenue growth. The company's efforts to expand into new verticals and geographies could further amplify these opportunities. NVIDIA Corporation continues to be a focal point for investors and analysts alike, with its strong market position in AI chips and GPUs driving optimistic outlooks. While the company faces challenges such as increased competition and potential product delays, its robust financial performance and strategic positioning in high-growth markets suggest significant potential for continued expansion. As NVIDIA navigates the evolving landscape of AI and accelerated computing, its ability to innovate and adapt will be crucial in maintaining its leadership position and delivering value to shareholders.

Title: With 51% institutional ownership, Cochlear Limited (ASX:COH) is a favorite amongst the big guns

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Institutions' substantial holdings in Cochlear implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 45% ownership Insiders have bought recently If you want to know who really controls Cochlear Limited (ASX:COH), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 51% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cochlear. View our latest analysis for Cochlear Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Cochlear already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Cochlear's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Cochlear is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.2% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.7% by the third-largest shareholder. On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Cochlear Limited. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own AU$74m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. With a 48% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Cochlear. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Cochlear better, we need to consider many other factors. I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

Title: ECB’s Anti-Bitcoin Propaganda Debunked In Scathing Academic Rebuttal
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ecb-anti-bitcoin-propaganda-debunked/
Time Published: 2024-10-23T22:00:04Z
Full Content:
As a response to the latest anti-Bitcoin paper by the European Central Bank (ECB), a new academic paper titled “Challenging Bias in the ECB’s Bitcoin Analysis” has been published. Authored by Murray A. Rudd, along with co-authors Allen Farrington, Freddie New, and Dennis Porter, the paper offers a comprehensive critique of a recent working paper by ECB officials Ulrich Bindseil and Jürgen Schaaf. Dennis Porter, CEO and founder of Satoshi Action Fund, who initiated the paper with a few days announced the publication on X, stating, “₿REAKING: Full Academic Rebuttal to the anti-Bitcoin ECB paper officially published.” The original ECB paper by Bindseil and Schaaf portrays BTC as a speculative asset with limited intrinsic value and significant risks. It criticized BTC’s volatility, lack of productive contribution, and wealth concentration, while advocating for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as a superior solution for modern financial systems, as Bitcoinist reported. The rebuttal systematically addresses and refutes the key assertions made by Bindseil and Schaaf: Bindseil and Schaaf argue that the industry’s lobbying exerts disproportionate influence, skewing regulatory policy in its favor. The rebuttal counters this by highlighting the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. “not have a CEO, legal or marketing departments, or lobbyists: it is a neutral, global, leaderless protocol. Bitcoin advocates typically operate without the institutional backing enjoyed by the corporations that dominate the crypto industry,” the authors write. They point out that traditional financial institutions spend far more on lobbying than the nascent industry noting that in 2023, crypto-related lobbying expenditures in the US constituted less than 1% of financial sector lobbying expenditures. Addressing the claim that ownership is highly concentrated among a small number of large players, the rebuttal emphasizes that this view overlooks the widespread dispersion of BTC holdings. “Institutional and exchange wallets represent the holdings of diverse investors rather than single entities,” the authors explain. They note that many of the largest wallets belong to exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, as well as ETF issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity, who hold BTC on behalf of millions of users. The authors also challenge the notion that wealth concentration in coins is inherently unfair. “They imply that any form of inequality is unjust, yet fail to explain why this applies—a free market for Bitcoin has been available to all since its inception,” they write. “Unlike the vast majority of cryptocurrency tokens (‘altcoins’), Bitcoin had a fair and public launch. There was no pre-launch distribution of Bitcoin, no ‘founder shares,’ and no venture capital backers purchasing Bitcoin at a discount.” The ECB paper asserts that BTC’s rising price creates positive consumption effects for holders but does not increase overall productivity or economic growth. The rebuttal disputes this by highlighting BTC’s significant role in driving financial innovation and efficiency. “Bitcoin functions as a technological protocol, similar to the TCP/IP protocol that underpins the Internet, enabling the development of new financial services,” they argue. The authors also emphasize the impact in developing regions, particularly in the remittance market. “For countries that derive a large proportion of their GDP from remittances, slashing transaction costs could have dramatic impacts among the poorest households, who are traditionally excluded from banking services,” the paper notes. Bindseil and Schaaf suggest that Bitcoin’s price appreciation results in wealth redistribution, benefiting early adopters at the expense of non-holders and latecomers. The rebuttal counters that this argument disregards the voluntary nature of BTC markets, where participants freely choose to enter based on their own assessment of the asset’s potential. “Like early investors in stocks or venture capital, Bitcoin’s early adopters assumed significant risk in exchange for potentially high returns—an inherent feature of markets for emerging technologies,” they explain. They also highlight the broader implications of inflation, which redistribute wealth from savers to debt holders through inflationary policies. “Bitcoin’s fixed supply and deflationary characteristics counteract this erosion, offering a long-term store of value,” they assert. The ECB paper claims that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value and cannot be priced using traditional asset valuation models. The rebuttal argues that this narrow definition ignores the role that scarcity, decentralization, and utility as a store of value play in asset valuation. “Bitcoin operates similarly to gold, providing an alternative store of value, particularly in periods of monetary instability,” they state. They further assert, “Their argument is fundamentally flawed: they claim BTC cannot be considered money because it cannot be valued as a security, whereas the reality is that it cannot be valued as a security precisely because it is money.” Addressing the assertion that BTC’s price movements are indicative of speculative bubbles, the rebuttal points out that volatility is a characteristic of emerging technologies. “Bitcoin’s price appreciation is driven by its scarcity, adoption, network effects, and recognition of its utility as a hedge against fiat currency debasement,” they explain. The ECB paper contends that Bitcoin has not fulfilled its original promise as a global payment system due to high fees and scalability issues. The rebuttal counters this by highlighting technological advancements like the Lightning Network, which have dramatically improved Bitcoin’s scalability, reducing fees and increasing transaction speed. “By focusing on the early limitations, Bindseil and Schaaf fail to acknowledge the significant progress made in improving its scalability and efficiency,” they argue. They also address the authors’ critique of Nakamoto’s analysis of financial transactions, stating, “Nakamoto’s argument is not about the optionality of mediation in certain types of transactions; rather, it concerns the inherent costs and risks in a system where transactions rely on third-party credit institutions.” The authors also challenge the ECB paper’s framing of CBDCs as superior to BTC. They highlight the risks of centralization inherent in CBDCs, including concerns about privacy, political manipulation, and surveillance. “Bitcoin’s decentralized architecture ensures censorship resistance and financial sovereignty,” they assert, contrasting it with the centralization of CBDCs. The rebuttal raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest due to the authors’ roles within the ECB. Both Bindseil and Schaaf are deeply involved in developing the digital euro, a CBDC project that directly competes with decentralized digital currencies like BTC. “Their vested interest in advancing CBDCs likely skews their portrayal of Bitcoin as a speculative asset,” Porter et al. conclude. At press time, BTC traded at $66,465. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Tesla Cybertruck pushes past Ford Mach-E to become third best-selling EV in America | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Tesla’s Cybertruck was the third best-selling electric vehicle in the United States in the third quarter, beating out every other EV not made by Tesla. The only two vehicles that sold better were the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV. The polarizing truck notched this achievement despite selling at its most expensive trim model in the early going. It’s also a sign of just how much trouble major automakers like Ford and General Motors have run into in finding customers for their own EVs. Automotive research firm Kelley Blue Book pegged Tesla’s Cybertruck sales as third-best last week, notching over 16,000 sales. Ford only sold around 7,000 F-150 Lightnings in the third quarter, and just over 13,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs, according to sales data from the automaker. GM has seemingly found some early success with its new Blazer and Equinox EVs, but still only sold around 32,000 electric vehicles total last quarter. Rivian only delivered around 3,800 of its own electric pickup. Tesla confirmed the third-best accomplishment Wednesday when it released its financial results for the third quarter. Tesla also noted that the Cybertruck generated a positive gross margin — a measure of profitability that is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from revenue. Tesla also revealed it generated $25.2 billion in sales during the quarter and notched a $2.2 billion profit. Tesla’s profit was boosted by $739 million in sales of regulatory credits to other automakers — the second-highest amount it’s ever sold in a quarter, behind the second quarter of this year when it sold $890 million worth. Tesla said its profits were also boosted by the fact that it started shipping its Actually Smart Summon feature and its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software to Cybertruck owners, which allowed the company to recognize some of the money owners paid up front as revenue. Tesla’s relentless cost-cutting also plays into its profit figure. Tesla said in the shareholder letter that the cost of goods sold per vehicle is down to $35,100. Those Q3 figures helped push Tesla’s stock price up more than 9% in after-hours trading. Cost-cutting isn’t helping every part of the business, though. Tesla reported a 20% year-over-year growth in Supercharger stations, its slowest growth figure in years. This comes after Tesla gutted — and then started rehiring some of — its Supercharger team earlier this year as part of a massive company-wide layoff.

Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) plans to use Denmark's first sovereign artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer—powered by Nvidia (NVDA) technology—for drug discovery. On Wednesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and King Frederik X of Denmark unveiled "Gefion": a supercomputer named after a goddess in Danish mythology and equipped with 1,528 Nvidia GPUs. Sovereign AI refers to a nation’s capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks, Nvidia said. "The era of computer-aided drug discovery must be within this decade," Huang said in a news release. "I’m hoping that what the computer did to the technology industry, it will do for digital biology." The Novo Nordisk Foundation owns the supercomputer, and Novo Nordisk — the company behind popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy— will be among the first to use it. The foundation owns all of Novo Nordisk's Class A shares, which represent about a quarter of the company's capital. Nvidia and Denmark are “inventing something fundamentally new,” with the launch of Gefion, Huang said. “Gefion is going to be a factory of intelligence," Huang said. "This is a new industry that never existed before. It sits on top of the IT industry.” Novo Nordisk, along with the University of Copenhagen and others, are building a “genomic foundation model for discoveries in disease mutation analysis and vaccine design,” by training larger language models on Gefion. Other Gefion pilot projects include a Danish Meteorological Institute effort to deliver faster and more accurate weather forecasts and a University of Copenhagen project to carry out a large-scale simulation of quantum computer circuits.

Title: Amid an A.I. Chip Shortage, the GPU Rental Market Is Booming

GPUs, or graphic processing units, have become increasingly difficult to acquire as tech giants like OpenAI and Meta purchase mountains of them to power A.I. models. Amid an ongoing chip shortage, a crop of startups are stepping up to increase access to the highly sought-after A.I. chips—by renting them out. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. The GPU rental market is part of a niche, existing industry known as GPU-as-a-service where chip owners use an online marketplace to sell compute power to clients over fixed periods of time through the cloud. Typically, companies turn to major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud—which collectively hold a 63 percent market share of the global cloud computing market—to run A.I. workloads on their on-premise data centers. GPU-as-as-service, however, provides a more decentralized approach. Providers in that space partner with data centers and GPU owners globally to rent their clusters of chips to clients whenever the need arises. Renting computer power allows organizations with tight budgets, such as startups and academic institutions, access to high-performance GPUs for specific projects, said David Bader, director of the Institute for Data Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. “GPU-as-a-service has significantly leveled the playing field in A.I. and high-performance computing,” Bader told Observer. “Instead of making substantial upfront investments in hardware that quickly depreciates and becomes obsolete, companies can now access GPU power on-demand.” Even as supply chain constraints around GPUs start to ease, the rental market continues to grow. The GPU-as-a-service market, valued at $3.79 billion as of 2023, is expected to grow 21.5 percent annually to $12.26 billion by 2030 as the demand for advanced data analytics, like running machine learning algorithms, increases, according to data from Grand View Research. Some startups in the GPU rental space have seen demand surging since ChatGPT came out in November of 2022 as companies seek out compute power to build A.I. Jake Cannell, founder and CEO of Vast.ai, said his company’s customers were primarily cryptocurrency miners before the generative A.I. hype began. Today, more than half of the projects run on Vast.ai’s GPU rentals are A.I.-related. Clients include A.I. entrepreneurs, startups and academics building custom large language models with foundational models like OpenAI’s GPT and deploying LLMs on A.I.-related workloads like A.I.-image generator Stable Diffusion, Cannell said. The release of ChatGPT, combined with high demand for major cloud providers and the GPU shortage, pushed more customers to look for alternative options, which has in part accelerated demand for Vast.ai’s GPU rentals, according to Cannell. “That’s probably relaxed a bit now that production has caught up, but demand still seems really high and growing,” the CEO said. Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang recently said demand for Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips has been “insane” and that the company, which owns about 90 percent of the GPU market, plans to ramp up Blackwell production this year through 2026. Launched in 2017, Vast.ai is behind an online marketplace that connects owners of GPU clusters from Nvidia and AMD with organizations looking to rent compute power. As of late October, the marketplace offers 109 clusters of GPUs—including Nvidia’s popular H100 chips—housed in data centers and, in some cases, the owners’ garages scattered across the U.S. Europe, Asia and Australia, according to Cannell. By offering GPU clusters with different capacities, speeds and system requirements for various lengths of time, Vast.ai aims to provide renters with the freedom to pick GPUs required for specific projects and scale up-and-down depending on their need. For instance, a client developing an A.I. chatbot may initially rent 100 GPUs to train their model. If their product takes off, the client could ramp up their compute capacity by renting out thousands of GPUs. The flexibility to access different amounts of compute at different stages of product development, the company claims, is what makes GPU rentals over purchasing chips appealing. “Buying would only make sense if you have a much more predictable, steady demand for GPUs over a very long period of time,” Cannell said. “Only the hypercalers can formulate that,” referring to industry giants like OpenAI. While startups like Vast.ai launched prior to ChatGPT are seeing an uptick in interest, new startups have emerged following the chatbot’s release to tap into the growing GPU rental market. Foundry, a GPU marketplace built specifically for A.I. workloads, claims it has attracted “dozens” of customers since it launched its cloud platform in August and can significantly reduce compute costs by tapping into the excess power supply of pre-existing chips, according to CEO Jared Quincy Davis. The startup, which raised $80 million from investors like Sequoia and Lightspeed Ventures as of March, rents out GPUs through a mix of compute clusters the company owns and “underutilized clusters” sourced from partnerships with data centers. Foundry’s customers include companies in the technology, telecommunications, media and health care industries. Foundations and academic labs also use Foundry’s services. Common use cases include fine-tuning models like Meta’s Llama to exhibit desirable properties, building neural networks from scratch, and performing sentiment analyses—a deep learning technique used to analyze text to determine its emotional tone. Foundry even has clients renting GPUs to predict protein sequences for drug discovery, train models to translate rare languages, and build A.I. agents that can control websites without human intervention. “Much of the cutting-edge development that could previously only be conducted by labs like OpenAI and DeepMind will now be obtainable by others as Foundry makes GPU compute more accessible and affordable,” Davis, who previously worked at Google DeepMind as an engineer, told Observer. Some organizations are seeing the benefits of GPU rentals materialize. Bader, the professor at New Jersey Institute of Technology, said he’s seen his university use the GPU rental approach to “free up resources” for “critical activities” like research and development. The GPU rental model, he claims, is ideal for projects with “temporary” or “seasonal compute needs” and “eliminates the burden” of costly hardware management and maintenance. Bader said he has also seen small businesses the university collaborates with access the same GPU power as larger businesses. “I’ve witnessed countless startups benefit from this,” Bader said. “They no longer need millions in upfront investment for specialized hardware. Instead, they can prototype, test and iterate their algorithms using rented GPUs, ensuring that funds are directed towards development rather than infrastructure.” Still, Bader noted that renting out GPUs over purchasing them comes with some trade-offs. Performance on shared infrastructure can be inconsistent, which could slow down the execution of tasks like A.I. model training if there’s service disruptions. GPU rentals could also get expensive down the line despite upfront cost savings. The costs of transferring data between the cloud and the company could “add up quickly,” and for workloads that require real-time processing, clients that continuously hit latency issues might end up paying more than if they owned GPUs, according to Bader. The lack of control over the infrastructure could also be “problematic” for companies with strict security and compliance protocols. The future of the GPU rental market could also depend on how the chip industry evolves. After all, major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services are expected to continue expanding their product lines and are likely to absorb smaller companies, which could lower prices in the short term and limit consumer choice in the long run, according to Bader. Plus, supply chain delays could make it harder for cloud giants to get their hands on GPUs. Despite these concerns, the startups that spoke to Observer remain confident there will still be a need for their services in the following years as A.I. continues to grow. Vast.ai continues to improve its GPU matchmaker service and is getting more directly involved in use cases like LLM inference, especially for A.I. agents. Foundry plans to release additional features to increase the accessibility for its platform and make it more useful for A.I. developers to build advanced models. “Nvidia is still a leader, and I don’t see that changing overnight, but there is increasingly more competition,” Vast.ai CEO Cannnell said.

Saylor said that the right to self-custody applies to all individuals and institutions, who have the freedom to choose the form of custody. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. MicroStrategy executive chair Michael Saylor backtracked on his recent remarks about self-custody and clarified that he supports it as a fundamental right. Saylor said that the right to self-custody applies to all individuals and institutions who have the freedom to choose the form of custody. He added: “Bitcoin benefits from all forms of investment by all types of entities, and should welcome everyone.” Saylor’s clarification and response come after significant backlash from leading voices in the industry for statements he made during a recent interview. Jameson Lopp, co-founder and Chief Security Officer of CasaHODL, replied that self-custody is not about being paranoid, and argued that Saylor’s stance has long-term “negative ramifications” as it convinces people to fully trust third-party custodians. Citing these negative ramifications, Lopp mentions the increasing systemic risk through centralizing BTC in fewer places and leaving Bitcoin holders out of network governance activities, such as running a node. He added: “Self-custody is not merely important to individual Bitcoin holders. It’s important for the continued strengthening and improvement of the entire network.” Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin joined the choir of voices contrary to Saylor’s statement, calling his comments “insane.” Buterin said that Saylor is arguing in favor of a narrative where trusting regulated public entities, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, might protect crypto from stringent rules and law enforcement. However, the Ethereum co-founder added that there is “plenty of precedent” for how this strategy can fail, and he does not believe that trusting entities is aligned with the crypto ethos. Other notorious Bitcoin proponents, such as Jack Mallers and Adam Back, criticized Saylor’s remarks by highlighting that self-custody is a core part of the financial freedom enabled by Bitcoin.

Title: Big Tech is going all in on nuclear power as sustainability concerns around AI grow

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Artificial Intelligence has driven shares of tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to new highs this year. But the technology, which companies promise will revolutionize our lives, is driving something else just as high as stock prices: energy consumption. AI data centers use huge amounts of power and could increase energy demand by as much as 20% over the next decade, according to a Department of Energy spokesperson. Pair that with the continued growth of the broader cloud computing market, and you’ve got an energy squeeze. But Big Tech has also set ambitious sustainability goals focused on the use of low-carbon and zero-carbon sources to reduce its impact on climate change. While renewable energy like solar and wind are certainly part of that equation, tech companies need uninterruptible power sources. And for that, they’re leaning into nuclear power. Tech giants aren’t just planning to hook into existing plants, either. They’re working with energy companies to bring mothballed facilities like Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island back online and looking to build small modular reactors (SMRs) that take up less space than traditional plants and, the hope is, are cheaper to construct. But there are still plenty of questions as to whether these investments in nuclear energy will ever pan out, not to mention how long it will take to build any new reactors. While solar and wind power projects provide clean energy, they still aren't the best option for continuous power. That, experts say, is where nuclear energy comes in. “Nuclear energy is, effectively, carbon-free,” explained Ed Anderson, Gartner distinguished vice president and analyst. “So it becomes a pretty natural choice given they need the energy, and they need green energy. Nuclear [power] is a good option for that.” The US currently generates the bulk of its electricity via natural gas plants that expel greenhouse gases. As of 2023, nuclear power produced slightly more electricity than coal, as well as solar power plants. Last week, Google signed a deal to purchase power from Kairos Power’s small modular reactors, with Google saying the first reactor should be online by 2030, with plants expected to be deployed in regions to power Google’s data centers, though Kairos didn’t provide exact locations. Amazon quickly followed by saying just two days later that it is investing in three companies — Energy Northwest, X-energy, and Dominion Energy — to develop SMRs. The plan is for Energy Northwest to build SMRs using technology from X-energy in Washington State and for Amazon and Dominion Energy to look at building an SMR near Dominion’s current North Anna Power Station in Virginia. Last month, Microsoft entered into a 20-year power purchasing agreement with Constellation Energy, under which the company will source energy from one of Constellation's previously shuttered reactors at Three Mile Island by 2028. Three Mile Island suffered a meltdown of its other reactor in 1979, but according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, there was no serious impact to nearby people, plants, or animals, as the plant itself kept much of the dangerous radiation from escaping. In 2023, Microsoft announced it would source power from the Sam Altman-chaired nuclear fusion startup Helion by 2028. Altman also chairs the nuclear fission company Oklo, which plans to build a micro-reactor site in Idaho. Nuclear fusion is the long-sought process of combining atoms that produces power without dangerous nuclear waste. No commercial applications of such plants currently exist. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has also founded and currently chairs TerraPower, a company working to develop an advanced nuclear plant at a site in Wyoming. Nuclear power output has remained stagnant for years. According to US Energy Information Administration press officer, Chris Higginbotham, nuclear power has contributed about 20% of US electricity generation since 1990. Part of the reason has to do with the fear of meltdowns, like the one at Three Mile Island, as well as the meltdowns at Chernobyl in Ukraine in 1986 and the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan in 2011. Chernobyl was the worst meltdown ever, spreading radioactive contamination across areas of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and Belarus, resulting in thyroid cancer in thousands of children who drank milk that was contaminated with radioactive iodine, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Plant workers and emergency personnel were also exposed to high levels of radiation at the scene. The Fukushima plant suffered multiple meltdowns as a result of a massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami, which caused significant damage to three of the plant's six reactors. But according to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) as of 2021, “no adverse health effects among Fukushima residents have been documented that could be directly attributed to radiation exposure from the accident.” Outside of the perception, nuclear plants are expensive and take time to construct. Georgia Power’s two Vogtle reactors came online in 2023 and 2024, after years of delays and billions in cost overruns. The reactors, known as Unit 3 and Unit 4 were originally expected to be completed in 2017 and cost $14 billion, but the second reactor only started commercial operations in April this year. The final price tag for the work is estimated to top out at $31 billion, according to the Associated Press. The explosion in cheap energy from natural gas has also made it difficult for nuclear plants to compete financially. Now nuclear companies are hoping SMRs will lead the way in building out new nuclear energy capacity. But don’t expect them to start popping up for a while. “The SMR conversation is really long term,” Jefferies managing director and research analyst Paul Zimbardo told Yahoo Finance. “I'd say almost all of the projections are into the 2030s. The Amazons, the Googles, some of the standalone SMR developers, 2030 to 2035, which is also what some of the utilities are saying as well.” What’s more, Zimbardo says, power generated by SMRs is expected to cost far more than traditional plants, not to mention wind and solar projects. “Some of the projections are well above $100 a megawatt hour,” Zimbardo explained. “To put it in context, an existing nuclear plant has a cost profile of around $30 a megawatt hour. Building new wind, solar, depending on where you are in the country, can be as low as $30 a megawatt hour, or $60 to $80 a megawatt hour. So it's a very costly solution.” Not everyone is buying the promise of SMRs, either. Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, says the small-scale reactors are still an untested technology. “Despite what one might think of all the brain power at these tech companies, I don't think they've done their due diligence,” Lyman told Yahoo Finance. “Or they're willing to entertain this as a kind of side show just so they have all their bases covered to deal with this postulated massive expansion and demand for data centers.” Lyman also takes issue with the idea that SMRs will be able to get up and running quickly and begin providing reliable power around the clock at low cost. “The historical development of nuclear power shows that it's a very exacting technology, and it requires time, requires effort, requires a lot of money and patience,” he said. “And so I think the nuclear industry has been trying to make itself look relevant, despite their recent failures to meet cost and timeliness targets.” Still, with tech companies promising an AI revolution that requires power-hungry data centers, nuclear may be the only realistic green choice until solar and wind can take over permanently.

Building new wind, solar, depending on where you are in the country, can be as low as $30 a megawatt hour, or $60 to $80 a megawatt hour. So it's a very costly solution.” Not everyone is buying the promise of SMRs, either. Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, says the small-scale reactors are still an untested technology. “Despite what one might think of all the brain power at these tech companies, I don't think they've done their due diligence,” Lyman told Yahoo Finance. “Or they're willing to entertain this as a kind of side show just so they have all their bases covered to deal with this postulated massive expansion and demand for data centers.” Lyman also takes issue with the idea that SMRs will be able to get up and running quickly and begin providing reliable power around the clock at low cost. “The historical development of nuclear power shows that it's a very exacting technology, and it requires time, requires effort, requires a lot of money and patience,” he said. “And so I think the nuclear industry has been trying to make itself look relevant, despite their recent failures to meet cost and timeliness targets.” Still, with tech companies promising an AI revolution that requires power-hungry data centers, nuclear may be the only realistic green choice until solar and wind can take over permanently.

Title: Big Tech is going all in on nuclear power as sustainability concerns around AI grow

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Artificial Intelligence has driven shares of tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to new highs this year. But the technology, which companies promise will revolutionize our lives, is driving something else just as high as stock prices: energy consumption. AI data centers use huge amounts of power and could increase energy demand by as much as 20% over the next decade, according to a Department of Energy spokesperson. Pair that with the continued growth of the broader cloud computing market, and you’ve got an energy squeeze. But Big Tech has also set ambitious sustainability goals focused on the use of low-carbon and zero-carbon sources to reduce its impact on climate change. While renewable energy like solar and wind are certainly part of that equation, tech companies need uninterruptible power sources. And for that, they’re leaning into nuclear power. Tech giants aren’t just planning to hook into existing plants, either. They’re working with energy companies to bring mothballed facilities like Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island back online and looking to build small modular reactors (SMRs) that take up less space than traditional plants and, the hope is, are cheaper to construct. But there are still plenty of questions as to whether these investments in nuclear energy will ever pan out, not to mention how long it will take to build any new reactors. While solar and wind power projects provide clean energy, they still aren't the best option for continuous power. That, experts say, is where nuclear energy comes in. “Nuclear energy is, effectively, carbon-free,” explained Ed Anderson, Gartner distinguished vice president and analyst. “So it becomes a pretty natural choice given they need the energy, and they need green energy. Nuclear [power] is a good option for that.” The US currently generates the bulk of its electricity via natural gas plants that expel greenhouse gases. As of 2023, nuclear power produced slightly more electricity than coal, as well as solar power plants. Last week, Google signed a deal to purchase power from Kairos Power’s small modular reactors, with Google saying the first reactor should be online by 2030, with plants expected to be deployed in regions to power Google’s data centers, though Kairos didn’t provide exact locations. Amazon quickly followed by saying just two days later that it is investing in three companies — Energy Northwest, X-energy, and Dominion Energy — to develop SMRs. The plan is for Energy Northwest to build SMRs using technology from X-energy in Washington State and for Amazon and Dominion Energy to look at building an SMR near Dominion’s current North Anna Power Station in Virginia. Last month, Microsoft entered into a 20-year power purchasing agreement with Constellation Energy, under which the company will source energy from one of Constellation's previously shuttered reactors at Three Mile Island by 2028. Three Mile Island suffered a meltdown of its other reactor in 1979, but according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, there was no serious impact to nearby people, plants, or animals, as the plant itself kept much of the dangerous radiation from escaping. In 2023, Microsoft announced it would source power from the Sam Altman-chaired nuclear fusion startup Helion by 2028. Altman also chairs the nuclear fission company Oklo, which plans to build a micro-reactor site in Idaho. Nuclear fusion is the long-sought process of combining atoms that produces power without dangerous nuclear waste. No commercial applications of such plants currently exist. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has also founded and currently chairs TerraPower, a company working to develop an advanced nuclear plant at a site in Wyoming. Nuclear power output has remained stagnant for years. According to US Energy Information Administration press officer, Chris Higginbotham, nuclear power has contributed about 20% of US electricity generation since 1990. Part of the reason has to do with the fear of meltdowns, like the one at Three Mile Island, as well as the meltdowns at Chernobyl in Ukraine in 1986 and the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan in 2011. Chernobyl was the worst meltdown ever, spreading radioactive contamination across areas of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and Belarus, resulting in thyroid cancer in thousands of children who drank milk that was contaminated with radioactive iodine, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Plant workers and emergency personnel were also exposed to high levels of radiation at the scene. The Fukushima plant suffered multiple meltdowns as a result of a massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami, which caused significant damage to three of the plant's six reactors. But according to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) as of 2021, “no adverse health effects among Fukushima residents have been documented that could be directly attributed to radiation exposure from the accident.” Outside of the perception, nuclear plants are expensive and take time to construct. Georgia Power’s two Vogtle reactors came online in 2023 and 2024, after years of delays and billions in cost overruns. The reactors, known as Unit 3 and Unit 4 were originally expected to be completed in 2017 and cost $14 billion, but the second reactor only started commercial operations in April this year. The final price tag for the work is estimated to top out at $31 billion, according to the Associated Press. The explosion in cheap energy from natural gas has also made it difficult for nuclear plants to compete financially. Now nuclear companies are hoping SMRs will lead the way in building out new nuclear energy capacity. But don’t expect them to start popping up for a while. “The SMR conversation is really long term,” Jefferies managing director and research analyst Paul Zimbardo told Yahoo Finance. “I'd say almost all of the projections are into the 2030s. The Amazons, the Googles, some of the standalone SMR developers, 2030 to 2035, which is also what some of the utilities are saying as well.” What’s more, Zimbardo says, power generated by SMRs is expected to cost far more than traditional plants, not to mention wind and solar projects. “Some of the projections are well above $100 a megawatt hour,” Zimbardo explained. “To put it in context, an existing nuclear plant has a cost profile of around $30 a megawatt hour.

Title: What CIOs and other tech leaders are prioritizing as they plan their 2025 budgets

As Mike Anderson plans tech spending for next year, the technology leader is asking all of Netskope’s vendors for fresh updates about their generative artificial intelligence product roadmap and pricing plans. “We’re not making any long-term commitments to any software providers,” says Anderson, who serves as chief digital and information officer at the cloud-based security company. “The change is happening so rapidly.” Surveys have consistently shown that chief information officers and other technology C-suite leaders will spend more on generative AI next year. But now two years into the generative AI journey, they are also thinking more about getting a return on those investments, while also expressing increased skepticism about how AI is priced. The per-user cost for AI copilots, often $30 for each employee, is a frequent pain point. There is also wariness about “AI washing,” which is the notion that vendors are adding fees for flimsy new AI features with little to no business value. “A lot of people are scratching their heads,” says Anderson. “I don’t really know if I can afford $30 per user.” McKinsey senior partner Aamer Baig agrees, sharing “It’s safe to say the CIOs are very irritated by these enterprise vendors pricing strategies for generative AI.” CIOs say they are intrigued and even welcome some recent industry pricing pivots, most notably by Salesforce, to consumption-based pricing. “If I get to a point where I have good predictability around what my usage is, I’m sure that the vendors will negotiate some type of a contract that helps me control my costs,” says Anderson. Baig says McKinsey’s clients are paying attention to the one-time costs of AI investments, but also discovering that for every $1 spent on developing an AI model, they are spending $3 on change management, meaning training staff and actively tracking their performance and the value of their investments in the technology. “There have been some surprises,” says Baig. Principal Financial CIO Kathy Kay says the financial investment management and insurance company has evolved budget planning from an annual cycle to a quarterly cadence, allowing for more fluidity to move dollars depending on new priorities or changes to the business. Kay says she will spend more on generative AI in 2025, but that the core function of IT is to also find ways to do work cheaper and faster. “I’m not a proponent of just asking to increase my spending without good business rationale,” says Kay. Dave Williams, chief information and digital officer at Merck, anticipates the pharmaceuticals company will also increase spending on generative AI, as well as cybersecurity, edge computing, drug development, and to make manufacturing more efficient. “We see a huge opportunity to leverage cloud, gen AI, and the combination [of those technologies], to accelerate the core of what we do, which is get new vaccines and medicines to patients faster,” says Williams. Rajeev Rajan, chief technology officer for Atlassian, says the software provider is “very prudent about how much we spend on R&D. We look at our overall revenue, our overall budget, and we keep it in good proportion.” He’s also spending more on AI, but a yearslong project to get customers to migrate data from on-premise to the cloud is wrapping up, requiring less funding. Atticus Tysen, Intuit’s chief information security officer, says the financial software company starts annual budget planning by first allocating dollars toward security, and then everything else. “As the CISO and the CIO, I have to be careful about that and not take up all the money,” says Tysen. One big priority for 2025 is Intuit’s continued embrace of a multi-cloud strategy. While Intuit primarily leans on Amazon Web Services, it has acquired brands, like Credit Karma, which have built their data processing on rival offerings. By working with more than one cloud provider, Intuit can select the best service from AWS or Microsoft or Google that will match a specific need. “There’s no reason to really move or change that,” says Tysen, regarding keeping Credit Karma on Google Cloud Platform. “They wouldn’t get any customer benefit out of it. There wouldn’t be any particular cost savings.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. AI agents still come with a lot of questions. The Wall Street Journal takes a look at the emerging world of AI agents, which rely on generative AI and promise to follow more intricate instructions than a chatbot. But big questions remain on how much human intervention will be needed, the best governance to protect the data that’s being used in a new way, and what kind of autonomous decision-making will be allowed for AI agents versus prior forms of automation. There’s also the ongoing issue of the price that vendors hope to command, either through per-user or outcome-based fees, and what businesses are ultimately willing to pay. OpenAI and Bain strike AI partnership; but tension emerges with Microsoft. OpenAI and Bain & Co. are expanding their pact to sell ChatGPT and other tools to clients of the consulting firm, the Wall Street Journal reports, and Bain is putting about 50 employees into the joint effort to build industry-specific AI tools, something many tech leaders have been waiting for. Separately, the New York Times has reported on tension between OpenAI and Microsoft, which has already put $13 billion into the upstart. At issue: OpenAI's desire to secure more computing power and reduce expenses, and Microsoft's worries about becoming too reliant on OpenAI for its AI advancements. Meta announces fresh rounds of layoffs. The social media giant, which announced mass rounds of layoffs in 2022 and 2023, will lay off about 100 employees across various departments, including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs, Fortune reported. The latest cuts are due to reorganizing the structure of those teams to align with long-term strategic goals, Meta says, differing from the larger, mass layoffs in the past couple of years. Separately, Meta fired some staffers from the Los Angeles office for abusing the company’s $25 meal stipend and spending money from the corporate perk on groceries, household items, and meals when they weren’t even in the office. Gopuff fires CTO months after battery arrest. Sreekant Kotay, who has served as CTO for grocery-delivery company Gopuff, was reportedly fired on Friday several months after he was arrested on a felony battery charge and for alleged possession of illegal drugs, The Information reports. Citing court records, the outlet also reports that Kotay has pleaded not guilty to all three charges. Kotay has served as CTO of Gopuff for two stints, from 2017 through 2019 and again in early 2023 until he was ousted last week. He's also previously served as CTO at Comcast and as SVP of technology at AOL. Most companies still aren’t data-ready for generative AI. A new report by IT consulting firm Accenture found that six out of ten "reinvention-ready" companies—the early movers on generative AI—have their data assets modernized for gen AI use cases, have clear data governance, and are able to trace their data from the original source through the AI lifecycle. All other companies, that fall into less advanced AI criteria like "automated" or "foundational," aren't as far along in their AI data readiness journey. One barrier that automated and foundational companies face is that their data sits with a wide array of vendors, but there are often slight data variations, preventing “a single source of truth,” says Laura Peterson, senior managing director at Accenture. “It is actually core to being able to run your business in a different way,” says Peterson, regarding the importance of performing “data cleanup” that’s more comprehensive than a one-time event that tends to be tied to system updates. She also advises that IT and business leaders partner to get on the same page and make it a priority.

Title: Dow Drops 500 Points To 2-Week Low As Magnificent 7 Sheds $430 Billion

A rare down week for the stock market got dimmer Wednesday, as an $11 billion hamburger selloff and big-ticket losses for big technology stocks pushed U.S. equity indexes to their worst day in six weeks. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The leading S&P 500 fell 0.9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.6% and the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1%, or 410 points. The Dow and Nasdaq suffered their worst daily declines since the first week of September and all three registered their lowest close in two weeks. Contributing most to the share price-weighted Dow’s dip was McDonald’s, as its stock’s 5% ($15 per share) loss Wednesday sent shares of the restaurant chain to their worst day since March 2020 as investors reacted to news of an E. Coli outbreak tied to its Quarter Pounder hamburger. The market capitalization-weighted Nasdaq and S&P were dragged down by big tech, as the “magnificent seven” group including the U.S.’ only six trillion-dollar companies and Tesla fell shed a combined $352 billion in Wednesday trading. Each of the magnificent seven stocks dropped at least 0.7%: Amazon, Facebook parent Meta and Nvidia shares fell about 3% apiece, Apple and Tesla declined 2%, Google parent Alphabet lost 1.4% and Microsoft dipped 0.7%. In addition to isolated catalysts like the McDonald’s foodborne illness agita and an analyst report pointing to lighter-than-hoped sales for Apple’s iPhone 16, there was a familiar foe behind much of the losses: climbing Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose Wednesday to a 3-month high of over 4.25%. The increase comes amid fresh worries about what next month’s election will mean for the U.S’ surging national debt and declining expectations for further interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in the wake of inflation concerns and solid economic growth data. Higher yields on government bonds often lead to pricier corporate borrowing, eating into profit margins, and big tech companies are typically seen as one of the groups most directly hurt by higher yields as future profits are discounted in valuation models. Even with the S&P well on its way to its first three-day losing streak since the first week of September, the baseline U.S. index is still just 1.6% below its all-time closing high set Friday. The S&P remains up 21% this year, excluding dividends, and it has climbed 0.2% in October after posting its best opening nine months since 1997. Tesla will report third-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, kicking off big tech earnings season. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk wants the FDA to stop pharmacies from making off-brand versions of popular weight loss meds

Time Published: 2024-10-23T17:42:59Z

Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO-1.56%) is asking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prohibit compounding pharmacies from making off-brand versions of semaglutide, the active ingredient in its blockbuster weight loss and diabetes medications. The Danish pharma giant argued in documents submitted to the agency this week that the drug is too complex for pharmacies to make safely and that it belongs in the FDA’s Demonstrable Difficulties for Compounding Lists. Drugs included in these lists are off-limits for compounding pharmacies, regardless of a drug’s shortage status. The move comes as both Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly, the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, are trying to curb the sale of off-brand versions of their popular GLP-1 treatments. GLP-1 drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have become highly sought after for their remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Normally, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act bans compounding drugs that are just copies of existing medications. However, if a drug is in short supply, it’s not seen as commercially available by the FDA. This loophole has led several digital health companies, online pharmacies, and wellness spas to produce and sell cheaper versions of brand-name weight-loss drugs during recent shortages. Novo Nordisk told the FDA that its testing of compounded formulations of semaglutide found impurities that could put patients at risk. An industry group has already come out against those claims. “So Novo Nordisk is apparently so deeply concerned about patient safety that it’s taken them a whopping two-and-a-half years while their drug has been in shortage to conclude that the semaglutide API [active pharmaceutical ingredient] is so demonstrably difficult for compounding pharmacies to prepare that FDA now needs to place it off-limits for compounding?” said Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding CEO Scott Brunner in statement emailed to Quartz. “To me, this looks more like desperation and an attempt by Novo to protect its revenue stream than a serious scientific argument,” Brunner added. Earlier this month, the FDA marked the shortage of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound, as resolved. Eli Lilly (LLY-1.32%) quickly started sending cease-and-desist letters to any company selling copycat versions. In response, the Outsourcing Facilities Association filed a lawsuit in Texas against the FDA, challenging its decision to remove tirzepatide from its shortage list and demanding that the move be reversed. In its lawsuit, obtained by Ars Technica, the group called the FDA’s decision “reckless and arbitrary” and argued that it would “deprive patients of a vital treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity.” In a court filing, the FDA said pharmacists could resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision to remove the drug from its shortage list. While compounding is now temporarily allowed, Eli Lilly has shifted its strategy to filing false advertising lawsuits against medical spas and online sellers marketing tirzepatide products.

In a Wednesday report from the global investment firm, analysts Gautam Chhugani, Mahika Sapra, and Sanskar Chindalia wrote that they believe the biggest digital coin will hit $200,000 by the end of 2025. And that’s being "conservative," they said. “With accelerating institutional adoption, we expect Bitcoin to triple from here to attain a cycle-high price of $200,000 by 2025 end,” the report read. Bitcoin is now trading for just under $65,750, dropping by nearly 3% in a seven-day period. At the weekend, it was priced above $69,000 for the first time in nearly three months. The asset hit an all-time high price of $73,737 in March. Bernstein analysts had previously predicted that Bitcoin could reach $150,000 in 2025 due to the huge demand for newly approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. They continued to argue in Wednesday’s report that demand for these products will push the asset higher. The ETFs—which trade on stock exchanges and allow investors to buy the digital asset through their brokerage accounts—have been hugely successful and allowed institutions such as Morgan Stanley to safely get exposure to Bitcoin. Last week, the funds—managed by Wall Street titans such as BlackRock and Fidelity—topped $20 billion in total inflows to date, despite only being approved in January. The report added that American Bitcoin mining companies and software firm MicroStrategy, which in 2020 added the cryptocurrency and now securitizes Bitcoin, would continue to rally. Such investments are used by investors to get exposure to the crypto world without owning Bitcoin. MicroStrategy is the largest corporate treasury reserve holder of Bitcoin in the world, with over $16 billion worth of BTC.

We recently published a list of 7 Best Delivery Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where DoorDash Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) stands against other best delivery stocks to invest in now. The delivery and courier industry is diverse, encompassing a wide range of services that connect businesses and consumers through various shipping methods. Parcel delivery services are a major component, with companies offering both domestic and international shipping options, driven by the rise of e-commerce. Another significant segment is food delivery platforms. These platforms connect hungry customers with local eateries, creating a new business model that thrives on convenience. Overall, the delivery industry is evolving rapidly, with diverse players working to meet the growing expectations for speed and reliability in shipping services. According to Zion Market Research, the global on-demand delivery market was valued at $15.19 billion in 2023. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.90% during 2024-2032 to reach $83.82 billion by ​the end of the forecast period. In 2023, the Asia-Pacific region led the market in revenue and is projected to maintain its dominance throughout the forecast period. Read Also: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In This growth is fueled by increasing consumer expectations for fast and reliable delivery services, particularly same-day and next-day options. Experts highlight that the demand for quick deliveries has led to substantial investments in last-mile delivery solutions and advanced technologies, such as automation and artificial intelligence (AI). In 2024, consumers have continued to prioritize free and fast shipping for their online orders, according to recent data from Digital Commerce 360 and Bizrate Insights. A survey of 1,013 online shoppers revealed that 81.34% consider free shipping their top priority when receiving deliveries.

AI and automation are key trends that are significantly transforming the delivery services industry, making operations more efficient and responsive to consumer demands. For example, companies like DHL Express have introduced the DHLBot in Singapore and South Korea. The DHLBot is an AI-powered robotics arm that can sort over 1,000 small parcels per hour with 99% accuracy. This technology not only speeds up the sorting process but also reduces labor costs and minimizes errors, allowing for quicker deliveries. As the industry evolves, it is clear that AI and automation will play a crucial role in shaping the future of delivery services.

(NASDAQ:DASH) in its “U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy” second-quarter investor letter: “Our preferences in the Consumer-oriented sectors lean toward value-oriented or specialty retailers, franchise models, or premium brands. New to the strategy was the online food delivery platform and logistics provider DoorDash Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) Since its IPO in 2021, the company’s scale has grown to entrench it with customers and consumers, though we have been cautious about its high valuation. Recently, the company reported lower-than-expected guidance for future margins and that caused its shares to sell off. In our view, DoorDash was appropriately investing for future growth and absorbing recent increased wage costs. Believing this short-term price dislocation made for an attractive entry price, we began buying, and DoorDash was up 2% through the end of the quarter.” Overall, DASH ranks 3rd on our list of best delivery stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of delivery companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DASH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Kamala Harris Has More Billionaires Prominently Backing Her Than Trump—Warren Buffett, Bill Gates Weigh In (Update)

Time Published: 2024-10-23T16:23:28Z
Full Content:
Forbes found at least 100 billionaires in the corners of either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris—with many more backing Harris—but unlike the world’s richest man Elon Musk, who stumps extensively on Trump’s behalf, many have elected to watch from the sidelines, like Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg. Trump and Harris during their September presidential debate. Our breakdown records 81 billionaires supporting Harris and 50 backing Trump so far (see the lists for both below). Many more billionaires may still financially back a candidate, but their donations won’t be learned until after the election, when final Federal Election Commission reports are issued in December. Billionaires leaning toward Harris may seem incongruous, since she often criticizes Trump for advocating for policies favorable toward billionaires—but there are practical reasons why the ultra wealthy may favor Harris. A letter signed by more than a dozen billionaires last month endorsing Harris explained their belief Harris “will continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment,” indicating the support for the status quo as the U.S. economy and stock market exhibit strength, while a recent survey of millionaire investors—which found a 57% to 43% split in Harris’s favor—identified technology, healthcare and sustainability stocks as the sectors most poised to benefit from a Harris win, a mix friendly to many of her billionaire backers from Silicon Valley, who grew familiar with Harris during her time as a California prosecutor. Forbes will update this list through Election Day. Jeff Bezos, left, Larry Page, second from left, Sheryl Sandberg, former chief operating officer of ... [+] Facebook, then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence and then-President-elect Donald Trump meet in 2016. Bill Gates: Though his ex-wife French Gates is among Harris’ deepest backers—her reported $13 million donation to Harris groups would place her among the top individual donors this cycle—the Microsoft cofounder Gates has not officially endorsed a candidate, but appeared to offer positive words toward Harris in a July interview, saying it is “great to have somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI and how we shape that in the right way.” But “I don’t tell other people how to vote” due to his work with his nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates added. UPDATE (Oct. 22): Gates told allies he donated $50 million to the non-profit wing of a Democratic political action committee supporting Harris, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the situation. The bombshell report goes against Gates’ history of public nonpartisanship. Though Gates did not confirm the donation to the Times, he hinted at his Harris backing in a statement, saying he supports “candidates who demonstrate a clear commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty and fighting climate change” and “this election is different” than those of the past. Jamie Dimon: Trump shared a false social media post touting Dimon’s endorsement, but the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, did not endorse any candidate, according to his spokesperson. Still, some see hints in Dimon’s words. He’s been outspoken about the election, penning an opinion in The Washington Post calling on voters “to elect a president who is dedicated to the ideals that define and unite us.” UPDATE (Oct. 22): The Times reported Dimon has privately endorsed Harris and has indicated he’s open to a role in her administration, including the top economic role of Treasury secretary. Dimon spokesman Joe Evangelisti told the Times the banker “has never publicly endorsed a presidential candidate.” Dimon’s wife, Judith Kent, has donated more than $250,000 to Democratic causes in 2024 through the couple’s joint The James and Judith K Dimon Foundation, according to Federal Election Commission filings. A source close to Dimon told Forbes that the JPMorgan chief is not considering a role in either a Harris or Trump administration. Steve Ballmer, UPDATE (Oct. 22): Ballmer, the owner of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers and former chief executive of Microsoft, made clear in an interview with Forbes last week he will not endorse a candidate, though he has shelled out more than $40 million to his not-for-profit company USAFacts to arm the public with easily accessible government data. “At some point all the money does is help bid up the price of ads on Facebook,” Ballmer bemoaned to Forbes about the impact traditional political spending can have. Connie Ballmer, the wife of the world’s 10th-richest person, has donated more than $300,000 to Democratic causes this year, according to government records, but “I don't control my wife and would never want to,” Steve Ballmer added about what that indicates about his own leanings. Jeff Bezos: The Amazon founder and world’s fourth-richest man wrote Trump “showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire” following the assassination attempt at a July 13 rally, but Bezos has not endorsed or financially backed, even though he has publicly warred with Trump during his presidency. He celebrated Biden’s election in 2020 with an Instagram post noting the Biden win indicated “unity, empathy, and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era.” Warren Buffett: Though Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett said in 2020 he’s a Democrat and clapped back at Trump in 2016 for an income tax jab, Buffett, the world’s sixth-richest person, has also stayed quiet this cycle. UPDATE (Oct. 23): Berkshire released a statement Wednesday that Buffett won’t publicly “endorse and support political candidates.” Buffett explained to CNBC he’s “worried about people impersonating” him and “nobody should believe anybody saying I’m telling them how to...vote.” Mark Zuckerberg: Trump told New York Magazine that Zuckerberg said to him he can’t “vote for a Democrat in this election” after the assassination attempt. But a Meta spokesperson said Zuckerberg, the third-wealthiest person on the planet, is “not endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.” In 2020, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $419 million toward organizations supporting in-person voting during the pandemics. The Meta CEO and Facebook cofounder called Trump’s response to the assassination attempt “badass” in a July interview. Ray Dalio: Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, told CNBC last month it’s the “most consequential” election of his, but he won’t endorse Harris or Trump as he desires a more moderate candidate. Sergey Brin: The Google cofounder and eighth-wealthiest person in the world Brin said following the 2016 election he found Trump’s election “deeply offensive” as an immigrant, according to an internal video leaked in 2018, but has not made public any feelings during this cycle. Larry Ellison and Ken Griffin: Ellison and Griffin are perhaps the most surprising billionaires who have stayed quiet in the final months of the presidential election cycle considering both have donated millions to Republican causes in the past. Griffin (Citadel) confirmed Thursday he has not financially backed Trump, adding he’s “torn” and won’t vote with a “smile on my face” as both candidates aren’t “going to receive an award for the quality of their policies” or “the quality of their leadership.” Ellison (Oracle), the second-richest person on earth, had backed Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), while Griffin, the 39th-wealthiest, had been a Gov. Nikki Haley (R-S.C.) supporter. A total of 81 billionaires (or more) are backing Harris. Forbes identified these 28 billionaires who donated $1 million toward groups supporting Harris through August: Michael Bloomberg, left, and Harris appear together in 2023. The following 36 billionaires made between $50,000 and $999,999 in donations to groups supporting Harris through August, according to Forbes’ analysis of FEC data: Bloomberg reported these additional four billionaires have donated to Harris’ election funds or groups supporting Harris’ election: These six billionaires signed a Sept. 6 open letter supporting Harris: UPDATE (Oct. 16): And these three billionaires donated to a Harris committee during the third quarter, according to FEC filings analyzed by The New York Times: And there's music stars Bruce Springsteen, who backed Harris Oct. 3, and Taylor Swift, who endorsed Harris Sept. 10. A total of 51 billionaires have been identified as Trump backers. Forbes identified in August these 26 billionaires who had donated at least $1 million toward Trump election efforts: Musk, right, jumps on stage as he joins Trump at a Saturday rally. Another 16 billionaires gave between $50,000 and $999,999 to groups supporting Trump through that period: UPDATE (Oct. 16): The New York Times named the following three billionaires as donating at least $100,000 to Trump groups last quarter: And of course there’s Elon Musk (Tesla and SpaceX CEO), who gave $75 million last quarter to his pro-Trump America PAC, according to filings released Tuesday. Other known Trump supporters include Jeff Hildebrand (Hilcorp), Isaac Perlmutter (Marvel Entertainment), Thomas Peterffy (Interactive Brokers) and Gary Rollins (Rollins Inc.), according to media reports and Bloomberg’s analysis of public election records last month. UPDATE (Oct. 22): This article was updated to include Dimon’s reported private backing of Harris, Gates’ reported donation to Harris and Ballmer’s comments on political spending. In addition, the New Yorker recently reported activist investor Nelson Peltz hosted a February fundraiser for Trump, where Peltz reportedly quipped Trump is “a terrible human being, but our country’s in a bad place, and we can’t afford Joe Biden.” Peltz has not made public comment since Biden ceded way to Harris, and his Trian Partners asset manager did not return a request for comment. A pair of other Wall Street billionaires have said the stock market is heavily leaning toward Trump in Daniel Loeb and Stanley Druckenmiller, though neither have publicly endorsed or made major donations toward a candidate. Fellow hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman told Fox Business he doesn’t plan to vote for either major candidate. Kyle Khan-Mullins and Leo Kalmin contributed reporting. One Community. Many Voices.

(Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Last week’s oil-price drop has set us up to buy some top-flight energy dividends on the cheap. We’re going to grab one with a “hidden” 10.3% yield in just a moment. First, this buy window goes well beyond a dip in the price of the goo. Fact is, oil dropped because things calmed (slightly) in the Middle East. But of course, that can change again, and quickly. The real oil story for us is that the drop (along with a double-digit decline in natural-gas prices since the start of October) is happening as energy demand is set to rise. So desperate is the need for energy these days that Big Tech is turning to long-shuttered nuclear reactors. Microsoft (MSFT), for example, recently signed a deal with Constellation Energy (CEG) to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island—site of America’s worst nuclear accident, in 1979—to generate the power needed to satisfy AI’s voracious appetite. Meantime, I continue to believe that a “no-landing” setup is increasingly likely here in the US, in which the economy keeps humming along but inflation comes back. Not great, I know. But the fact is, when the Fed hikes rates, it usually does so until it breaks something—the main example being Paul Volcker, who was so determined to break inflation’s back that under his watch, the federal funds rate hit 22% (!). Inflation was crushed, but the hike sent the US into a deep recession, with unemployment soaring to 11% in 1982. Jay? He “broke” a couple marginal banks that were circling the drain anyway. But that was enough to cause him to blink and pump liquidity into the system through the “back door” while continuing to talk tough on rates, as this chart of bank reserves clearly shows: Liquidity Meantime, as we’ve written about previously, government deficit spending is completely out of control. It is possible, perhaps probable, that Uncle Sam will overwhelm Powell. For fiscal 2024, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a $1.9 trillion deficit on $4.9 trillion in tax receipts. (And yes, this is the CBO that paints its projections with rose-colored ink.) So we have nearly $5 trillion in revenues and almost $7 trillion in expenditures. A 40% overshoot. That $2 trillion is a big reason why the economy remains strong (the latest evidence: last week’s better-than-expected retail sales report and lower than expected jobless claims). But the resulting monetary inflation could flow back into consumer price inflation. Then there’s China, which joined the stimulus party a few weeks back, when its central bank rolled out a sweeping set of stimulus measures. The PBoC lowered interest rates (including mortgage rates) and announced “stock market support” plans to help companies buy back their own shares and to allow investors to borrow against their portfolios. Shares of Chinese firms, as well as resources like copper, popped. And while it will take a while for the PBoC’s moves to work through the economy, they’ll likely boost energy demand, too. This is a perfect setup for refiners like Phillips 66 (PSX), since they’re paying less for their main raw material (oil) these days, while demand for their finished products (gasoline, diesel and home-heating oil among them) look set to gain. Investors often misunderstand refiners, confusing them with oil and gas producers. And when they do bother to pay attention to these stocks, it’s usually in the spring, ahead of the summer driving season. (PSX has some 7,260 gas stations in the US and 1,670 outside America’s borders.) That’s too bad for the mainstream crowd, because they’re missing a window on a stock that’s sent its payout up a stout 130% over the last decade, with the only pause coming during the pandemic dumpster fire: PSX Dividend Magnet As you can see, the firm’s share price has struggled to keep up with the surging payout. But I expect that gap to close as PSX’s Dividend Magnet (or the tendency for share prices to track payouts over time) kicks in. Moreover, while we collect that payout, and get ready for more hikes, seasonal demand will swing back PSX’s way as we move through the colder months. The kicker here is that management is all-in when it comes to rewarding shareholders. In addition to its strong payout growth, Phillips 66 is a big repurchaser of its stock—having taken some 23% of its outstanding shares off the market in the last decade. That matters because those buybacks make per-share indicators like earnings per share, free cash flow per share and dividends per share look better. That supports share prices. That tees up the last thing I want to talk to you about today: shareholder yield. Wait, shareholder what? We know from the free screeners out there that PSX’s current dividend yield is around 3.5%. Simple, right? But shareholder yield goes further and includes the value of dividends and buybacks to us. To calculate it, we take the amount spent on buybacks over the last 12 months, minus any cash brought in through share issuances, plus the amount spent on dividends. We then divide the total by PSX’s market cap, or the value of all its outstanding shares. For PSX, the difference between the dividend yield and shareholder yield is dramatic: For the 12 months ended June 30, PSX spent $1.855 billion on dividends and a whopping $3.909 billion on buybacks, with $175 million in share issuances, which we’ll go ahead and subtract. Divide the $4.014-billion total by PSX’s $55.71-billion market cap (as of this writing) and you get a sweet 10.3% shareholder yield. PSX’s shareholder-friendliness is another reason why I see investors moving to this stock, especially as interest rates fall and economic growth—and energy demand—rise.

Building a Bond Ladder Barry Ritholtz: Over the past decade, or maybe even longer, No one’s accurately predicted which way rates were going. Are they going to rise? Are they going to fall? Are they going to stay steady? This creates a challenge for bond investors who are usually looking for a predictable income stream from their fixed-income holdings. One solution? Create a ladder of bonds of different maturity rates so that regardless of what occurs, you have a predictable yield series. You can lock in higher-yielding paper if rates fall, but you also free up more capital on an annual basis if rates rise, I’m Barry Ritholtz. And on today’s edition of at the money, we’re going to show you how to create a bond ladder. To help us unpack all of this and what it means for your fixed income portfolio, let’s bring in Karen Veraa. She is head of iShares US fixed income strategy for investing giant black rock. So let’s start simply by What is a bond ladder? Karen Verra: A bond ladder is a simple tool for investing in the bond market. You take your investing window, let’s say 10 years, and you equally wait every maturity across that 10 year period. So you’ve got bonds that mature in one year, two year, three years, and so on. It’s a very popular strategy because as you just mentioned, Barry, you, you don’t have to make bets on interest rate risk. You kind of have your investing horizon and you’ve got this more predictable stream of income as well as maturity is coming due each year where you can make a decision about. Going in the next rung on the bond ladder or doing something else with that money. Barry Ritholtz: We always seem to divide bond ladders into each rung is the same equity amount. What, what’s the thinking there? Karen Verra: We do see that as being the most popular. It’s because you can think through that. I’m going to have a certain amount of money. Let’s say I’ve got a hundred thousand dollars to invest and it’s a 10 year-ladder. I’ve got 10, 000 coming due each year. You can kind of think of it in chunks like that. We do see some people, who are laddering out amounts and retirement accounts, and they need to take those required minimum distributions where they will look at the IRS schedule of how much they have to pull out of the account. It’s not quite equal, but you can even ladder out those required minimum distributions. Um, you know, it’s about 8 percent instead of 10 percent in the first year, for example. And then you don’t have to sell anything inside your retirement account and you can just pull those out on schedule. So that’s another way that people weight their bond ladders when they’re seeking that goal of having those RMDs coming due every year. Barry Ritholtz: Let’s talk about what goes into bond ladders. I’m assuming a mix of US Treasury bonds, munis, investment grade corporates, even high yielding. Anything else go into the mix for bond ladders? Karen Verra: I’d say the most popular tends to be munis and corporate bonds and the investment grade side. We offer a suite of exchange traded funds that mature each year and they’re primarily used to build bond ladders. We have these in high yield as well for people who want to go out and add a little bit more income and credit risk to the portfolios. We even have them in the tips market. So these days you can build a bond ladder using all these different asset classes. I think some of the challenges with CDs is typically they’re limited in their term. They may only go out up to five years and sometimes the banks will have restrictions or penalties if you want to sell them early or try to get your money back early. So we’ve seen people migrate away from CD ladders, doing it more with bond and bond ETFs to build these ladders. Barry Ritholtz: How do investors determine what their timeline is? I think that’s a pretty interesting choice and most people just seem to assume it’s 10 years, but from what I’ve seen, there are a variety of timelines. Karen Verra: I think people can think about it if they have a liability that they’re managing to or a time based goal. Uh, we see people sometimes building ladders, let’s say three to seven years because maybe they have a cash portfolio for things the next couple of years, but then they don’t want to start their ladder out for a few years. One to five tends to be the most popular, um, based on data that we have around assets and those different account types. We rarely see people go out past 10 years. I do see people asking for 15 because I think with the bond ladder, you can accomplish most of your goals within that time horizon of having stability, having income, rolling it every year. We also see on the corporate side, corporate issues will issue 10-year bonds and they might do a 30-year bond, but there’s not really that much paper that’s actively being issued beyond 10 years. So what tends to happen is there’s just not that many new issues and it’s hard to find the bonds. So I think that’s another reason why that 10 year point tends to be the maximum for most people’s ladders. Barry Ritholtz: We never know what yields will be in the future. How can an investor lock in the best yields on the duration curve today and benefit over the next decade with their ladders? Karen Verra: Well, we do have an inverted yield curve right now. So we’ve seen a lot of people overweighting their ladders in that one to two year bucket trying to maximize income. Maybe they do might do an extra, you know, 40, 50 percent than what they would usually do. But I think one of the nice things you can do now is. Try to lock in the yields for the interim. We’ve been telling people on the corporate side, you can get about 5 percent by continuing to go out, 6 to 7 percent for high yield. And so we’re seeing people who are doing that right now, knowing that when the fed starts to cut rates, interest rates are going to come down and they want to put some of that cash to work and consistently be getting four, five, six percent, rather than have it dissipate, um, in those short term vehicles as soon as interest rates go down. Barry Ritholtz: I continue to see people who are waiting for inflation to re-accelerate. They’re warning that the Fed is, is looking at this incorrectly and that we should be expecting much higher yields. If that were to happen, didn’t someone who just set up a bond ladder lock in low rates or how does the ladder work in the face of that? Karen Verra: So when I think about the ladder, it’s going to be a more known investment result than some other more perpetual bond strategies. So you kind of know what your yield is going to be over that period. You can do a few things. You could use TIPs. So we have for example, tips, term maturity, ETFs, tips I bonds where you, you can get protected for the inflation. But you also have the periodic income payments kicking off the ladder that you can reinvest at higher yields, which will add income over time. And you also have that discrete point when something matures this year, you can go and grab more income. So what we see is as yields go up, you’re slowly walking that ladder up and, and recouping more of the income over time. Barry Ritholtz: What about the opposite group of prognosticators, the ones who have been forecasting a recession every year for the past three years that just hasn’t shown up? If there’s a recession and rates fall pretty radically, what happens then? What’s our reinvestment risk there? Karen Verra: So if you’ve got your ladder locked in at today’s yields and yields come down, that ladder income stream is worth more. So we’ll actually see the prices on the bonds go up in that situation. But then you’re right. When the money comes to, you’re going to be reinvesting at lower rates. And then over time that will, will get go down a bit. If you are worried about a recession, I would say, go up in quality, stick to treasuries, investment grade, the higher quality, even munis, the higher quality asset classes that you don’t have to worry about as much default risk and volatility if we do have a coming recession. Barry Ritholtz: I know you’re the strategist for iShares, which issues a lot of ETFs. When I first started in the 1990s, bond ladders were all individually owned papers and separately managed accounts. Everything was hand-selected. The minimums were pretty high. The cost structure was pretty high. The state of the art stayed that way for decades. It seems to have gotten a whole lot better, cheaper, faster, easier today. Tell us, what is the state of the art building a bond ladder using ETFs? Karen Verra: I think this is one of the innovations that has really come about in the last decade. No longer do you have to have a million dollars to create a bespoke bond ladder with an SMA manager. You can do it today for very little amounts of money. And so what we’ve seen is our I bonds have been popular inside smaller account sizes. If you’ve got, you know, a one-off account over here, or even if you have a lot of money, it’s just a very efficient way to do that. So our I bonds ETFs are term maturity ETFs. They have a maturity date, typically each December and they’re holding bonds that mature throughout the calendar year. And then when the last bond matures, The ETF will delist from the exchange and you’ll have cash hitting your account, just like a bond maturity. And we’ve got them now in treasuries, tips, munis investment grade and high yield. So five different sectors of the bond market. And then we’ve seen people really customize things for their income needs for their tax status. And they’re, they’re getting exposed to hundreds of bonds in a single ETF, as opposed to what we see with a lot of SMAs – is they might be limited to maybe 20 to 30 bonds at the most. So you’re getting diversification at a very low cost. And because they are exchange traded, if you change your mind and want to sell them, you can at any point where a lot of times with a bond, it’s really easy to buy it, but then maybe when you go to sell it, it’s hard to find a buyer or there’s large transaction costs associated with that. Barry Ritholtz: So I’m hearing diversification, lower costs, liquidity, you mentioned they all, the ETF will mature at the end of the year, so you have a defined maturity, obviously no callable bonds go into that. But it seems working with an ETF gives you – I’m doing a little bit of a commercial here, but my firm uses a lot of ETFs, we’re very happy with them, you get a lot of flexibility and professional management – this really seems to be much better than the bad old days when someone was handpicking dozens of individual bonds. Karen Verra: We still see people who are preferring that, let’s say you have special, you’re in a high-tech state and you want a special SMA dedicated to that. So we see people even using our iBonds alongside SMAs or alongside other strategies. Or maybe they’re whittling those down. Like we don’t tell people go out and sell your bond portfolio. You’re curated over decades. However, this is a great strategy, I think, to provide some liquidity, diversification, and low cost access to these different parts of the bond market. Barry Ritholtz: One of the advantages of working with various large firms like yourself, iShares, Fidelity, Schwab, whoever. You have a variety of online tools to build your own bond ladder. Tell us a little bit about what people can find if they want to just do it themselves. Karen Verra: If you go to iShares.com backslash iBonds, you’ll find our landing page and there’s a link to our iBonds ladder tool. And we designed this to be just like a report that you would get if you went to a bond manager and asked for a bond ladder, you can input your dollar amount, you can check the box on which sectors of the bond market you want to be invested in, and there’s even a slider where you can look at your maturities. And right away, it will give you an equal-weighted ladder. You can then customize that ladder. If you’d like, you can delete things you don’t want, and it will have some summary characteristics, the number of bonds, the duration, the yield, the cost, and I think it’s a, it’s a great way to just visualize those yields. Like we have people who will come in and they want to know what different Maturities of the bond market are yielding. They can go in and look in, see where the treasury curve is, the investment grade curve, the high yield curve. And I think it’s just a great source of information to even go in and see what the different parts of the market are yielding. Barry Ritholtz: So to sum up, investors that are looking for yield but are concerned about interest rates going up, down, and all over the place can solve for that problem by creating a ladder of bond ETFs, spreading it out over five to 10 years. So their interest rate risk is reduced. They’re locking in rates now and if rates go higher as things mature, they can reinvest it. And if rates go down, hey, well, at least you locked in a higher rate for the first half of that, um, of those investments. It seems to make a lot of sense and especially if you’re working towards a specific liability or a specific goal, uh, where you have an obligation down the road, this allows you with very little risk to hit those targets. Karen Verra: That’s right. We, we’re seeing. all kinds of investors using them for, for different goals and objectives, different, different terms. And I think it really empowers people to do it themselves and invest in the bond market. Barry Ritholtz: Thank you, Karen. This has been really interesting. I’m Barry Ritholtz.

getty Explore stock market predictions for 2025 and what may be coming next year. Learn key trends, forecasts, and insights to help guide your investment decisions. (search description) So far, 2024 is shaping up to be a strong year for stocks. With interest rates expected to fall further, it's easy to assume next year could be another win for equity investors—if only the financial markets were that simple. In reality, there are real risks and uncertainties in play for 2025. While many analysts expect the year to be positive for stocks, several factors could introduce volatility along the way. Prepare yourself for what may lie ahead with this expert-informed overview of risks, sectors to watch and S&P 500 predictions for next year. Through mid-October, the S&P 500 is up 22.5% year to date. The growth followed last year's gain of 24%. 2022 was less profitable. In that year, the S&P 500 fell nearly 20%. You may remember that 2022 was the year the Fed began raising interest rates to combat inflation. Those moves raised bond yields, encouraging investors to shift away from stocks in favor of debt securities. This rise-and-fall cycle is typical for the U.S. stock market and economy. The good times typically last longer, but weaker financial markets and economies can be more traumatic—emotionally and financially. The thing to remember is that no stock market climate is permanent. Whether stock prices are heading up or down, there is always a reversal ahead. Keeping that in mind can help you manage whatever's in store for 2025 and beyond.

Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days Pundits are largely optimistic about the U.S. financial markets in 2025, but with a good dose of caution. Global financial markets are more intertwined today than ever, which makes U.S. stocks more sensitive to a broader range of factors. Five factors to watch in 2025 are the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, domestic inflation and interest rates, technology innovation, global economic trends and rising geopolitical tensions. I expand on each of these factors below. Justin Zacks, vice president of strategy at Moomoo Technologies, and Michael Martin, vice president of market strategy at TradingBlock, expect the 2024 presidential election to have a major influence on the stock market next year. Zacks believes the first 100 days of either president's term will set the tone for the next four years. Martin points to the U.S. tariff policy and the national deficit as hot-button issues for the next president. New tariffs could slow the U.S. economy, Martin explains, which in turn could cause inflation worries to linger into 2026 and beyond. The deficit, unchecked, could contribute to the continued devaluation of the U.S. dollar. A breakdown of trust in the U.S. dollar could push investors to "alternative stores of value like gold and bitcoin," according to Martin. The Fed lowered interest rates in September after inflation finally dipped below 3% over the summer. Many analysts expect the Fed to continue cutting rates in small increments as inflation drops softly down to 2%. Unfortunately there are risks to this plan. Zacks believes there is a possibility we'll see stagflation next year, for example. Stagflation is persistent inflation despite a softening economy and labor market. He cites changing tariff policies and geopolitical tensions as potential catalysts. Martin questions whether the Fed's 2% inflation target is realistic. If it's not and rates remain higher as a new normal, profit margins could suffer. Broadly lower profitability will stifle stock market growth. Technological innovation has recently been a primary growth driver for the stock market, creating some of the best stocks of 2024. As an example, semiconductor company Nvidia (NVDA) has increased its stock price by 178% by decisively monetizing demand for high-performance computing resources. Nvidia's graphics processing units are a preferred resource for machine learning workloads. For better or worse, the stock market will respond to further developments in artificial intelligence in 2025. One uncertainty is whether AI can deliver on its promises of efficiency and productivity. Billions are being spent on AI development and the return expectations are high. Many experts believe AI will prove itself, fueling higher earnings expectations and, in turn, higher stock prices. Angelina Hu, global head of investor relations at SALT Venture Group, cites ongoing economic slowness in China as a potential limitation for stock market growth in 2025. A sluggish Chinese economy weakens demand for U.S. exports. China's finance ministry has announced plans for a stimulus package, but the details of that program are still unknown. Companies with significant exposure to China may experience volatility as the stimulus plans take shape. Thus far, the war in Ukraine and rising conflict in the Middle East have not created major problems in the U.S. financial markets. This could change if unrest escalates to the point of disrupting global trade or commodities supply, according to Zacks. Another concern is the engagement of U.S. troops on foreign soil, which would likely sour investor sentiment and take a toll on stock prices in the process.

For added context, see this list of the best investing sectors for 2024. Market intelligence company IDC expects worldwide spending on AI to more than double between 2024 and 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29%. The investments will go towards AI-enabled applications, hardware, including semiconductors, storage systems and servers, plus related services such as cloud computing. McKinsey has predicted healthcare profits will grow at a 7% CAGR between 2022 and 2027. Expected profit drivers after 2024 include cost efficiencies and higher reimbursement rates. Industry-wide margin expansion will be supported by greater use of health services and technology (HST) firms. HST firms help insurance companies, health systems and life-sciences companies identify revenue opportunities and cut costs with data and analytics. This is expected to be a fast-growing segment within healthcare. With a growing tech sector comes higher energy demands. For context, Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) has estimated that AI chatbots like ChatGPT use 10 times the electricity of an internet search. In 2023, fossil fuels accounted for 60% of U.S. electricity generation, while renewable energy sources provided 21%. Fossil fuels will continue to play an important role in the energy ecosystem in the near term. Renewable solar, wind and hydro power will also see greater demand, particularly from data centers and technology companies. Expert predictions for stock market growth in 2025 vary from a 5% decline to growth of 20%. Many pundits are pegging a 10% increase as the most likely scenario. Richard McWhorter, managing partner of Private Wealth Advisor, predicts a range of -5% to 5%, for example. McWhorter cites the elevated multiple of the S&P 500 as a primary factor. He believes earnings must grow into that multiple before the market can deliver double-digit growth. Ed Mahaffy, president and senior portfolio manager at ClientFirst Wealth, Legacy & Estate Planning, has a more bullish outlook. Citing ongoing innovation in AI and falling interest rates, Mahaffy expects the S&P 500 will end 2025 up 14.5% to 19.6%. Michael Ashley Schulman, partner and chief investment officer for Running Point Capital Advisors, holds a midrange view. Schulman believes the S&P 500 will grow 7% to 11% next year, with volatility along the way. He notes economic growth, earnings expansion, rising mergers and acquisitions activity and lower interest rates as influential factors. As of October, the S&P 500 is hovering around 5,850. If the index declines 5% in 2025, it will end the year at about 5,557. If the index grows 20% next year, it will end the year at about 7,000. Ten percent growth equates to a year-end value of 6,435. Volatility will be a primary challenge for investors in 2025. Uncertainty about the factors noted above, from the outcome of the U.S. election to foreign conflicts, almost ensure the market will have good days and bad ones. High valuations could exacerbate the ups and downs as investors oscillate between fear and greed. Zacks notes that the 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is well above its 20-year average. Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) are major contributors. For context, see this prediction for Tesla stock in 2025. "Companies' earnings will need to continue to grow to justify such valuations," Zacks explains. If earnings come in weaker than expected—for any reason—2025 could be a rough year. Considering the uncertainties at hand, how should you prep your portfolio for next year? Two areas that may warrant adjustments are the composition of your income portfolio and your sector exposures. If you have adjusted your income holdings to favor high-yield cash deposits and bonds in recent years, it may be time to unwind those changes. As interest rates fall, cash deposits will drop, too—making dividend yields look relatively more attractive. Dividend stocks have the additional appeal of having relatively low volatility. These can offer downside protection if the market does get rocky. Sector adjustments can help you capitalize if the Fed continues lowering interest rates. Capital-intensive sectors like technology and industrials tend to get a lift when rates fall. Consumer discretionary stocks will also benefit if cheaper debt encourages spending growth. More consumers may, for example, splurge on luxury vacations or new cars if these can be financed affordably. Banks and consumer staples stocks, on the other hand, are less attractive in lower-rate environments. Banks can see their margins shrink when rates fall, while consumer staples companies can be less popular with investors in growth economies. The prevailing outlook for 2025 is cautious optimism. Momentum in technology innovation and lower interest rates are generally good for the stock market, but high valuations, global tensions and uncertainty around the U.S. presidential election could pose risks. Now may be the time to diversify across growth and value. Blended exposure offers gain potential plus volatility protection—the best of both worlds. The technology, healthcare and energy sectors are predicted to perform well in 2025. If inflation remains low, the Fed will continue reducing interest rates. Falling interest rates usually have a positive impact on stock prices. Lingering high inflation would sour investor sentiment and put downward pressure on stock prices. Growth stocks and value stocks can play a role in 2025. Many experts believe the stock market will be up next year, albeit with volatility. Growth stocks can provide appreciation potential, while value stocks can offer stability in turbulent times. Lingering inflation and disappointing corporate earnings are the biggest risks the stock market will face in 2025.

Title: Is The Future Of BCI Right Under Our Nose?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/naveenrao/2024/10/23/is-the-future-of-bci-right-under-our-nose/
Time Published: 2024-10-23T15:00:00Z

Neurotech startup Augmental has raised a $4m seed round to commercialize their wearable interface for people living with motor impairment and limited hand function. The “MouthPad” offers an unprecedented and convenient alternative to a brain-computer interface, or BCI, that circumvents the need for brain surgery by enabling users to control a mouse cursor using their tongue, breaths, head gestures, and soon, voice. Augmental's MouthPad, a new kind of interface that enables hands-free control of digital devices. It’s the brainchild of two engineers, Tomás Vega and Corten Singer, who met as undergraduates at Berkeley and reunited in Cambridge to found the company at the tail end of Vega’s graduate work at MIT in 2019. Over the pandemic, they formed Augmental and relocated to San Francisco, where they recently upgraded their garage-based R&D hub for a new office space that includes a clean room for commercial-grade manufacturing and distribution. The novel form factor belies Augmental’s importance to the future of neurotech markets. Their progress over the coming years represents a crystal ball for the success or failure of companies like Neuralink, Synchron, and many others in the crowded field of implantable BCI. To understand why, let’s look at product functionality, the state of the market, and the growing, global commercial ecosystem in BCI. Augmental operates under a banner known as “Assistive Technologies.” AT includes tools to help with typing, speech, smart home functionality, as well as wheelchairs, semi autonomous robots, prosthetic or robotic limbs and some stimulation devices. Estimates vary but analysts have pegged this at a $20 billion annual market opportunity that is growing quickly as our technophile society ages. New Mobility recently published a close-up on several AT tools, and included both the MouthPad and its early impact on end user Keely Horch, a 19 year old living with quadriplegia. From the article: “The MouthPad embeds a tiny touchpad in a dental-safe resin retainer, Bluetooth-enabled, for the tongue to manipulate like a finger would. At first it was a challenge grasping the relationship between tongue, touchpad and screen, but now Horch forgets the device is even in her mouth and uses it for five hours a day, controlling her cell phone and more easily editing the papers she dictates with voice recognition, which works alongside the MouthPad without a hitch. Settings are customizable, and she right-clicks by drawing air through her lips: It’s sip-and-puff without the straw.” Each MouthPad is custom-printed based on dental scans from a national network of over 90 partnered centers across the US. Augmental’s operation is becoming scalable now, after three years of working closely with nearly 100 people living with various disabilities such as spinal cord injury and neuromuscular disorders to design and develop a product that works intuitively. Investors backing the vision include SCI Ventures, Murata, Revere Partners, LivEdge Capital, Fen, Carao and Tesserakt, as well as individuals from Andreseen Horowitz’s Scout Fund and a group of Angel Investors that include notable consumer electronics experts such as Eric Migicovsky and Nirav Patel, as well as Neuralink’s Head of Next Gen, Joey O’Doherty. Horch, an engineering sophomore in college, uses the MouthPad to play games with her brothers and participate in class, stating, “I was able to unmute myself and raise my hand and type questions up…I was able to use different software, like graphing, and it was really helpful for visualizing things.” Analysts are confident that BCI will be a $400 billion market in 20 years, but they can’t measure how much digital autonomy is worth today for people who can’t move their hands. Augmental’s users who can move their head and neck can use head-tracking for cursor control, and perform clicks and other gestures with tongue movements. Those with more limited mobility can use tongue gestures alone for cursor control, clicks, swipes, etc. How does the Mouthpad compare to implanted BCI? With a pricepoint in the low four figures (currently $1,500 through the company’s early-access program) it is a magnitude of order more affordable than the estimated range of $30,000 to $60,000 for implanted BCI. Moreover, by circumventing surgery of any sort, users avoid possible complications, from infections to difficulties upgrading the device. Critically, the functionality is comparable. Vega shared that their “Bits Per Second” test, which is one technical measure of controlling a mouse cursor with BCI, clocks in at 7.85 BPS for their top-performing quadriplegic user. Compare this to 9.51, which was Neuralink user Noland Arbaugh’s top score at the time of this writing. Most importantly, the device is available for use today. 2024 represents a breakout year for Augmental. In addition to their seed round and new office, they have crossed $100k in direct sales, published user testimonials and brought on world-class engineers and experts to expand the range of actions available to MouthPad users, including building a voice-based UI for whisper speech, and eventually fully silent speech. Moving forward, the question is not whether the MouthPad is capable of helping people. It’s how Augmental can scale growth until qualifying their device for insurance reimbursement, which would expand access to hundreds or thousands of people seeking greater digital autonomy. The complexity of delivering affordable innovations into “the disability market” cannot be understated. As Augmental navigates the broken roads experienced by people living with serious motor impairment, they’ve entered the cottage industry of AT. Finding Reimbursement for novel devices involves a whack-a-mole quest through departments of rehabilitation, vocational programs, state Medicaid offices, county level disability support offices, and the like. Despite the challenges, the number of Mouthpad users has grown to 50, with as many devices in production. MouthPad users live across 28 states, and the waitlist for the device has surpassed 3,000 people. In the background, the company is pursuing a submission to the FDA for virtual control of electronic wheelchairs, which would qualify them for CMS reimbursement down the road. Meanwhile they are helping candidates access grant funding to pay for MouthPads and have forged alliances with nonprofits to promote and sponsor device purchase. Augmental is planning an in-house team to develop and cultivate relationships with these key institutions to broaden onramps to access by meeting patients in existing communities nationwide. One such nonprofit is BCI Pioneer Ian Burkhart’s foundation, which has sponsored a handful of MouthPads for users in Ohio. In April, Burkhart, who was implanted with a research version of Blackrock’s interface in a clinical trial that ran from 2014 to 2021, shared his experience of navigating health coverage and income caps for disability programs with The Atlantic: “The salary (an end-user would) have to make to cover both expenses and in-home care out of pocket, though, is much more than most jobs pay. A lot of people don’t have the opportunity to make such a giant leap. The system is set up to force you to live in poverty.” An affordable, risk-free BCI could change the conversation around value and productivity. What if enabling success in the classroom or the workplace is comparable to the cost of a new phone, rather than a new car? For now, philanthropy represents a stop-gap to drive access. It makes sense then, that SCI Ventures, born from the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation and operating as a strategic venture philanthropy, led Augmental’s seed round. In a conversation with me this summer, SCI Venture’s Managing Partner Adrien Cohen described Augmental’s approach as “extremely elegant,” adding “I’ve seen the impact it’s had on users' autonomy and independence. In a few minutes, you’re controlling your laptop, using your phone without assistance, without a caretaker. It’s a mindblowing innovation that needs to exist in the world.” The challenging opportunities facing Vega, Singer, and their team of ten engineers and designers could reveal several promising paths for Augmental in the coming months: What’s in it for the BCI companies? It comes down to competitive strategy. In a recent article, Burkhart, Jen French, and colleagues discuss the opportunities and gaps in building Assistive Technology. These include co-development of products and standards designed with end-users in mind. Beyond calling for tech companies to do the right thing by engaging people with lived experiences (including those who might not be eligible for implantation), they call for closer consideration of how inclusive design could attract cause-driven funders and improve adoption of frontier technologies, while facilitating scale-up through crowdsourcing. There are many BCI companies emerging, but few functional wearable control interfaces out there, ready to use and scale today. So, where can commercial leaders and investors find a revenue-generating, low-risk market opportunity to help people living with disability today, while generating unique insights on user preferences, habits, requirements, limitations, and ideas that could differentiate BCI roadmaps and strategy?

Title: Bitcoin Going to $200K by 2025 Is a ‘Conservative’ Estimate, Says Global Asset Manager Bernstein

Analysts at Bernstein, a leading research and brokerage firm that is a subsidiary of global investment firm AllianceBernstein (AB), have reportedly described their Bitcoin price prediction of $200,000 by the end of 2025 as “conservative.” They urged those skeptical about cryptocurrency to reconsider its potential, particularly given the rising U.S. debt levels. According to a report by James Hunt for The Block, Gautam Chhugani, who leads Bernstein’s digital assets division, sent a note to clients on Wednesday stating, “Bitcoin is on track to reach $200,000 by the end of this cycle, projected for 2025. We consider this a conservative estimate.” The forecast follows the recent release of Bernstein’s “Bitcoin Blackbook,” which is aimed at guiding institutional investors interested in the cryptocurrency. Legendary Research Broker Bernstein Has Just Published One of its Famed "Black Books" on #Bitcoin!160 Pages Explaining Why BTC Will Hit $200k by the end of 2025 and How Listed #Bitcoin Miners Will Continue to Consolidate the Industry. @gautamchhugani 👏 pic.twitter.com/lDnAvWeYIe Chhugani pointed out that, in a world where the U.S. national debt now stands at $35 trillion and inflationary risks persist, Bitcoin’s scarcity as a digital asset offers strong appeal as a “store of value.” He added that those who view gold as a solid investment should find Bitcoin an even more compelling option. For investors looking for indirect exposure to Bitcoin, Chhugani suggested considering companies like MicroStrategy, which holds the largest amount of Bitcoin on its corporate balance sheet, and Robinhood, which is growing its crypto offerings. Chhugani also pointed to the potential of U.S.-based firms such as Riot Platforms and CleanSpark, which are amassing significant energy capacity for Bitcoin mining. He noted that Core Scientific is leveraging its resources for both AI hosting services and Bitcoin mining, tapping into the growing demand for AI infrastructure. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $66,349, down 0.7% in the past 24-hour period. The BTC price is down 9.5% from its all-time high of around 10% from an all-time high of roughly $73,737 set on 14 March 2024, but up 58.31% in the year-to-date period. On October 16, Real Vision’s Chief Crypto Analyst Jamie Coutts presented a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, citing the increasing backing from institutional investors. Coutts highlighted a notable change in asset allocation preferences, driven by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s public support for Bitcoin. He pointed out that BlackRock’s Aladdin platform, widely used by sovereign wealth funds and major asset managers for portfolio modeling, now integrates Bitcoin seamlessly via its ETF. This, Coutts argued, has cleared the way for Bitcoin’s price to rise significantly. He predicted that even a small reallocation of institutional investments from traditional assets like sovereign bonds to Bitcoin could see BTC surpass $500,000 by the end of the decade. With #crypto bro Fink endorsing #Bitcoin's portfolio-enhancing qualities, a seismic shift in asset allocation preferences is underway. @BlackRock's Aladdin platform, utilized by the largest sovereigns and money managers, provides the tools for modelling and attribution while… https://t.co/gxaxwBRdTP pic.twitter.com/FeNKnggUuf Featured Image via Pixabay The views and opinions expressed by the author, or any people mentioned in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.

Good morning! Add this to the list of things that might scare you about artificial intelligence: losing your home. Real-estate scammers are using AI tools to commit deed theft, with the owner of a $137.5 million mansion saying they're among the victims. In today's big story, Tesla reports earnings this afternoon with the focus back on its cars business. What's on deck: But first, back to basics. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Tesla has spent plenty of time discussing the future, but Wall Street wants to bring the EV giant back to the present. Elon Musk's company reports third-quarter earnings this afternoon, and analysts are focused on its core auto business. Business Insider's Matthew Fox has a rundown on analysts' expectations ahead of Tesla's big day. (To get real-time updates on Tesla's earnings, be sure to check out our live blog here.) Musk has spent time talking up everything but the cars his company currently sells. From robotaxis to autonomous vehicles and bartending bots, Tesla's earnings calls have been heavily focused on what's next instead of what's now. Tesla has good reason to avoid talking about the present. Its sales dropped for two straight quarters before righting the ship in Q3. It'll now take a massive fourth quarter for its 2024 sales to eclipse last year's figure. Touting robotaxis and pitching the company as a leader in artificial intelligence has eased the pain (and helped the stock price), but even that has its limit. Tesla's share price is still down more than 12% year-to-date after its flashy robotaxi event mostly fell flat with investors. That's why all eyes are back on its core business of selling cars, including the status of its industry-leading profit margins. The report could signal the worst is behind Tesla … or is yet to come. Tesla also needs to worry about what's in its rearview mirror. General Motors' third-quarter earnings report topped estimates, leading to a nearly 10% surge in its stock. Part of its success included improved EV growth and profitability, writes BI's Benjamin Zhang. GM now holds a 9.8% share of the US market, trailing only Tesla. That comes during what's been an overall tough time for the EV market. (But a good time for any who's in the market for one!) While the industry continues to grow, it's at a much slower pace than a few years ago. Automakers have been forced to readjust their strategy around breaking into the market. Overseas, things aren't much better for Tesla. China, the world's largest auto market and an area of growth for Tesla, has gotten increasingly competitive. Domestic rivals recently posted a record month for sales, and China's EV giants stole the show at Europe's largest auto show.

Title: Nvidia's CEO says a design flaw in its new AI chip was '100% Nvidia's fault'

Nvidia (NVDA+0.52%) says it has fixed a design flaw in its latest artificial intelligence chips that led to production and shipping delays. The chipmaker worked with its partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-1.46%), to resolve the engineering setback in its highly anticipated Blackwell AI platform. “It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,” Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said, according to Reuters. “It was 100% Nvidia’s fault.” The complexity of the project contributed to the setback. The Blackwell computer involved seven new chip designs that needed to be developed and put into production simultaneously, according to Huang. The problems first surfaced in August, when Nvidia’s stock fell around 8% after a report that Blackwell’s production was delayed due to a design flaw, possibly setting deliveries back by three or so months and impacting major customers such as Google (GOOGL-0.07%) and Microsoft (MSFT+0.03%). During the company’s second-quarter earnings that month, Huang said Nvidia shipped samples of Blackwell to customers and that the AI platform’s production would ramp up in the fourth quarter into the next fiscal year. To “improve production yield,” Nvidia made a change to Blackwell’s GPU mask, the chipmaker said during earnings. However, “there were no functional changes necessary,” Huang said on a call with analysts. The company said it expects to “ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue” in the fourth quarter. “What TSMC did, was to help us recover from that yield difficulty and resume the manufacturing of Blackwell at an incredible pace,” Huang said during an appearance in Denmark to unveil the country’s first AI supercomputer, Gefion. The recovery appears successful. In October, Nvidia shares got a boost after Huang said Blackwell was in full production and demand for the chip was “insane.” “Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first,” Huang said during an appearance on CNBC. Nvidia stock closed at a record high of $143.71 per share earlier this week ahead of major technology companies’ earnings. The chipmaker’s shares were down 3.3% during mid-day trading on Wednesday but are up around 189% so far this year.

Title: DoubleVerify stock hits 52-week low at $16.38 amid market challenges

In a challenging market environment, DoubleVerify Holdings Inc. (NYSE:DV) stock has touched a 52-week low, reaching a price level of $16.38. The company, known for its software platform that provides online media verification and campaign effectiveness solutions, has seen a significant downturn over the past year, with its stock price declining by 42.53%. This substantial drop reflects broader market trends and possibly investor concerns about the company's growth prospects amidst a competitive digital advertising landscape. The 52-week low marks a critical point for DoubleVerify as it navigates through the current economic headwinds and aims to reassure investors of its long-term value proposition. In other recent news, DoubleVerify Holdings Inc. has seen adjustments to its stock price target by several firms, including Needham, Truist Securities, and Canaccord Genuity, all of which have maintained a Buy rating. The adjustments are due to revised growth expectations, notably in the company's Measurement and Activation segments. Needham now projects DoubleVerify's FY25 revenue to be $770 million, a 15% year-over-year increase, but 6% below the previous estimate. Furthermore, DoubleVerify reported a 17% increase in Q2 revenue to $156 million, along with an 83% gross margin and $47 million in adjusted EBITDA, driven by strong performance in social and Connected TV measurement and a growing supply side platform business. The company also introduced its Inflammatory Politics and News category on Meta (NASDAQ:META), aimed at protecting advertisers from aligning with controversial content. This new feature is supported by DoubleVerify's Universal Content Intelligence, an AI-powered engine that ensures precise content categorization across the platform. In addition, DoubleVerify has established new partnerships and anticipates a positive revenue impact starting early 2025 following the closure of competing services like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)'s Moat and Grapeshot. Analysts from both Truist Securities and Canaccord Genuity expect DoubleVerify to continue outperforming its closest peer and the overall digital advertising industry. These are recent developments for DoubleVerify. DoubleVerify's recent stock performance aligns with the InvestingPro data, which shows a 45.72% price decline over the past six months. Despite this downturn, the company maintains some financial strengths. According to InvestingPro Tips, DoubleVerify holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, indicating a solid financial position. This could provide the company with flexibility to navigate the current challenging market conditions. The company also boasts impressive gross profit margins, with InvestingPro data revealing a gross profit margin of 82.18% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This high margin suggests that DoubleVerify's software platform remains cost-effective and potentially scalable, which could be crucial for future growth. However, investors should note that the stock is trading at a high P/E ratio of 47.04, significantly above market averages. This valuation metric, combined with the recent stock price decline, may indicate that the market is recalibrating expectations for the company's growth trajectory. For those seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips on DoubleVerify, providing deeper insights into the company's financial health and market position.

Title: Caelan Doris confirmed as captain as Ireland’s squad for Autumn Series is named
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/23/caelan-doris-confirmed-as-captain-as-irelands-squad-for-autumn-series-is-named/
Time Published: 2024-10-23T13:22:44Z
Full Content:
And so it has come to pass. If historians ever come to revisit Andy Farrell’s squad announcement for the 2024 Autumn Nations Series its most notable aspect will probably be the passing of the baton as captain to Caelan Doris. He was only conferred as Leinster captain last month but he already looked like a prospective Lions king. Allowing for the Peter O’Mahony interregnum for last season’s Six Nations, and a deserving promotion it was too for someone who captained Munster for a decade, Ireland rugby teams have tended to have a go-to leader for the duration of World Cup cycles. Brian O’Driscoll was the captain for the 2007 and 2011 cycles, to be followed by Paul O’Connell (2012-15), Rory Best (2016-19) and Johnny Sexton (2020-23). Now we are entering the Doris era, and at 26 who is to say for how long. But certainly up until the 2027 World Cup in the USA and potentially beyond looks probable. One always had the impression that Farrell identified Doris as captain for this cycle quicker than the player himself did, and that being the modest type he is, Doris didn’t particularly aspire to the role. Farrell’s thinking was evident from the second round of last season’s Six Nations, when he named Doris captain ahead of James Ryan in the absence of O’Mahony. His thinking is entirely understandable, for whether or not Doris becomes a great orator in time, he leads by deed and, if fit and well, is a world-class player and is one of the first names on the team sheet. Perhaps the first. Doris also has an aura or presence about him, and just because his anointment was inevitable doesn’t make it any less of a landmark. Especially so in a largely predictable reprise of the 35-man squad initially named for last summer’s two-Test tour to South Africa save for five changes, all injury related. Where Dan Sheehan was one of the three hookers then, only to be replaced by Dave Heffernan, after his ACL injury in the first Test, now the Connacht man is named alongside Rónan Kelleher and Rob Herring. Despite both being sidelined, the expectation clearly is that Herring, and at a push Kelleher, will be fit for the opening game against the All Blacks. With Oli Jager injured, the other five props are retained, while the fit-again Iain Henderson is added to the other locks. Having been ruled out of the South African tour, Jamison Gibson-Park returns at the expense of Nathan Doak. The other two changes see the return of the Mack, in the guise the fit-again Hansen, and Hugo Keenan, after his secondment to the Ireland Olympic Sevens squad. The injured Jordan Larmour and Jimmy O’Brien miss out, as does the unlucky Jack Conan. Hence Cian Prendergast and the uncapped Cormac Izuchukwu are retained, as is the former’s brother Sam, who is the only other uncapped player. Farrell has an eye for prospective Test match players, witness the unhesitating promotion of Gibson-Park to the matchday 23 even when he was ostensibly number two at Leinster, and likewise Joe McCarthy, Hansen and Jamie Osborne, not least as a fullback. Although Farrell’s thinking at outhalf appears to have influenced Leinster this season, he doesn’t tell the provinces what to do, he shows them. Perhaps in part because of the increasing logjam at Leinster given Frawley’s conversion to 10 and the emergence of Sam Prendergast in addition to Ross and Harry Byrne, it almost seemed as if this season’s Emerging Ireland tour was devised more for the younger Prendergast sibling than any other player. He started all three games, was given his head in organising the team’s attacking play and received effusive praise from the stand-in head coach Simon Easterby, who will deputise for Farrell again in the Six Nations when Ireland seek a historic three titles in a row. Given Izuchukwu was also on both the senior tour and Emerging Ireland tour to South Africa, it seems reasonable to deduce that Farrell and Easterby also admire the athletic Ulster backrower, whose emergence may have happened sooner but for injuries. It therefore also seems reasonable to speculate that both Izuchukwu and Prendergast are being earmarked for Test debuts in this window, with the third game against Fiji looking like an ideal opportunity to do so. The absence of the unlucky Jack Conan again, after he suffered a hamstring injury in Leinster’s win over Munster and the likely absence of O’Mahony, until halfway through the window, reduces Farrell’s options in the backrow. For the opening game against the All Blacks, the likelier ploy is move Tadhg Beirne to blindside in accommodating Ryan and McCarthy in the secondrow, as in the second Test win over the Springboks, or picking two from those three at lock and start Ryan Baird in the backrow. Ciarán Frawley is putting pressure on Jack Crowley, but despite his mixed start to the season with Munster he is likely to be retained alongside the returning Gibson-Park. Bundee Aki’s extra sharpness and fitness could see him start against the All Blacks alongside Garry Ringrose, while the back three looks more competitive with the return of Hansen, Keenan, and not to mention the sight of Jacob Stockdale back to his attacking best. While he has earned some game time in this window, his problem is that James Lowe has become such an integral part of the team with his hefty left boot, physicality, offloading and finishing. Then there’s Osborne, outstanding at fullback in both Tests in South Africa and excellent for Leinster at inside centre this season, form and versatility which will be hard to resist in the matchday squad against the All Blacks. As well as an eye for prospective internationals, Farrell places great store by loyalty, with O’Mahony named despite being restricted to just 23 minutes of Munster’s URC round three fixture. There are also places for the other two current centurions, scrumhalf Conor Murray and Cian Healy as one of five props. Healy can, of course, also cover hooker in an emergency, an invaluable commodity in the modern era. Currently on 131 caps, Healy is thus in line to equal and perhaps surpass O’Driscoll’s all-time Irish record of 133 caps.

Title: TSMC halts supply to customer after finding its chip in Huawei product, source says

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co has suspended shipments to a customer after it discovered that one of its chips supplied to the client ended up in a Huawei product, according to a Taiwan official familiar with the situation. About two weeks ago, TSMC suspended shipments to the client and began a detailed investigation, the trade and economic official said, speaking on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. The company has notified the U.S. and Taiwanese governments, the official said as it was an "important warning event" within TSMC, and can, at its earliest, be traced back to Oct. 11. The official did not identify the client TSMC had cut off. TSMC declined comment. A second official told Reuters that TSMC had not informed Taiwan's government of the name of the client. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TSMC had alerted U.S. officials after tech research firm TechInsights took apart a Huawei product and found one of TSMC's chips, Reuters reported on Tuesday, in a possible violation of U.S. export restrictions. The U.S. curbed the export of advanced artificial intelligence chips to China two years ago, citing the need to limit the Chinese military's capabilities. Huawei has been a primary target of the U.S. government's efforts to escalate the use of export controls to keep Chinese companies from obtaining, designing or manufacturing advanced semiconductors. Still, Chinese entities have been trying to circumvent the restrictions and have used cloud services provided by companies such as Amazon to access advanced U.S. chips and AI capabilities, Reuters reported earlier this year. Taiwan's government, wary of its giant neighbour given repeated military and other threats, has its own export control to prevent advanced chips from being made in China, and Taiwan officials say they take compliance with U.S. rules seriously.

Title: Why Humanity Is Waking Up Now!

October 23, 2024 By Neenah Payne Downfall of The Legacy Media shows that the legacy media is rapidly declining because it lost the trust of many Americans. It failed to report accurately on so many issues including the Biden laptop, January 6, the open southern border, COVID, and the injuries and deaths caused by the COVID shots. That failure woke up a lot of folks who now rely on the Alt Media for reliable information. COVID-19 also woke up a lot of people including the following: 1 – Dr. Robert Malone was the inventor of the mRNA and DNA vaccine core platform technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID shots. Dr. Malone recommended against the use of the mRNA technology because it could not be used safely. So, when the mRNA Covid shots were released, he assumed the safety issue had been resolved. He got the shot which caused him many severe problems.However, Dr. Malone is now the President of the Global COVID Summit of 17,000 doctors and has gone around the world since 2020 frequently speaking in opposition to the COVID shots and globalization. He is the author of the 2022 book Lies My Gov’t Told Me: And the Better Future Coming. Dr. Malone is the Medical Director of The Unity Project, a group of 300 organizations across the US standing against mandated COVID vaccines for children.MRNA Inventor Says To Stop COVID “Vaccines” Now shows that when Dr. Malone was interviewed on 6/24/22 by Del Bigtree, host of The Highwire in mRNA PIONEER RAISES COVID VACCINE CONCERNS, Dr. Malone called for an immediate halt to the COVID shots. mRNA VACCINE INVENTOR CALLS FOR STOP OF COVID VAX says, “Dr. Robert Malone, inventor of the mRNA vaccine, sits down with Del to give his honest concerns about why this is the wrong technology to use against #Covid19 and, in particular, the extreme danger it poses to young people.” The Physicians Declaration Calls COVID Policies “Crimes Against Humanity” shows that Dr. Malone read the petition against the COVID shots signed by more than 5,200 doctors. On a trip to Europe, Dr. Malone met Dr. Mattias Desmet, a psychologist, a statistician, and a professor of clinical psychology at Ghent University in Belgium who is the author of the 2022 book The Psychology of Totalitarianism. In Mattias Desmet about Mass Formation and modern society, Tucker Carlson explained that during his interview on the Joe Rogan show #1757 on 12/30/21, Dr. Malone introduced Prof. Desmet’s theory of “Mass Formation” (psychosis) to explain mass compliance with the absurd COVID policies. Desmet says loneliness is the root cause of group think because compliance gives people a sense of belonging. Why Joe Rogan’s Interviews on Mass Psychosis “Broke The Internet” explains that on The Highwire show EPISODE 249: BREAKING MASS PSYCHOSIS on 1/7/22, Bigtree explained that Dr. Peter McCullough on December 18 and Dr. Malone on January 3 discussed the concept of “mass psychosis” on the Joe Rogan show. That sent an overwhelming number of viewers to the internet searching for more information to understand how COVID has been used to drive Americans crazy with fear. Del explained that in WHAT IS MASS FORMATION PSYCHOSIS? IS THE PUBLIC BEING GASLIT? . Kim Iversen showed on January 5 that the term “mass formation psychosis” trended on so many searches over the weekend that it “broke the internet”! When Google censored the information, she went to DuckDuckGo and found that the term came from Joe Rogan’s December 31 interview with Dr. Malone. COVID Mass Psychosis: Causes and Solutions discusses the situation further. Joe Rogan Video Banned from YouTube explains that YouTube censored the episode and it is no longer available! Why Doesn’t Google Want You to Know About ‘Mass Formation Psychosis’? Dr. Malone met former Blackrock Portfolio Manager Edward Dowd in Maui and introduced him to the world. Dowd is the author of Cause Unknown: The Epidemic of Sudden Deaths in 2021 and 2022 and 2023 and has since been widely interviewed. Ed Dowd: COVID Shots Are Causing Youth Democide explains that Dowd discussed shocking excess mortality. “The millennial age group 25 to 44 experienced an 84% increase in excess mortality into the fall. It’s the worst ever excess mortality, I think, in history”. 2 – Dr. Brett Weinstein initially wore masks during COVID. However, Game-Changing Tucker Carlson Interview! shows that when he spoke with Carlson in February 2024, he had become part of the “Dream Team” fighting “Goliath”! In Joe Rogan Experience #2198 Bret Weinstein on 9/4/24, Dr. Weinstein discussed Rescue The Republic – Join The Resistance which he had helped organize to save the West. It was held on The Mall in Washington, DC on September 29. 3 – Dr. Naomi Wolf: Shocking New Book: The Pfizer Papers discusses the 2024 book The Pfizer Papers: Pfizer’s Crimes Against Humanity by New York Times best-selling author Dr. Naomi Wolf. In The Crime of “Talking to Tucker Carlson”, Dr. Wolf explains how COVID woke her up and how that alienated her from much of her family and friends on the Left. 4 – World-renowned British cardiologist Dr. Aseem Malholtra recommended the COVID shot for his father and took it himself. However, when his very healthy father suddenly died at age 73, Dr. Malholtra came to the conclusion that it was because of the COVID shot. Documentary: First Do No Pharm! links to the new film by Dr. Malholtra. The documentary examines the vast amount of fraud in medical research designed to benefit big pharma at the expense of humanity. The following former Democrats have awakened and have left the Democratic Party. 1 – Mikki Willis is the filmmaker who released Plandemic 1 in 2020 which has been seen by over 1 billion people worldwide although social medial blocked it.

However, there is a home for us in the Republican Party. The Republican Party of warmongering elite Dick Cheney is in the past. Trump’s GOP is a big open tent party of the people, equality, commonsense, and the party that is led by a President who has the courage and strength to fight for peace. Tonight I stood with President Trump and announced I am joining the Republican Party. President Trump is our best and only hope in this election to lead our country toward a future where every one of us can live in a truly free, peaceful, and prosperous nation. Now is the time for us to stand together, vote for Trump and save our country. Neenah Payne writes for Activist Post Top image: Katie Horton/YouTube Become a Patron!

Title: YieldMax™ ETFs Announces Distributions on MSTY (175.64%), AIYY (100.45%), SQY (70.37%), YMAX (67.11%), YMAG (14.96%) and Others

October 23, 2024 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Oct. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ today announced distributions for the YieldMax™ ETFs listed in the table below. The performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (833) 378-0717. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs”. Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). 1 All YieldMax™ ETFs (except YMAX, YMAG and ULTY) have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. YMAX and YMAG have a Management Fee of 0.29% and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of 0.99% for a gross expense ratio of 1.28%. “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses” are indirect fees and expenses that the Fund incurs from investing in the shares of other investment companies, namely other YieldMax™ ETFs. ULTY has a gross expense ratio of 1.24% but the investment adviser has agreed to a 0.10% fee waiver through at least February 28, 2025. 2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on October 22, 2024. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future. 3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ended September 30. 2024, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period. As of such date, the ULTY subsidized and unsubsidized 30-Day SEC Yields were 0.00% and 0.00%, respectively. The subsidized yield reflects fee waivers in effect while the unsubsidized yield does not adjust for any fee waivers in effect. 4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. 5 As of the date hereof, distributions for the following ETFs have included return of investor capital: TSLY, OARK, APLY, AMZY, NVDY, GOOY, JPMO, XOMO, PYPY, CONY, DISO, FBY, MSFO, NFLY, SQY, AMDY, MRNY, AIYY, MSTY, ULTY, YMAX, YMAG, YBIT, SNOY, CRSH, GDXY and FIAT. For additional information, please visit www.YieldMaxETFs.com/TaxInfo. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Standardized Performance For YMAX, click here. For YMAG, click here. For TSLY, click here. For OARK, click here. For APLY, click here.

There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs and ZEGA Financial is their sub-adviser. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERNCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX and YMAG generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer time periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given time period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: Could AI Help Employers Make Strides In Workplace Gender Equality?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/10/23/could-ai-help-employers-make-strides-in-workplace-gender-equality/
Time Published: 2024-10-23T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
Punnam Raju Manthena, Co-Founder & CEO at Tekskills Inc. Partnering with clients across the globe in their digital transformation journeys. The gender gap in the workplace remains a key business and economic issue. Back in 2015, a McKinsey report found that reducing the gender gap could add about $12 trillion to $28 trillion to the global GDP by 2025. In 2024, the chief economist for the World Bank stated that closing the gender gap "could raise global gross domestic product by more than 20%." For years, business leaders have been called on to deal with gender equality as an economic need and fundamental right, but progress is still stalled. According to findings from BlackRock, companies "with the most diverse workforces outperformed their country and industry group peers with the least-diverse workforces in terms of return on assets." Businesses with about 30% women in senior positions are 15% more profitable, as per the Victorian Government. This same report found that Australia's GDP would go up by 11% if the gender gap closed. All these point to a serious need for gender equality. So, not only is gender equality beneficial to business and society but equally importantly, gender inequality is detrimental to both. But, as an employer, how do you move toward gender equality? Can AI, the supposed game changer in the IT industry, help gender equality? The advent of AI could potentially open employment doors for women in a big way. AI, or AI-driven automation, is creating several jobs or roles that we did not think of earlier. Aside from technical skills, AI-related roles call for focused nature, communication, collaboration, adaptability, ability to learn, critical thinking, problem-solving, functional knowledge, etc. AI is data-driven and, hence, has the potential to be unbiased—but only if properly trained. Leveraging AI, employers could help develop more inclusive practices in hiring, appraising, awarding hikes, promoting and dealing with career breaks. This could help negate gender-induced interferences and discrimination. Employers could use AI to help rewrite pay-related policies or identify employees who may otherwise get passed over for promotions or those who may leave. Using AI, employers could gather data from multiple sources, viz. incidents, surveys, etc., to identify harassment possibilities, and provide for anonymous reporting, enabling more employees to report without fearing retaliation. This could help businesses build a safe online working environment with a focus on reducing workplace harassment. In doing so, organizations can create a supportive environment and prioritize mitigating the risks associated with workplace misconduct. That said, human intervention is crucial due to the risks associated with AI. However, gender bias in AI is still a very real issue and risk. Women make up only about 33% of the tech employees and only 8% of the managerial roles as per PWC, so have the representation needed to address these biases. A study by the Berkeley Haas Center for Equity, Gender, and Leadership analyzed 133 AI systems in multiple domains and saw that about 44% of them showed gender prejudice. There could be inherent and unintentional gender biases in systems, and since AI works with the available data, these already-existent prejudices may come into play. These prejudices, social barriers, notions, etc., are all hard to break and are difficult to get beyond. Therefore, AI ethics is paramount in this discussion. The tech industry needs to get more women in AI to counter this issue consciously. According to UN Women, "The AI field needs more women, and that requires enabling and increasing girls’ and women’s access to and leadership in STEM and ICT education and careers." To overcome these barriers, tech leaders need to eliminate these biases. We need to ensure women engineers, developers and coders are involved in the creation and training of AI systems. We need to ensure we're genuinely creating a level playing field in hiring, learning, upskilling, appraising and advancing opportunities. To turn things around and achieve greater gender equality at work, we need to prioritize inclusivity when developing these systems, and having many perspectives involved in developing and training AI models can help negate gender-oriented biases. Business leaders need to carefully monitor and advise when implementing AI in HR functions. Human oversight is key to the ethical use of the technology. Employers should ensure their HR teams develop clear and transparent goals, a mature data strategy, proper deployment (of proven tools, technologies and sources), awareness creation, and regular evaluation and course correction where necessary, etc. These guidelines should then be shared with employees at all levels to ensure the company is on the same page. Employers have the potential to create a level playing field in hiring, upskilling, appraising, etc.—to help achieve greater gender equality at work. AI could be a potential asset in a larger gender equality strategy. Those creating AI systems for employers need to develop and train these AI models to negate gender-oriented perspectives; it falls on employers to reframe policies, build a safe online environment and create a supportive environment.

Title: Nvidia's design flaw with Blackwell AI chips now fixed, CEO says

By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Supantha Mukherjee COPENHAGEN/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Wednesday a design flaw with its latest Blackwell AI chips which impacted production has been fixed with the help of longtime Taiwanese manufacturing partner TSMC. Nvidia unveiled Blackwell chips in March and had earlier said they would ship in the second quarter but were delayed, potentially affecting customers such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet's, Google and Microsoft. "We had a design flaw in Blackwell," Huang said. "It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low. It was 100% Nvidia's fault." According to media reports, the delay in production had caused tensions between Nvidia and TSMC but Huang dismissed that as "fake news". "In order to make a Blackwell computer work, seven different types of chips were designed from scratch and had to be ramped into production at the same time," he said. "What TSMC did, was to help us recover from that yield difficulty and resume the manufacturing of Blackwell at an incredible place." Nvidia's Blackwell chips take two squares of silicon the size of the company's previous offering and binds them together into a single component that is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots. At a recent Goldman Sachs conference the CEO said the chips will now ship in the fourth quarter. Huang was in Denmark on Wednesday to launch a new supercomputer named Gefion, which boasts 1,528 graphic processing units (GPUs) and was built in partnership with Novo Nordisk Foundation, Denmark's Export and Investment Fund and Nvidia.

Title: Jim Cramer on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): ‘I Think It’s A Buy Ahead Of The Meeting’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other Jim Cramer stocks. Jim Cramer recently highlighted a promising start to earnings season, pondering whether the two-year-old bull market can continue its upward trajectory during an episode of Mad Money. To address this, Cramer emphasized the importance of keeping emotions in check, cautioning against complacency. He turned to analysis by Jessica Inskip, a prominent figure in the investment community who currently serves as the Director of Investor Research at StockBrokers.com. Inskip, who co-hosts the Market MakeHer podcast, has made important forecasts, including identifying the bottom in big tech growth stocks earlier this year. “... She nailed the bottom in big tech growth stocks this spring, and she's been generally bullish, constructive on the major averages all year. And those are terrific calls. Well, as Inskip sees it, things are looking pretty darn good. But even as the rally's broadening out, moving away from just the Magnificent Seven to a whole host of smaller stocks, she says, we still need tech to participate if we're going to get another leg higher. Tech doesn't have to lead the way anymore, but it has to at least follow the leaders.” Cramer then shifted the conversation to the broader market, querying the potential of stocks outside the tech giants. He pointed out the value of the S&P 500 Equal Weight index, where all 500 components carry equal importance, contrasting it with the traditional market capitalization-weighted index, which heavily favors a few large companies. Cramer noted that 2024 has been particularly favorable for the 493 other stocks within the S&P 500, as the Equal Weight index has shown impressive performance. “First, you can see this thing's been doing great because 2024 has been all about the other 493 stocks in the index. Second, Inksip sees a lot to like here. The trading cycle for the S&P 500 Equal Weight is bullish. “ Cramer mentioned that Inskip is keenly watching for higher highs in this sector. While some technicians may view a rising RSI as a warning sign, Inskip reassures that it is not a concern as long as prices continue to climb. Currently, the S&P Equal Weight index remains well above its key quarterly moving averages, according to Inskip. Cramer reiterated the importance of this Equal Weight perspective, emphasizing that the performance is not overly reliant on the Magnificent Seven, as the broader index is being supported by the remaining stocks. Turning to the Nasdaq 100, which features the hundred largest non-financial stocks on the Nasdaq, Cramer acknowledged that while Inskip sees it in a bullish trading cycle, it hasn’t yet reached new highs like the S&P. Nevertheless, the quarterly moving averages are still trending upward, providing support. Inskip pointed out that the Nasdaq made a higher high back in July, but for it to gain real momentum, it must surpass that peak. Once that level is breached, she believes it could trigger a broader market rally. Coming toward the conclusion, Cramer said: “Bottom line, the charts interpreted by Jessica Inskip are looking pretty darn good for the S&P and the Nasdaq 100… We've got a much broader bull market than we had six months ago. But if it's going to keep running, Inskip says we need to see some meaningful participation from tech.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of stocks that Cramer was bullish on during episodes of Mad Money aired in October. We narrowed the list to 10 stocks that were most favored by analysts. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside as of October 18. The average price target upside was calculated while the market was open. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Average Price Target Upside: 20.70% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Cramer has commended Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO and expressed interest in the company’s analyst day and its result. Here's what he had to say: “Not to be outdone, Lisa Su, the CEO of AMD, will hold an analyst day and it’s entitled Advancing AI 2024. It starts at noon. Today, when the stock was plummeting, I told investing club members at my 10:20 morning meeting that Su’s presentation could show this charitable trust holding in a whole new light, even as they’ve been raising their AI sales forecast quarter after quarter after quarter. I think it’s a buy ahead of the meeting, although the stock did run eight points after we talked about it at the morning meeting.” Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a prominent semiconductor company known for its diverse product offerings, which include x86 microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), chipsets, and various solutions tailored for data centers. The company recently hosted an event titled "Advancing AI" on October 10, where CEO Lisa Su provided insights into the upcoming generation of chips, which showed that the company is making significant progress in its technology development. During the event, Su highlighted the new MI325X chip, which is designed to deliver 80% more high-bandwidth memory compared to the H200 and improve inference performance by 30%. Although the MI325X is not expected to ship until the first quarter of 2025, it represents an important step in Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) ongoing innovation efforts. Su also announced plans to introduce another new GPU, the MI350X, next year. This chip, based on the next-generation CDNA (compute DNA) 4 architecture, is expected to achieve a remarkable 35-fold increase in performance over its predecessor, the MI300X. The MI350X is positioned to compete directly with Nvidia's Blackwell chips, with shipments scheduled to begin in the second half of 2025. Overall AMD ranks 6th on our list of Jim Cramer stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bitcoin Is Suddenly Braced For A Huge Elon Musk And Tesla Earthquake Ahead Of Critical Price ‘Tipping Point’

Bitcoin has swung wildly this last week after Tesla chief executive Elon Musk issued a surprise crypto endorsement. Unlock over $3,000 in perks including unparalleled access to a community of top Web3 entrepreneurs, creators, and investors, providing you with premium networking, priority access to global events, Free access to Forbes.com and our Forbes CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor newsletter. Apply now! The bitcoin price, up over 200% since its recent 2022 lows, has soared this year thanks to Wall Street giant BlackRock leading a bitcoin and crypto "revolution." Now, as Elon Musk warns the U.S. is hurtling toward the brink of "bankruptcy," traders are braced for his electric car company Tesla to post its third quarter earnings, potentially revealing why it suddenly moved its near-$800 million worth of bitcoin last week. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Elon Musk's Tesla sent shock waves through the bitcoin and crypto market when it suddenly moved its ... [+] bitcoin last week, fueling fears Musk could either crash or boost the bitcoin price. "We believe that the Tesla wallet movements that we reported on last week were wallet rotations with the bitcoin still owned by Tesla," blockchain sleuths with Arkham Arkham Intelligence posted to X, adding: "Tesla moved their entire balance of 11,509 bitcoin ($776.9 million) to new wallets." Tesla suddenly moving its bitcoin last week, the first time it's moved for around two years, sparked speculation that it was being moved for an over-the-counter sale. In early 2022, Musk sold off the majority of the $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin he had added to Tesla's balance sheet a year earlier to secure a quarterly profit for the company. Tesla will post its 2024 third-quarter results after the U.S. market closes on Wednesday, October 23, and may reveal why it moved its bitcoin. Tesla is the fourth largest corporate holder of bitcoin after bitcoin mining companies Riot and Marathon and Michael Saylor's software company MicroStrategy—which holds $17 billion worth of bitcoin. This week, Musk surprised the bitcoin and crypto market with an endorsement after recently directing his attention toward criticism of the U.S. spending, repeatedly warning the U.S. is hurtling toward the brink of "bankruptcy." "I think cryptocurrency is an interesting and probably valuable bulwark against centralized control," Musk said, speaking at a campaign rally for former U.S. president Donald Trump in Pittsburgh when asked by an attendee whether the cryptocurrency XRP XRP could be incorporated into the financial system. "Crypto by its very nature helps with individual freedom," Musk said, adding he wasn't endorsing XRP or any other specific cryptocurrency. Musk later said he "wasn't actively involved in crypto," dodging a question about whether blockchains, the technology that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, could be used in future elections to reduce or eliminate voter fraud. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged back toward its all-time highs this year, with Tesla and Elon Musk ... [+] poised to trigger a major bitcoin price move. Meanwhile, bitcoin and crypto traders are closely watching the polls ahead of next month's U.S. presidential election, which could be a bitcoin price "tipping point." "Take a bird’s eye view of bitcoin, and the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency has been stuck in a holding pattern since March. The question on everyone’s lips is, ‘what will it take to move it?'" Richard Ptardio, cryptocurrency and financial markets analyst, said in emailed comments. "Bitcoin bulls are looking at next month’s U.S. election as the tipping point. Should Donald Trump be returned to the White House, the promise of a low-regulation administration and the likely removal of Gary Gensler as U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair could break the resistance required for new all-time highs," Ptardio said. Trump has enthusiastically embraced bitcoin and crypto this year, backing his family's World Liberty Financial crypto project and selling four non-fungible token (NFT APENFT ) collections. Speaking earlier this year at a bitcoin conference, Trump promised to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve if reelected and predicted the bitcoin price could eventually eclipse gold. "However, even with Trump in office, bears may be right to sound a note of caution," Ptardio said. "There are signs that bitcoin is no longer the safe haven from the type of geo-political uncertainty that tends to follow him." One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Peloton is going to sell its deluxe stationary bikes at Costco to reach holiday shoppers this Christmas
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/23/peloton-sell-deluxe-stationary-bikes-costco-holiday-shoppers-christmas/
Time Published: 2024-10-23T10:09:47Z

Peloton plans to sell its deluxe stationary bike at Costco this holiday season as the struggling connected-exercise company seeks to broaden its customer base. The Peloton Bike+, a stationary bike that enables riders to participate in online classes and work out with a virtual community of friends, will be sold at a discount online and in 300 Costco stores from November through mid-February, the companies announced Tuesday. The model will sell in Costco stores for $1,999 and will require self-assembly. That’s about $500 cheaper than buying a new bike directly through Peloton’s website, a purchase which includes delivery and setup. Costco will also sell the Peloton Bike+ on its website for $2,199, which includes delivery. “The Costco brand is incredibly powerful and respected in the U.S. and abroad,” Dion Camp Sanders, Peloton’s chief emerging business officer, said in a news release. “Costco members know they are shopping for high quality products from trusted brands with the best value.” The partnership with Costco is a way for Peloton to cast a wider net and make its products more accessible, said Angeli Gianchandani, an adjunct instructor at New York University’s School of Professional Studies. “Costco might be known for low cost, but at the same time they don’t shy away from carrying high-end products,” Gianchandani said. “And this falls in line with that strategy and how they carry their product selection to really appeal to a wider demographic that’s affluent, and they appreciate quality and value.” Once marketed as an exclusive, aspirational brand, Peloton began rebranding itself to be seen as more accessible as it grappled with falling sales and a plummeting stock price. In August 2022, the company made its exercise bikes and other gear available for purchase on Amazon in the U.S. The Peloton Bike+ is a step up from the original Peloton bike because it has a rotating touch-screen and a resistance knob that can be set to automatically adjust to an instructor’s recommendations. To participate in classes, riders purchase an all-access membership for $44 a month, which also includes classes in meditation, strength training, yoga and other disciplines. Peloton’s choice to sell at Costco “appears to be based not just on Costco’s size and formidable footprint, but the nature of the demographics that shop at the warehouse club,” said Kimberly Whitler, an associate professor of business administration at the University of Virginia. “Specifically, it appears that they are attempting to reach younger, wealthier individuals who are likely a prime demographic group.” Costco Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said on an earnings call in September that about half of the retailers new members this year were under 40 years old. Sales of Peloton bikes soared during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, when gyms closed and many people stayed home to reduce the risk of contracting or spreading the virus. The company’s share price surpassed $150 in late 2020. But the growth was unsustainable, and slowed when pandemic restrictions began to ease. Peloton also issued damaging recalls including one of about 125,000 treadmills in 2021 after they were linked to a child’s death and dozens of injuries, and another of more than 2 million bikes that had a seat post which could break during use. Facing these challenges, Peloton’s stock price began a long tumble. It has been trading below $7 a share for all of 2024. In May, Peloton cut 400 jobs and CEO Barry McCarthy stepped down. Peloton also has been selling refurbished bikes on its website, charging $1,145 for a used standard Peloton and $1,995 for a used Peloton Bike+. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

It sells at 18 times earnings. It’s down today because of I think the storms, but you know what? Disney is doing much better than people realize. And it’s about time, people started giving a little more respect. I’m a buyer of it. The analysts are dumping all over it. They’re dumping all over it now. I say buy more Disney.” Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the biggest names in the global entertainment industry, engaging in various sectors such as film and television production, streaming services, and theme park operations. On October 15, UBS maintained its Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $120. UBS expects results for the fourth quarter to show challenges in the Parks division while highlighting profitability in direct-to-consumer segments, improved box office performance, and consistent trends in linear television. The firm projects a year-over-year revenue increase of 7.2%, estimating an EBIT rise to $3.7 billion from $3 billion in the previous year, which could lead to a 33% growth in earnings per share for the quarter. For fiscal year 2024, the firm expects EPS growth exceeding 30%, aligning with management's guidance of $4.92. Furthermore, mid-single-digit EPS growth is expected for fiscal year 2025, with the potential benefits from the deconsolidation of India assets and cost efficiencies from Hulu expected to create additional opportunities as the year unfolds. Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is set to introduce a new attraction entry pass called the Lightning Lane Premier Pass. It allows guests willing to pay between $129 and $449 to enjoy exclusive access to some of the park's most popular attractions. A limited number of these passes will be available starting October 23 at Disneyland in California, followed by a launch at Disney World a week later.

Title: Tokenization Unstoppable: Mega Whale Holds 3 Tons of Gold Onchain

Gold, the original store of value, is inching closer to $3,000 and is currently trading above $2,700, printing fresh all-time highs in the process. As the yellow metal stretches gains, capital may flow to Bitcoin, the digital alternative, forcing the world’s most valuable coin above $74,000. While gold and Bitcoin have advantages, with the more suave favoring the fluidity of BTC, one holder seems to be interested in both. A recent analysis by Arkham, a blockchain intelligence firm, reveals that one wallet holds over $250 million in Tether Gold. In the real world, this tokenized stash weighs approximately 3 tons. For now, the owner of this tokenized stash remains unknown. However, using AI, Arkham speculates that the 3 tons of gold belong to RhinoFi. According to on-chain data, the layer-2 bridge has processed over $2.3 billion worth of assets from more than 48.8 million transactions. It currently bridges 31 chains, connecting over 2 million accounts. Tether Gold is technically a stablecoin tracking the real-world value of gold. As of October 22, over 246,520 tokens of digital gold had been minted on Ethereum. According to Ethplorer, there are 2,618 token holders making more than 39,500 transfers. Although it cannot be immediately determined that RhinoFi controls nearly 50% of all Tether Gold in circulation, tokenization is picking up traction. The success of USD-backed stablecoins like USDT and USDC and their widespread adoption, especially in emerging economies, explain why they are here to stay. Converting real-world assets into tokens on public ledgers like Ethereum or Polygon makes it easier for users to transfer and gain exposure. The CEO of BlackRock predicts the tokenization market will command trillions in the next few years. Coingecko data shows over $7.9 billion of assets have been tokenized. Most of them are on Ondo, Pendle, and Mantra. Beyond Tether Gold, other tokenized alternatives include Pax Gold and Quorium. In addition to gold, real estate and United States Treasuries have been tokenized. BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, currently issues BUIDL on Ethereum. Looking at rwa.xyz data, over $2.4 billion worth of United States treasuries, bonds, and other cash equivalents have been tokenized. BlackRock’s BUIDL currently manages over $550 million of tokenized treasuries. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Ambani’s Jio in Talks With Allianz for Insurance JVs in India

Jio Financial Services Ltd., controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has held talks with Allianz SE to set up an insurance partnership in India as the German firm seeks to scrap two existing joint ventures in the country, according to people familiar with the matter. Allianz and Jio Financial are looking to establish a general insurance and a life insurance company in the South Asian nation, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. The discussions are in early stages and both parties may decide not to proceed with the plan, the people said. The Munich-based firm has indicated to its current partner Bajaj Finserv Ltd. that it’s “actively considering an exit” from the ventures, according to a statement from Bajaj on Tuesday after Bloomberg News reported the planned split. Allianz “has indicated that it remains committed to the Indian insurance market,” according to the statement. The break-up centers around a dispute over the direction of the partnership, people familiar with the matter had said. A spokesperson for Jio Financial said the firm is unable to comment on speculation. “If and when there are any material developments with respect to the company, we will continue to make necessary disclosures in accordance with our obligations, as we always have,” the spokesperson added. Allianz doesn’t comment on market rumors, a Munich-based spokesperson said. Jio Financial, helmed by veteran banker K.V. Kamath, already runs a shadow bank and an insurance brokerage and has joined forces with BlackRock Inc. to start an asset management business. Setting up insurance operations will help further the Ambani unit’s ambition of becoming a financial services behemoth. India’s insurance penetration rate — the ratio of premiums to gross domestic product — is less than half that of countries such as South Africa and Canada, implying strong growth prospects for the sector, insurance regulator data show.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. Artificial Intelligence developments are making headlines across various sectors. From high-profile legal battles to groundbreaking advancements in model performance and safety protocols, AI is reshaping the landscape across industries at an unprecedented pace. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings Before we move on to the breaking news on AI, let’s talk about Morningstar’s recent report. The investment research firm reveals that for the third consecutive year, investors are leaving exchange-traded funds related to specific themes for funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks "that are hitting record highs". Despite overall growth in equity ETFs, thematic ETFs have lost $5.8 billion in investor capital in the year 2024. This is greater than $4.8 billion outflows in all of 2023. The reason? Broad market index returns are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. "It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out”. As per Morningstar, thematic ETFs often struggle due to mistimed investments, with investors usually missing out on two-thirds of their returns. Despite some AI-themed funds having strong holdings, higher fees and timing challenges reduce their overall appeal. "I think that when S&P 500 megacaps stop delivering the way they do today, the focus will shift back to thematic ETFs”. Moreover, while AI remains a key focus in many thematic ETFs, its impact goes far beyond investing. Consider Penguin Random House, the first of the Big Five anglophone trade publishers to amend its copyright information. The publisher has recently added a language to its copyright pages to prohibit the use of those books to train AI. Publishers and AI firms will be increasingly clashing in the future if clear guidelines and processes aren’t kept in place. In a similar endeavor, The New York Times has sent Perplexity AI, an AI-powered research firm, a "cease and desist" notice demanding that it stop using the newspaper's content for generative AI purposes. The news publisher claims that the way the AI Company uses its material violates copyright law. In other news, Anthropic, a U.S.-based artificial intelligence public-benefit startup, is now adding a comprehensive update to its safety policy, reinforcing the guardrails of its AI as it becomes more capable. This push to improve AI safety is in stark contrast to competitors such as OpenAI, whose increasing focus on improving capabilities and performance is very likely to threaten safety guidelines in the future. As per McKinsey, 63% of companies consider inaccuracy risk to be relevant. However, only 38% of companies are working to mitigate the risk. While artificial intelligence may be intimidating, it is equally, if not more, beneficial for mankind. In its latest achievement, AI has helped UCLA researchers develop a deep-learning framework that teaches itself to automatically analyze and diagnose MRIs and other 3D medical images. That too, with the accuracy matching that of medical specialists in a fraction of the time. Another breakthrough from Archetype AI, a physical AI company, is set to significantly change how we understand and interact with the physical world. The model, named Newton, shows the unparalleled capacity to generalize across diverse physical phenomena using only raw sensor measurements as input. Finally, in our roundup of the latest AI news, the US rules that will ban certain US investments in artificial intelligence in China are under final review, as per a government posting. The rules, requiring US investors to notify the Treasury Department regarding some investments in AI and other stem technologies, come from an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023. The order aims to keep American investors' know-how from aiding China's military. Chipmakers and related companies that may be impacted by the decisions denied responding to Reuters' requests for comment. Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an American multinational corporation and technology company that develops and markets software, services, and hardware. The company’s AI strategy is evident through its partnership with OpenAI and the integration of AI across Azure, Office 365, and security solutions which together create a strong ecosystem. On Monday, October 21, Microsoft had its “AI Tour” in London, announcing the rollout of its Copilot AI features designed to enhance productivity by automating routine administrative tasks. The company plans to allow businesses to create their own autonomous agents within the Copilot Studio, Microsoft’s platform for building and customizing its “Copilot” assistants, fending off challenges from Salesforce. These agents can be built in the studio with low code or no code instructions, which in turn allow users to create AI-driven workflows without needing major technical expertise. The software will be available for public preview next month. The technology company has also revealed that it will launch 10 new autonomous agents in Dynamics 365, which is the company’s suite of enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management apps. The company’s autonomous agents aim to achieve a return on investment in AI. As per CFO Amy Hood, the company has spent $19 billion on capital expenditures, including finance leases, a large portion of which was derived from AI and cloud-related needs. With 2.1 million users engaged with Copilot, Microsoft is banking heavily on the platform to generate revenues. As of Q4, the company achieved $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue from its cloud services, which includes its AI platform, a 21% year-over-year increase. While all these announcements may seem like a big leap for Microsoft, the company received a rare downgrade last month over concerns about the tech giant’s over-reliance on Nvidia for its AI infrastructure. On September 23, analysts at D.A. Davidson, an investment banking company, downgraded the company’s stock from “Buy” to “Neutral”, keeping their price target unchanged at $475. While the analysts are still positive about Microsoft, they note how the company lags behind its rivals in AI chip development, something its rivals started working on as early as a decade ago. “They started their chip development later than Amazon and Google. But apart from that, they’re doing what they need to do.” Overall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global technology company engineering the most advanced chips, systems, and software for the AI factories of the future. The company is said to represent “the dominant” infrastructure player behind the current rise of the AI sector. Wall Street is abuzz with excitement about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s new AI chip, Blackwell. Sector analysts are enthusiastic about the company’s potential major upside in the fourth quarter with all the initial rush of Blackwell. On October 18, Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, discussed on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts how things are looking up for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) . According to Lumida CEO, the company is still in the “early innings” and expects that Nvidia’s stock will reach $150 between now and the end of the year. With the hyperscalers intending to each spend between $50 and $100 billion on GPU compute, the primary beneficiary is going to be NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), he says. Lumidia's CEO further commented how the company has a class of its own and doesn’t have a “close competitor”. There is a growing confidence that the chip giant will be the first Tech firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation. "We made a call earlier this year that Nvidia would be the most valuable company in the world. It achieved that milestone yesterday, and the demand for GPU chips is strong. And you're seeing enterprises start to get some ROI (return on investment) on it from the early adopters”. On Friday, October 18, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated his “Buy” rating on the stock, raising his price target by $25 to $190. From Taiwan Semiconductor's (one of Nvidia’s major suppliers) third-quarter results to the “insane” demand for Blackwell chips as quoted by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the analyst believes that recent industry trends have the potential to increase the company’s lead and generational opportunity. Furthermore, “underappreciated” enterprise partnerships with companies are also catalysts for more growth. “We also highlight a growing presence of AI in enterprise, where NVDA is the partner of choice (more on pg. 10)”. According to the bank’s forecast, the AI technology market will grow from $45 billion in 2023 to $117 billion this year while Nvidia maintains a 75% market share, which translated to a staggering $272 billion in AI computing revenues for Nvidia by 2030. Arya also believes the company could see at least $200 billion in free cash flow generation over the next two years. Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Despite overall growth in equity ETFs, thematic ETFs have lost $5.8 billion in investor capital in the year 2024. This is greater than $4.8 billion outflows in all of 2023. The reason? Broad market index returns are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. "It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out”. As per Morningstar, thematic ETFs often struggle due to mistimed investments, with investors usually missing out on two-thirds of their returns. Despite some AI-themed funds having strong holdings, higher fees and timing challenges reduce their overall appeal. "I think that when S&P 500 megacaps stop delivering the way they do today, the focus will shift back to thematic ETFs”. Moreover, while AI remains a key focus in many thematic ETFs, its impact goes far beyond investing. Consider Penguin Random House, the first of the Big Five anglophone trade publishers to amend its copyright information. The publisher has recently added a language to its copyright pages to prohibit the use of those books to train AI. Publishers and AI firms will be increasingly clashing in the future if clear guidelines and processes aren’t kept in place. In a similar endeavor, The New York Times has sent Perplexity AI, an AI-powered research firm, a "cease and desist" notice demanding that it stop using the newspaper's content for generative AI purposes. The news publisher claims that the way the AI Company uses its material violates copyright law. In other news, Anthropic, a U.S.-based artificial intelligence public-benefit startup, is now adding a comprehensive update to its safety policy, reinforcing the guardrails of its AI as it becomes more capable. This push to improve AI safety is in stark contrast to competitors such as OpenAI, whose increasing focus on improving capabilities and performance is very likely to threaten safety guidelines in the future. As per McKinsey, 63% of companies consider inaccuracy risk to be relevant. However, only 38% of companies are working to mitigate the risk. While artificial intelligence may be intimidating, it is equally, if not more, beneficial for mankind. In its latest achievement, AI has helped UCLA researchers develop a deep-learning framework that teaches itself to automatically analyze and diagnose MRIs and other 3D medical images. That too, with the accuracy matching that of medical specialists in a fraction of the time. Another breakthrough from Archetype AI, a physical AI company, is set to significantly change how we understand and interact with the physical world. The model, named Newton, shows the unparalleled capacity to generalize across diverse physical phenomena using only raw sensor measurements as input. Finally, in our roundup of the latest AI news, the US rules that will ban certain US investments in artificial intelligence in China are under final review, as per a government posting. The rules, requiring US investors to notify the Treasury Department regarding some investments in AI and other stem technologies, come from an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023. The order aims to keep American investors' know-how from aiding China's military. Chipmakers and related companies that may be impacted by the decisions denied responding to Reuters' requests for comment. Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

Title: Kamala Harris Has More Billionaires Prominently Backing Her Than Trump—Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer Weigh In (Update)

Time Published: 2024-10-22T22:43:17Z
Full Content:
Forbes found at least 100 billionaires in the corners of either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris—with many more backing Harris—but unlike the world’s richest man Elon Musk, who stumps extensively on Trump’s behalf, many have elected to watch from the sidelines, like Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg. Trump and Harris during their September presidential debate. Our breakdown records 81 billionaires supporting Harris and 50 backing Trump so far (see the lists for both below). Many more billionaires may still financially back a candidate, but their donations won’t be learned until after the election, when final Federal Election Commission reports are issued in December. Billionaires leaning toward Harris may seem incongruous, since she often criticizes Trump for advocating for policies favorable toward billionaires—but there are practical reasons why the ultra wealthy may favor Harris. A letter signed by more than a dozen billionaires last month endorsing Harris explained their belief Harris “will continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment,” indicating the support for the status quo as the U.S. economy and stock market exhibit strength, while a recent survey of millionaire investors—which found a 57% to 43% split in Harris’s favor—identified technology, healthcare and sustainability stocks as the sectors most poised to benefit from a Harris win, a mix friendly to many of her billionaire backers from Silicon Valley, who grew familiar with Harris during her time as a California prosecutor. Forbes will update this list through Election Day. Jeff Bezos, left, Larry Page, second from left, Sheryl Sandberg, former chief operating officer of ... [+] Facebook, then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence and then-President-elect Donald Trump meet in 2016. Bill Gates: Though his ex-wife French Gates is among Harris’ deepest backers—her reported $13 million donation to Harris groups would place her among the top individual donors this cycle—the Microsoft cofounder Gates has not officially endorsed a candidate, but appeared to offer positive words toward Harris in a July interview, saying it is “great to have somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI and how we shape that in the right way.” But “I don’t tell other people how to vote” due to his work with his nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates added. UPDATE (Oct. 22): Gates told allies he donated $50 million to the non-profit wing of a Democratic political action committee supporting Harris, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the situation. The bombshell report goes against Gates’ history of public nonpartisanship. Though Gates did not confirm the donation to the Times, he hinted at his Harris backing in a statement, saying he supports “candidates who demonstrate a clear commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty and fighting climate change” and “this election is different” than those of the past. Jamie Dimon: Trump shared a false social media post touting Dimon’s endorsement, but the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, did not endorse any candidate, according to his spokesperson. Still, some see hints in Dimon’s words. He’s been outspoken about the election, penning an opinion in The Washington Post calling on voters “to elect a president who is dedicated to the ideals that define and unite us.” UPDATE (Oct. 22): The Times reported Dimon has privately endorsed Harris and has indicated he’s open to a role in her administration, including the top economic role of Treasury secretary. Dimon spokesman Joe Evangelisti told the Times the banker “has never publicly endorsed a presidential candidate.” Dimon’s wife, Judith Kent, has donated more than $250,000 to Democratic causes in 2024 through the couple’s joint The James and Judith K Dimon Foundation, according to Federal Election Commission filings. A source close to Dimon told Forbes that the JPMorgan chief is not considering a role in either a Harris or Trump administration. Steve Ballmer, UPDATE (Oct. 22): Ballmer, the owner of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers and former chief executive of Microsoft, made clear in an interview with Forbes last week he will not endorse a candidate, though he has shelled out more than $40 million to his not-for-profit company USAFacts to arm the public with easily accessible government data. “At some point all the money does is help bid up the price of ads on Facebook,” Ballmer bemoaned to Forbes about the impact traditional political spending can have. Connie Ballmer, the wife of the world’s 10th-richest person, has donated more than $300,000 to Democratic causes this year, according to government records, but “I don't control my wife and would never want to,” Steve Ballmer added about what that indicates about his own leanings. Jeff Bezos: The Amazon founder and world’s fourth-richest man wrote Trump “showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire” following the assassination attempt at a July 13 rally, but Bezos has not endorsed or financially backed, even though he has publicly warred with Trump during his presidency. He celebrated Biden’s election in 2020 with an Instagram post noting the Biden win indicated “unity, empathy, and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era.” Warren Buffett: Though Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett said in 2020 he’s a Democrat and clapped back at Trump in 2016 for an income tax jab, Buffett, the world’s sixth-richest person, has also stayed quiet this cycle. UPDATE (Oct. 23): Berkshire released a statement Wednesday that Buffett won’t publicly “endorse and support political candidates.” Buffett explained to CNBC he’s “worried about people impersonating” him and “nobody should believe anybody saying I’m telling them how to...vote.” Mark Zuckerberg: Trump told New York Magazine that Zuckerberg said to him he can’t “vote for a Democrat in this election” after the assassination attempt. But a Meta spokesperson said Zuckerberg, the third-wealthiest person on the planet, is “not endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.” In 2020, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $419 million toward organizations supporting in-person voting during the pandemics. The Meta CEO and Facebook cofounder called Trump’s response to the assassination attempt “badass” in a July interview. Ray Dalio: Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, told CNBC last month it’s the “most consequential” election of his, but he won’t endorse Harris or Trump as he desires a more moderate candidate. Sergey Brin: The Google cofounder and eighth-wealthiest person in the world Brin said following the 2016 election he found Trump’s election “deeply offensive” as an immigrant, according to an internal video leaked in 2018, but has not made public any feelings during this cycle. Larry Ellison and Ken Griffin: Ellison and Griffin are perhaps the most surprising billionaires who have stayed quiet in the final months of the presidential election cycle considering both have donated millions to Republican causes in the past. Griffin (Citadel) confirmed Thursday he has not financially backed Trump, adding he’s “torn” and won’t vote with a “smile on my face” as both candidates aren’t “going to receive an award for the quality of their policies” or “the quality of their leadership.” Ellison (Oracle), the second-richest person on earth, had backed Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), while Griffin, the 39th-wealthiest, had been a Gov. Nikki Haley (R-S.C.) supporter. A total of 81 billionaires (or more) are backing Harris. Forbes identified these 28 billionaires who donated $1 million toward groups supporting Harris through August: Michael Bloomberg, left, and Harris appear together in 2023. The following 36 billionaires made between $50,000 and $999,999 in donations to groups supporting Harris through August, according to Forbes’ analysis of FEC data: Bloomberg reported these additional four billionaires have donated to Harris’ election funds or groups supporting Harris’ election: These six billionaires signed a Sept. 6 open letter supporting Harris: UPDATE (Oct. 16): And these three billionaires donated to a Harris committee during the third quarter, according to FEC filings analyzed by The New York Times: And there's music stars Bruce Springsteen, who backed Harris Oct. 3, and Taylor Swift, who endorsed Harris Sept. 10. A total of 51 billionaires have been identified as Trump backers. Forbes identified in August these 26 billionaires who had donated at least $1 million toward Trump election efforts: Musk, right, jumps on stage as he joins Trump at a Saturday rally. Another 16 billionaires gave between $50,000 and $999,999 to groups supporting Trump through that period: UPDATE (Oct. 16): The New York Times named the following three billionaires as donating at least $100,000 to Trump groups last quarter: And of course there’s Elon Musk (Tesla and SpaceX CEO), who gave $75 million last quarter to his pro-Trump America PAC, according to filings released Tuesday. Other known Trump supporters include Jeff Hildebrand (Hilcorp), Isaac Perlmutter (Marvel Entertainment), Thomas Peterffy (Interactive Brokers) and Gary Rollins (Rollins Inc.), according to media reports and Bloomberg’s analysis of public election records last month. UPDATE (Oct. 22): This article was updated to include Dimon’s reported private backing of Harris, Gates’ reported donation to Harris and Ballmer’s comments on political spending. In addition, the New Yorker recently reported activist investor Nelson Peltz hosted a February fundraiser for Trump, where Peltz reportedly quipped Trump is “a terrible human being, but our country’s in a bad place, and we can’t afford Joe Biden.” Peltz has not made public comment since Biden ceded way to Harris, and his Trian Partners asset manager did not return a request for comment. A pair of other Wall Street billionaires have said the stock market is heavily leaning toward Trump in Daniel Loeb and Stanley Druckenmiller, though neither have publicly endorsed or made major donations toward a candidate. Fellow hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman told Fox Business he doesn’t plan to vote for either major candidate. Kyle Khan-Mullins and Leo Kalmin contributed reporting. One Community. Many Voices.

The transaction, executed on October 18, 2024, was conducted at a price of $580.65 per share, totaling approximately $239,808. This sale was carried out under a pre-established Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which Olivan adopted on August 30, 2023. Following this transaction, Olivan holds 11,120 shares directly. Additionally, he maintains indirect ownership of shares through various entities, including Olivan D LLC and the Olivan Reinhold Family Revocable Trust. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). has reintroduced its facial recognition technology to combat fraudulent advertisements, a move that comes after a three-year hiatus. The technology will be used in a trial involving approximately 50,000 public figures, comparing their Facebook profile photos against images in suspected scam ads. The company has also released new artificial intelligence (AI) models, including a "Self-Taught Evaluator," which aims to reduce human involvement in the AI development process. In addition, a Massachusetts judge has denied Meta's bid to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the company of designing features on its Instagram platform to addict young users. Meanwhile, financial firms TD Cowen and Mizuho Securities have raised their price targets on Meta's stock, citing potential revenue growth and market performance. These developments reflect Meta's ongoing efforts to balance technological advancement with regulatory compliance and user privacy, as well as the company's potential for growth in the eyes of financial analysts. As Meta Platforms' COO Javier Olivan trims his stake, InvestingPro data reveals a compelling financial picture for the tech giant. Meta's market capitalization stands at an impressive $1.47 trillion, reflecting its dominant position in the social media landscape. The company's P/E ratio of 27.3 (adjusted for the last twelve months) suggests a relatively reasonable valuation considering its growth prospects. InvestingPro Tips highlight Meta's strong financial health, noting that the company "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet" and "liquid assets exceed short-term obligations." These factors indicate Meta's solid financial footing, which may provide reassurance to investors despite insider selling activity. Moreover, Meta's revenue growth of 24.28% over the last twelve months and an outstanding gross profit margin of 81.49% underscore the company's ability to generate substantial returns. An InvestingPro Tip points out Meta's "impressive gross profit margins," which align with the company's efficient operational model. It's worth noting that Meta is "trading near its 52-week high," with its current price at 96.52% of that peak. This performance, coupled with a year-to-date total return of 62.98%, suggests strong investor confidence in the company's direction and potential.

BofA Securities analyst Justin Post maintained a Buy rating on Meta Platforms Inc META with a price target of $630. Meta’s third-quarter earnings will likely exceed expectations with revenue of $40.4 billion and EPS of $5.35, slightly above Street estimates of $40.2 billion and $5.19, respectively, as per Post. The growth is driven by several factors, including new AI tools and CRM integration, which are boosting return on investment (ROI) and increasing ad spend. Also Read: Meta’s Smart Glasses Dominate Ray-Ban Stores, AI Features Still Missing Messaging and Reel monetization are ramping up, and a modest 100-200 bps benefit from political ad spending is expected. Post noted that Meta could lower the upper end of its 2024 expense guide by $1 billion, from $98.2 billion to $96 billion—$98 billion, thanks to layoffs and a reduction in job openings. Capex, however, could trend toward the higher end of guidance, between $37 billion—$40 billion, as Meta continues to invest heavily in AI infrastructure, as per the analyst. The fourth-quarter revenue guidance will likely range between $45 billion—$47.5 billion, with ad revenue growth decelerating by 2 points to 16% year-over-year, he noted However, as per Post, growing AI benefits for ad targeting, more robust Reels usage, and incremental political ad spending could offer marginal upside. He said Meta remains well-positioned in AI, with analysts forecasting multi-year growth opportunities, particularly through generative AI and infrastructure developments. Despite potential near-term volatility due to high expectations, Meta’s stock has risen 63% year-to-date, maintaining its status as a top AI pick. Price Action: META stock is up 1.23% at $582.21 at last check Tuesday. Also Read: Image via Shutterstock © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

Title: Peloton plans to sell its deluxe stationary bike at Costco to reach holiday shoppers

Peloton plans to sell its deluxe stationary bike at Costco this holiday season as the struggling connected-exercise company seeks to broaden its customer base NEW YORK -- Peloton plans to sell its deluxe stationary bike at Costco this holiday season as the struggling connected-exercise company seeks to broaden its customer base. The Peloton Bike+, a stationary bike that enables riders to participate in online classes and work out with a virtual community of friends, will be sold at a discount online and in 300 Costco stores from November through mid-February, the companies announced Tuesday. The model will sell in Costco stores for $1,999 and will require self-assembly. That's about $500 cheaper than buying a new bike directly through Peloton's website, a purchase which includes delivery and setup. Costco will also sell the Peloton Bike+ on its website for $2,199, which includes delivery. “The Costco brand is incredibly powerful and respected in the U.S. and abroad," Dion Camp Sanders, Peloton's chief emerging business officer, said in a news release. “Costco members know they are shopping for high quality products from trusted brands with the best value.” The partnership with Costco is a way for Peloton to cast a wider net and make its products more accessible, said Angeli Gianchandani, an adjunct instructor at New York University's School of Professional Studies. “Costco might be known for low cost, but at the same time they don’t shy away from carrying high-end products,” Gianchandani said. “And this falls in line with that strategy and how they carry their product selection to really appeal to a wider demographic that’s affluent, and they appreciate quality and value.” Once marketed as an exclusive, aspirational brand, Peloton began rebranding itself to be seen as more accessible as it grappled with falling sales and a plummeting stock price. In August 2022, the company made its exercise bikes and other gear available for purchase on Amazon in the U.S. The Peloton Bike+ is a step up from the original Peloton bike because it has a rotating touch-screen and a resistance knob that can be set to automatically adjust to an instructor’s recommendations. To participate in classes, riders purchase an all-access membership for $44 a month, which also includes classes in meditation, strength training, yoga and other disciplines. Peloton’s choice to sell at Costco “appears to be based not just on Costco’s size and formidable footprint, but the nature of the demographics that shop at the warehouse club,” said Kimberly Whitler, an associate professor of business administration at the University of Virginia. “Specifically, it appears that they are attempting to reach younger, wealthier individuals who are likely a prime demographic group.” Costco Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said on an earnings call in September that about half of the retailers new members this year were under 40 years old. Sales of Peloton bikes soared during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, when gyms closed and many people stayed home to reduce the risk of contracting or spreading the virus. The company's share price surpassed $150 in late 2020. But the growth was unsustainable, and slowed when pandemic restrictions began to ease. Peloton also issued damaging recalls including one of about 125,000 treadmills in 2021 after they were linked to a child’s death and dozens of injuries, and another of more than 2 million bikes that had a seat post which could break during use. Facing these challenges, Peloton's stock price began a long tumble. It has been trading below $7 a share for all of 2024. In May, Peloton cut 400 jobs and CEO Barry McCarthy stepped down. Peloton also has been selling refurbished bikes on its website, charging $1,145 for a used standard Peloton and $1,995 for a used Peloton Bike+. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Amazon to shut down speedy brick-and-mortar delivery service

Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Amazon is shutting down a service that offers same-day delivery from mall and brick-and-mortar retailers, CNBC has learned. The company has stopped any new development of the service, called Amazon Today, and will begin to wind it down, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The people asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the press. The bulk of the program will be shut down by Dec. 2, the people said. Select retail partners will be able to continue fulfilling orders with Amazon Today through Jan. 24, 2025, Amazon told CNBC. A small amount of employees will be laid off and provided with severance, while others will be transitioned to other positions within Amazon, the company said. Employees who work on Amazon Today learned the news in a meeting on Monday, where some staffers were informed they would be laid off, the people said. Roughly 300 employees were working on Amazon Today, the people said. The closure of Amazon Today is the latest example of the company’s broader cost-cutting efforts. Since 2022, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been on a campaign to cut costs across the company in order to meet rapidly changing macro conditions. Beginning in 2022 and extending through 2024, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs. Jassy has taken a harder line on the company’s unproven, costlier bets than his predecessor, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Jassy has axed several projects, including a telehealth service, video-calling device for kids and a roving Treasure Truck. Launched in 2022, Amazon Today allows retailers who sell on Amazon to offer speedy delivery from their brick-and-mortar stores and shopping malls in select cities. Amazon’s contracted Flex drivers, which make deliveries using their own vehicles, fetch the packages and drop them at customers’ doorsteps within hours of when the orders were placed. Amazon Today was part of the company’s push to get online purchases to shoppers’ doorsteps at faster speeds. Amazon continues to add more facilities focused on same-day deliveries in a bid to boost sales and compete with other companies that provide ultrafast delivery. That includes Instacart and DoorDash, which have expanded beyond food and groceries and into retail. The company had signed up several retailers to Amazon Today, according to the program’s website. That list included Office Depot; Staples; Petco; PacSun; vitamin and dietary supplement chain GNC; and Fabletics, the athletic-wear brand owned by actress Kate Hudson. Amazon is working with the retailers it signed up for the service to ensure a smooth transition for them, the company said. Amazon added that it continues to prioritize and invest in fast delivery. The decision to shutter Amazon Today comes as a surprise since Amazon was in the process of onboarding other retailers, one of the people said. The company was also pitching the service to more retailers at a conference last week. The service skewed more costly than traditional delivery routes where Flex drivers can fill their cars up with packages from an Amazon warehouse, one of the people said. Amazon Today routes, which the company calls “retail deliveries,” did not usually fill up a driver’s trunk, making the program less worthwhile for the Flex contractors.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares hit all-time highs Monday, continuing the impressive multi-year run of going from a $1 trillion company to a company worth over $3 trillion. Many Nvidia employees and investors have been rejoicing in the stock gains over the last year and one of the big winners is a member of Congress. What Happened: Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her husband, venture capitalist Paul Pelosi are among the investors who have been adding Nvidia stock and options to their investment portfolios over the last year. Don’t Miss Out: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!. As a member of Congress, Nancy Pelosi has to disclose the trades made by herself and her husband. In a Dec. 23, 2023 disclosure, the former Speaker of the House reported a purchase made before the Christmas holiday. The purchase was made on Nov. 22, 2023, for 50 call options in Nvidia, with a $120 strike price and an expiration date of Dec. 20, 2024. The disclosure listed the purchase price range of $1 million to $5 million. Unusual Whales pinned the purchase to a price of $1.8 million. Nvidia shares traded between $476.90 and $503.35 on Nov. 22, 2023, when the purchase was made. The call options would have been purchased for around $360 each. Fast forward to today and the options have changed after Nvidia conducted a 10-for-1 split in June 2024. The options contracts owned by the Pelosis are now 500 call options with a $12 strike price and an expiration date of Dec. 20, 2024. Trending: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. On Monday, these $12 call options traded at $132.05, valuing the Pelosis' position at $6,602,500. Based on the estimated cost basis of $1.8 million, the Pelosis are now up $4.8 million on this trade from last November. The options trade isn't the only one the Pelosis made over the last year. The former House Speaker also disclosed buying 10,000 NVDA shares on June 26, valued at $1 million to $5 million, and 10,000 NVDA shares on July 26, valued at $1 million to $5 million. Here's a look at those two purchases based on the intraday highs for Nvidia stock. June 26: 10,000 shares, $128.12 per share, purchase price $1,281,200, now worth $1,437,100 July 26: 10,000 shares, $116.20 per share, purchase price $1,162,000, now worth $1,437,100 The two purchases are now worth $2.87 million and up at least $430,000, depending on the timing of the purchases. Did You Know? Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Missed Profits?: While the Pelosis are now up over $5 million from their purchases of Nvidia stock and options over the last year, they could have been sitting on more profits if they hadn't sold shares back in July 2022. The sale happened after a disclosure of buying Nvidia shares ahead of the CHIPS Act, set to benefit semiconductor stocks, drew scrutiny and increased attention. In a filing, Pelosi reported selling 25,000 Nvidia shares at an average price point of $165.05. The total sale was valued at $4,126,250. The filing shows that the transaction was at a loss of $341,365. The 25,000 shares would now be 250,000 shares based on the stock split from earlier this year. Based on a price of $143.71 for Nvidia shares on Tuesday, the 250,000 shares would be worth $35,927,500. This means the Pelosis missed out on potential profits of $31,801,250 from their sale in July 2022. Nancy Pelosi says she does not share information on congressional activities with her husband. Observers remain skeptical, given the questionable timing of her disclosed trades. Pelosi’s annual salary falls between $174,000 and $197,000 as a senior member of Congress. When she served as Speaker of the House, her annual salary was $223,500. An ETF to track the stock trading activity of Democrats in Congress, the Unusual Whales Subversive Democratic Trading ETF (BATS:NANC), bears the Representative’s name in the stock ticker. Increased calls to ban Congress members and their spouses from trading have also centered on Pelosi, a Democrat. One bill even uses her name as an acronym: the PELOSI Act.NVDA Price Action: Nvidia shares closed at $143.71 on Monday, hitting new all-time highs. Nvidia stock is up 198% year-to-date in 2024.

Title: Gold Just Hit Its Highest Price Ever. It Might Not Stop.
URL: https://slate.com/technology/2024/10/gold-prices-record-breaking-investing-stock-market-crypto.html
Time Published: 2024-10-22T20:56:41Z
Full Content:
Don’t look now, but gold is back—in a big, big way. On Friday, the price of gold hit a record high, with U.S. gold futures reaching more than $2,700 an ounce and sticking around that threshold. And it’s finding newfound appeal among everyday American investors who’ve never turned to the stuff before. Gold is the big recommendation in bullish investor reports from Citibank, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase (the latter of which formerly had to pay nearly a billion dollars to the government for manipulating the precious metals markets). It’s plated over the highly overpriced Trump campaign watches and present in various other pieces of merch. It’s the hot new fashion statement for white guys, with gold chains draped around the necks of celebrities like Mark Zuckerberg and Justin Theroux. It was at the Republican National Convention. Its biggest advocates are going on tour with Tucker Carlson. It’s on the shelves of Costco, which, earlier this year, was reportedly selling up to $200 million worth of gold bars every month—and is now rapidly running out of the stuff. The precious metal is even a part of a revived business strategy for luxury watch brands, whose yellow-gold timepieces were the accessory of choice for Ryan Gosling in Barbie. Gold also frequently appears on the ads that sponsor the podcasts hosted by far-right conspiracists Charlie Kirk, Matt Walsh, and Candace Owens—and, yes, it’s also on Fox News and Newsmax. Beyond that, you can find even more on Rumble and on Truth Social, which will sell you everything from “free” gold bars to collectible gold coins featuring Trump’s mug shot to “info kits” on investing. There’s gold in Sen. Bob Menendez’s basement, and Sam Altman’s as well. No wonder we’re still mining for it under the hills of South Dakota. Gold has always been an American status symbol and object of fascination for doomsday preppers, evangelical end-timers, and right-wing commentators like Glenn Beck; it’s easy bait for older retirees, anxious about the savings they’ve built up throughout their life and alienated by the changing world around them, and it’s always been a sensible advertising choice for the types of radio stations and TV networks they tune in to. But this moment of peak hype is particularly notable, since we’re not in a typical climate for such a massive, extended precious metals surge. Gold and silver purchases (and their prices) usually shoot up during economic conditions that aren’t quite like the current one: eras of poor GDP outlooks, low interest rates, a weak U.S. dollar, and skittish investors and consumers. Still, keeping in line with the much-scrutinized economic weirdness of the past half-decade, gold has stayed lofty even as the economy booms, interest rates mostly remain high, consumer sentiment improves dramatically, and the dollar’s muscular value prevails. Usually, the price of gold is as reliable an indicator of economic orthodoxy as any other. But now it appears to be the outlier. And, irony of ironies, bitcoin has gone from stand-alone “digital gold” status and financial hedge to acting as just another commodity that swings with stock-market trends. As the Wall Street Journal explained earlier this year, a curious trend gripped the goldbug universe in the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic. Before then, most of the gold-curious got their hands on physical manifestations of the metal (jewelry, doubloons, etc.) but also expressed healthy interest in gold-backed exchange-traded funds, an easier and more virtual way of placing your monetary confidence in the metal. But in 2020, demand for both physical gold and ETFs reached an equivalent level—then diverged sharply in the years after, with physical gold reaching new heights and ETFs plunging squarely into the negative. Meaning: A lot of goldbugs lost their faith in the market model for gold trading and decided to ditch it in favor of the actual stuff. Understandable, considering how the apocalyptic vibes of the prevaccination era and the systemic effects of the shutdowns spurred more everyday consumers to keep gold as a safe backup and to hold on as things began to recover in jittery fashion. (Only recently did gold ETFs regain some of that lost demand.) Another significant trend of the 2021 recovery: Central banks began racking up gold bullion in droves as a hedge against the U.S. dollar, whose home government dithered on raising interest rates even as inflation started becoming an issue. The ensuing “de-dollarization” panic among emerging economies, heightened by the massive global impacts of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, made gold seem even more attractive for international reserves. The global economy was improving, sure, but also: Everything was chaotic, countries around the world saw their currencies lose their worth due to inflation, the United States and its dollar no longer seemed as sturdy as they once did, and wars were breaking out. Why wouldn’t nations like China, Singapore, India, Zimbabwe, Poland, and Turkey set aside some gold for themselves, as a treat? Financial analysts are effusively claiming that we’re hardly at the peak of the gold rally and could see even more records in the near future, as geopolitical nerves and distrust in institutions buoy mass interest in the metal. And when gold demand and prices go up on such a far-reaching scale, the ripple effects are unavoidable. Controversial, exploitative mines across West Africa open, or reopen, for business. Far-right propaganda outfits like the Epoch Times (notably run by Chinese expats) often include gold ads in their influence operations. Traders put off by the strange nature of this economic moment espouse gold’s stability on financial TV, just a few channels’ flip away from all the other right-wing outlets propped up by gold sponsors—which then point to messy current events to keep aged retirees scared and wondering whether anything is safe and stable anymore. Forget the meme stocks. Gold is forever. Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company. All contents © 2024 The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved.

The company has stopped any new development of the service, called Amazon Today, and will begin to wind it down, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The people asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the press. The bulk of the program will be shut down by Dec. 2, the people said. Select retail partners will be able to continue fulfilling orders with Amazon Today through Jan. 24, 2025, Amazon told CNBC. A small amount of employees will be laid off and provided with severance, while others will be transitioned to other positions within Amazon, the company said. Employees who work on Amazon Today learned the news in a meeting on Monday, where some staffers were informed they would be laid off, the people said. Roughly 300 employees were working on Amazon Today, the people said. Amazon disputed the figure, saying there were approximately 175 employees in the unit. The closure of Amazon Today is the latest example of the company's broader cost-cutting efforts.

Title: Amazon Earnings: Is The Stock A Buy Before Or After Reporting?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/amazon-amzn-stock-earnings-is-it-buy-before-after-earnings/
Time Published: 2024-10-22T19:15:30Z

Amazon's earnings should be out at the end of the month. Amazon (AMZN) stock is currently about 6% shy of its 52-week intra-day peak of $201.20 reached on July 8. Following a second-quarter revenue miss and less-than-rosy guidance for the third quarter, the stock closed at a low of $161.02 on August 5, but has staged a comeback ever since, closing Monday’s trade at $189.07. Although the strength in its cloud business–Amazon Web Services (AWS)–continues to cast a halo on the rest of its services, experts opine that Amazon may be ceding market share to Microsoft’s fast-growing cloud platform, Azure. The ballooning costs for Amazon’s ambitious Kuiper satellite internet project triggered an analyst downgrade on fears that it could slow down the pace of margin expansion. With third-quarter earnings slated for release on October 31, should investors buy into Amazon stock now, or wait to see how the earnings pan out? What are the metrics investors should look for in Amazon’s upcoming earnings print? What is the long-term outlook for Amazon stock? Amazon has outperformed earnings estimates over the last four quarters by a wide range of 18% to 59%. The highest beat was in the third quarter of last year. Sources: Company Press Releases, Seeking Alpha Amazon had a revenue miss in the most recent second quarter, following revenue beats in the previous three quarters. A beat by $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 marked the best revenue outperformance.

Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. Amazon is scheduled to release its third quarter results on October 31. Analysts expect Amazon to report EPS of $1.14 on revenues of $157.2 billion, representing increases of 21.3% and 9.9%, respectively, from year-ago numbers. Amazon guided third-quarter net sales to be between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, representing 8% to 11% growth from year-ago numbers of $143.1 billion. Since, the midpoint of this range was below the consensus estimate, the stock sank to a low of $161.02 on August 5. Although the stock has staged a nice recovery since then, it is yet to revisit its July 8 intraday high of $201.20. Amazon sees third-quarter operating income of $11.5 billion to $15 billion vs. year-ago $11.2 billion. In the third quarter of 2023, Amazon beat its own guidance, outperformed EPS estimates by a whopping 59% and revenue estimates by $1.6 billion, but the mid-point of its fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $160 billion to $167 billion fell below the consensus of $166.6 billion. Yet, the stock rallied 35% from its October 26, 2023 (third-quarter earnings release date) closing price of $119.57 to end trade at $161.26 on Jan 29, 2024 (just ahead of Amazon’s fourth-quarter earnings announcement on February 1). Amazon’s third-quarter results typically benefit from the Amazon Prime Day, a 48-hour shopping event held usually in July with excellent deals for shoppers seeking good bargains. Amazon’s upcoming third-quarter earnings print will include sales from the Prime Day 2024, which the online retail giant called “its biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales” but did not quantify. However, competition is catching up with Amazon’s revenue drive. The Prime Day has spurred other retailers to jump in with their promotions. Adobe Analytics estimates that online shoppers spent an estimated $14.2 billion across U.S. retailers in the July two-day period this year, up 11% from last year’s $12.7 billion. Amazon beat its own revenue guidance and analysts’ revenue estimates in three out of the last four quarters. A third-quarter earnings beat is likely in the cards, given Amazon’s EPS beats for four quarters in a row and just one miss over the past eight quarters. However, past performance holds no guarantees for the future. According to data from Synergy Research Group, which tracks IT and cloud data, Amazon remained the market leader among cloud providers during the June-2024 quarter with a 32% market share, followed by Microsoft at 23% and Google at 12%. Comparing this to December quarter numbers of 2020, AWS had a 31% market share vs. Azure’s 20% and Google Cloud’s 7%. Azure and Google Cloud have grown market share at a quicker pace since 2020, but not at the cost of AWS. It is also encouraging to see that second-quarter 2024 enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services rose 22% year over year to $79 billion worldwide, marking the third consecutive quarter of year over year growth of 20% or more, thanks to generative AI. As for revenues, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud group, which includes Azure revenue, reported $28.5 billion in revenue for the June quarter, up 19% year over year, while operating income for the segment rose to $12.9 billion, from $10.5 billion in the year-ago period. Amazon reported AWS sales of $26.3 billion, up 19% year over year. AWS operating income was $9.3 billion vs. year-ago $5.4 billion. Google Cloud reported sales of $10.3 billion up 29% from the year-ago period. Operating income for Google Cloud rose to $1.2 billion from $395 million last year. The catch here is Microsoft does not break out Azure dollar figures separately. So, it’s a bit complicated to understand Azure consumption. However, Microsoft has updated its reporting structure, under which the new Azure number is expected to now align more closely to its consumption business. This could pave the way for a better comparison process with AWS. Amazon stock is a bullish bet for the long term and here are factors that are expected to stimulate growth forward. Profitability has always been a sticky point with Amazon. The focus has been on growth vs. profits. Operating margins have never touched double digits until the first quarter of 2024, prior to which the best number was 8.2% for the first quarter of 2021. In the first quarter of 2024, operating margin rose to 10.7% from 7.8% in the fourth quarter, thanks to CEO Andy Jassy’s cost-cutting initiatives and stronger performance of higher-margin businesses like advertising and cloud computing. In the second quarter of 2024, operating margin was 9.9%. For the third quarter, operating margin is expected to be between 7.3% and 9.5% based on operating income guidance of $11.5 billion to $15 billion, on net sales of $154 billion to $158.5 billion. The resurgence in digital advertising amid the beginning of the Fed rate easing cycle and inflation moderating close to the Fed’s targets, should continue to power Amazon’s advertising revenues. Brands cut back on advertising spend in 2022, after inflation reached the highest levels in four decades and the Fed began to hike rates as an inflation reduction measure. Amazon’s ad revenues have grown more than 20% year over year during the last six quarters. For the first and second quarters of 2024, ad revenue increased 24% to $11.8 billion and 20% to $12.8 billion, respectively, year over year. In its June earnings call, Amazon said that it added more than $2 billion in advertising revenue year over year and generated more than $50 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months. The online ad business is small compared to Amazon’s online retail business, but growing at a solid pace, and will remain a key contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments. Amazon competes against Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet, which continue to dominate the digital ad space. Meta’s second-quarter sales, the bulk of which is generated from advertising, rose 22% year over year to $39.1 billion, while Google reported second-quarter ad sales of $64.6 billion, up 11% from the year ago period. Ad sales in the YouTube division rose 13% to $8.7 billion. Events like the Paris Olympics and elections in the U.S have fueled ad spending in 2024. Sponsored ads drive the majority of Amazon’s advertising revenue, while an expansion into Prime Video ads earlier this year will set the stage for future growth. Amazon is leveraging AI to improve the relevance of ads and in improving measures that allow brands to see the returns on their ad spend. Going forward, advertising on Prime Video will be an integral part of the digital ad business model, as it gives large advertisers a platform to pitch a product or service before a huge and growing audience. Amazon Prime Video viewership in September rose 12%—recording the strongest monthly growth in September among streaming platforms–thanks to Thursday Night Football and The Rings of Power, according to Nielsen, which specializes in audience measurement, data and analytics. However, Amazon will keep the ad loads lighter on Prime relative to linear TV and other streaming TV providers, as well as provide an ad-free streaming option for subscribers for an additional $2.99 per month. In 2025, Amazon plans to roll out Prime Video ads in Brazil, India, Japan, the Netherlands and New Zealand complementing its current presence in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico and Spain. Amazon is positioning AWS to serve the strong demand across both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads, as businesses migrate from on-premise infrastructure to the cloud amid robust enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services. AWS is at an annualized revenue run rate of more than $105 billion with second quarter revenue of $26.3 billion growing 18.8% year over year, accelerating from the 17.2% year over year growth in the first quarter, and 13% year over year growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. Thanks to Amazon’s cost discipline, AWS reported an operating margin of 35.5% for the June quarter vs. year-ago 24.2%. The AWS backlog was a whopping $156.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, up about 19% y-o-y. So, it is not surprising that Amazon’s capital investments for the second half of 2024, will be higher than the $30.5 billion it spent in the first half, and a bulk of that spending will be directed towards AWS infrastructure. Project Kuiper is Amazon’s ambitious initiative to establish a satellite internet network to provide high-speed internet to underserved and unserved regions globally, by launching 3,236 satellites into low Earth orbit. A new report from Space industry consultancy Quilty Space, says the costs for Project Kuiper may be spiraling way beyond Amazon’s estimate of $10 billion to a staggering $16.5 billion to $20 billion. While this may not seem particularly concerning in view of Amazon’s trailing 12-month free cash flow of $51.4 billion (adjusted for equipment finance leases), which has surged by 664% year-over-year–it remains a noteworthy figure. A more pressing challenge for Amazon is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license, which stipulates that at least half of the satellites need to be deployed by mid-2026. To comply with the FCC’s 2026 deadline, Amazon and its partners must push launch rates to unprecedented levels within the realm of private space operations. Quilty believes that the reliance of Amazon on all-new launch vehicles may also be an impediment to the launch, and Amazon may have to likely seek an extended timeline from the FCC. Even before Project Kuiper can get off the ground, it already has competition from Starlink, which has over 6,000 satellites in orbit. Starlink is a subsidiary of Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Despite SpaceX’s head-start advantage, there’s no stopping Amazon from making a market for itself. For one, AWS supports a third of the globe’s internet infrastructure, benefiting Kuiper with a pre-existing customer base unlike Starlink that had to build its subscriber base from ground up. Amazon launched its first two prototype satellites on October 6, 2023, and reported achieving 100% success. Amazon will begin deploying its satellite constellation in early 2025 and rolling out the commercial service later in the year. In its second-quarter earnings call, Amazon said that overall North America segment operating margin decreased slightly due to increased second-quarter spend in some investment areas, including Kuiper, kicking off a debate among analysts on Kuiper’s impact on operating margins. The concerns may appear slightly exaggerated because the North America segment operating margin for the second quarter was 5.6%, up 170 basis points year over year and down 20 basis points quarter over quarter. But the concerns are justified, as analysts estimate Kuiper spending to generate losses of up to $1 billion in the December quarter, up from $600 million in the second quarter. The losses could balloon to an estimated $5 billion to $6 billion next year, before the service starts to generate any meaningful revenue. However, Amazon declined to quantify the incremental investment for Kuiper in the second quarter earnings call. Investors can watch if it provides some color in the third-quarter earnings call. Quilty estimates that Kuiper can help Amazon generate $36 billion in annual revenues, if it can reach 100 million subscriptions at an average monthly ARPU [average revenue per user] of $30. The estimate appears quite conservative compared to the $4.2 billion in sales generated by Starlink's 2.3 million paying users in 2023, implying about $1,826 in ARPU. Amazon has secured partnerships with prominent telecom providers such as Verizon, Vodafone, and NTT, setting up Kuiper to deliver connectivity services for airplanes, ships, and other mobile platforms. According to the Quilty report, beyond Kuiper’s role as an internet service provider, If it can be positioned additionally as an alternative to Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and customized to deliver positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services, it could significantly enhance Kuiper’s value for military and commercial applications.

Amazon said its AI business is growing dramatically with a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate, although it is still in the early stages of growth. Where the tech leader has lagged in AI innovation, it is compensating by growing its own customized silicon - a grassroots technology that powers AI. Amazon’s homegrown AI chips Trainium for training AI models is witnessing significant demand, because it is more cost-effective than Nvidia’s chips and touted to deliver competitive performance. Amazon is not the new kid on the block when it comes to chipmaking. For years, it has been making Graviton chips for general purpose computing tasks. Amazon says its latest Graviton4 outperforms other x86 processors at 20% lower price points, while customers enjoy 40% to 50% price performance gains, use less electricity and improve carbon footprint. It was five years ago that AWS began to focus on developing AI processors, amid tight supply because there was primarily a single provider (implying Nvidia), and customer expectations for better price performance. Amazon built its own chip Trainium for training deep learning models, and Inferentia, its inference chip. In a recent development, startup Databricks plans to use Amazon’s Trainium AI chips in a service designed to help companies customize or create their own AI models, under a five-year deal between the two companies. This could cut costs for businesses seeking to build their own AI capabilities, because Amazon’s AI chips are cheaper. Amazon touts that its AI chips cost 40% lesser vs. other hardware offerings. Startup NinjaTech AI, which builds AI agents, uses Amazon’s Trainium processors. NinjaTech AI says it serves more than a million users a month at a cloud-services bill of about $250,000.month vs. the $750,000 to $1.2 million that would have been the cost had it deployed Nvidia’s GPUs. But Amazon has made it clear it will continue its partnerships with Nvidia, Intel and AMD, alongside offering its own processors for some differentiated capabilities, acknowledging that not all workloads will work better on its own processors. AWS plans to launch the next version of its Trainium processors by the end of this year. Amazon remains the largest online retailer in the U.S. and still generates a bulk of its revenues from its legacy retail business, which has come under pressure because of the exploding growth and popularity of Chinese shopping apps like Temu and Shein. Temu is an online marketplace operated by Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, while Shein is part of AliExpress, a China-based online retail service. Both Temu and Shein typically deliver products directly from manufacturers to American customers, at ultra-low price points, undercutting competition. Their growth is attributed mainly to a trading loophole called the 'de minimis' rule that exempts packages valued under $800 from custom duties and taxes. The rule has opened the floodgates for low-value deliveries, catapulting the volume of de minimis shipments to over a billion in 2023, from approximately 140 million in 2013, based on White House estimates. Each package has a value well below $800, making it eligible for the de minimis exemption. In June 2023, the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party released a report that noted that Temu and Shein alone are likely responsible for more than 30% of all packages shipped to the United States daily under the de minimis provision, and likely for nearly half of all de minimis shipments to the U.S. from China. The U.S. has proposed fresh regulations to address the misuse of the 'de minimis' rule and to eliminate the special customs exemption for the low-value Chinese shipments that currently face tariffs from the U.S. This includes 70% of textile and apparel imports from China, and other products like shoes, machinery, etc. potentially leading to a drastic reduction in the number of de minimis shipments. The proposal is yet to be finalized. Reports say that the EU is also exploring similar measures against low-value shipments. Amazon is reportedly considering its own direct-to-consumer business taking advantage of the de minimis rule, to sell items below $20. The prime day sale in July and the upcoming holiday-shopping season are also key near-term and perennial catalysts for Amazon’s retail business. Outlook for the fourth quarter will be a key metric to watch. In its earnings announcement, Amazon typically provides net sales and operating income guidance for the sequential quarter. The difference between buying a stock before it reports earnings and after is the distinction between a speculative investment decision and an informed one. Typically, stocks may experience wild stock swings around earnings announcements. The earnings of similar or related companies may also have a spillover impact on the stock price. Market mood plays a key role, as well. Market’s reaction to Amazon’s past earnings announcements may provide some clues. Sources: Yahoo Finance, Google AMZN stock lost nearly 9% of its value after it reported second-quarter earnings on August 1, 2024. So, a position after the earnings announcement would have been beneficial vs. a pre-earnings position. AMZN stock gained nearly 8% after reporting fourth-quarter earnings of fiscal 2023. Even if investors missed the opportunity to invest in the AMZN stock before the earnings announcement, the stock rallied another 10% in the post-earnings period and offered further buying opportunities. While not ideal, reduced gains are better than losses. No stock has a straight upward trajectory. It always provides several buy points along the way. So, buying after earnings reduces downside risk, while still providing gains, whereas pre-earnings purchase carries higher risk/reward. Any investing decision should be made after careful research and due diligence of the security in question, based on the risk appetite of the investors. Typically, if the stock rallies strongly ahead of earnings, it implies overwhelming optimism on the earnings outcome. This may also lead to overpricing of the stock. There is a strong likelihood that such stocks could reverse after the earnings announcement, unless the future guidance is extremely positive (in which case the momentum may likely continue). On the other hand, if a stock underperforms as it heads into earnings, it may imply muted earnings expectations or existing investors exiting or reducing positions ahead of earnings to avoid downside risks. In such a case, when the earnings announcement is positive, or not as negative as expected, shares tend to rally. Ahead of Amazon’s third-quarter earnings readout, Wedbush analysts believe that investors should take advantage of the Amazon stock’s relative underperformance, given Amazon’s accelerating AWS growth and the momentum of its high-margin advertising business that render the risk-reward attractive. On October 8, Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) bought 76,505 shares of Amazon worth around $14 million. AMZN stock is up 3.4% since then. ARKK has $5.5 billion in assets, and its five-year return of 12% is modest, at best vs. S&P 500’s 95% return in the same period. No analysts have a “sell” rating on AMZN stock, in fact 94% of analysts covering the stock are bullish about its prospects. An average price target of $219 represents nearly 16% upside from Monday’s close of $189.07. Less than 1% of the outstanding shares of AMZN is short, implying that investor sentiment is not negative. Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan expects Amazon’s third quarter earnings report to reflect relatively stable eCommerce demand, and strong performance in advertising, driven by the expansion of initiatives such as video, connected TV, and international markets, and solid U.S. eComm advertising growth. Sheridan expects continued acceleration for AWS, as previous headwinds such as the impact of cloud optimization.ease. The analyst reiterates a Buy rating and $230 price target on AMZN stock. Wedbush analysts reiterated an Outperform rating and $225 price target for the stock. Wedbush expects Amazon’s operating income to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate over the next five years, mainly due to its transition to higher-margin advertising, as well as AWS revenue. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Ken Gawrelski has downgraded AMZN stock from overweight to equal weight, trimming the price target from $225 to $183—one of Wall Street's most conservative projections. While AWS continues to thrive, it falls short of generating positive estimate revisions in the near future. Additional headwinds, including investments in Project Kuiper, rising pressures from Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fees, and moderating advertising contributions, are poised to cast a shadow on Amazon's earnings growth, according to the analyst. Analyzing Amazon's investment potential, particularly in the context of earnings announcements, leads to the conclusion that buying AMZN stock post-earnings may be a better approach. This way, investors can potentially mitigate downside risk and capitalize on asymmetric reward opportunities, benefiting from the latest financial disclosures and operational insights. Amazon Prime Day and Holiday shopping season are near-term catalysts for the retail business, while the proposal to regulate de minimis shipments may offer an enduring advantage against discount rivals. Amazon’s AI growth may likely stem from its home-grown AI chips that may attract businesses seeking improved price-performance options. Accelerating revenue growth, and a strong backlog, amid increased enterprise spending on infrastructure modernization will act as tailwinds for AWS. Despite all the concerns about Kuiper investment costs, the satellite-internet segment presents compelling economics for long-term growth, especially for Amazon with its pre-existing customer base. The impending rollout of Prime Video ads across additional markets, combined with a rise in viewership, is likely to bolster the high-margin online advertising business, and somewhat alleviate overall profitability growth concerns.

Title: Amazon Earnings: Is The Stock A Buy Before Or After Reporting?

Amazon's earnings should be out at the end of the month. Amazon (AMZN) stock is currently about 6% shy of its 52-week intra-day peak of $201.20 reached on July 8. Following a second-quarter revenue miss and less-than-rosy guidance for the third quarter, the stock closed at a low of $161.02 on August 5, but has staged a comeback ever since, closing Monday’s trade at $189.07. Although the strength in its cloud business–Amazon Web Services (AWS)–continues to cast a halo on the rest of its services, experts opine that Amazon may be ceding market share to Microsoft’s fast-growing cloud platform, Azure. The ballooning costs for Amazon’s ambitious Kuiper satellite internet project triggered an analyst downgrade on fears that it could slow down the pace of margin expansion. With third-quarter earnings slated for release on October 31, should investors buy into Amazon stock now, or wait to see how the earnings pan out? What are the metrics investors should look for in Amazon’s upcoming earnings print? What is the long-term outlook for Amazon stock? Amazon has outperformed earnings estimates over the last four quarters by a wide range of 18% to 59%. The highest beat was in the third quarter of last year. Sources: Company Press Releases, Seeking Alpha Amazon had a revenue miss in the most recent second quarter, following revenue beats in the previous three quarters. A beat by $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 marked the best revenue outperformance.

Amazon is scheduled to release its third quarter results on October 31. Analysts expect Amazon to report EPS of $1.14 on revenues of $157.2 billion, representing increases of 21.3% and 9.9%, respectively, from year-ago numbers. Amazon guided third-quarter net sales to be between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, representing 8% to 11% growth from year-ago numbers of $143.1 billion. Since, the midpoint of this range was below the consensus estimate, the stock sank to a low of $161.02 on August 5. Although the stock has staged a nice recovery since then, it is yet to revisit its July 8 intraday high of $201.20. Amazon sees third-quarter operating income of $11.5 billion to $15 billion vs. year-ago $11.2 billion. In the third quarter of 2023, Amazon beat its own guidance, outperformed EPS estimates by a whopping 59% and revenue estimates by $1.6 billion, but the mid-point of its fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $160 billion to $167 billion fell below the consensus of $166.6 billion. Yet, the stock rallied 35% from its October 26, 2023 (third-quarter earnings release date) closing price of $119.57 to end trade at $161.26 on Jan 29, 2024 (just ahead of Amazon’s fourth-quarter earnings announcement on February 1). Amazon’s third-quarter results typically benefit from the Amazon Prime Day, a 48-hour shopping event held usually in July with excellent deals for shoppers seeking good bargains. Amazon’s upcoming third-quarter earnings print will include sales from the Prime Day 2024, which the online retail giant called “its biggest Prime Day shopping event ever, with record sales” but did not quantify. However, competition is catching up with Amazon’s revenue drive. The Prime Day has spurred other retailers to jump in with their promotions. Adobe Analytics estimates that online shoppers spent an estimated $14.2 billion across U.S. retailers in the July two-day period this year, up 11% from last year’s $12.7 billion. Amazon beat its own revenue guidance and analysts’ revenue estimates in three out of the last four quarters. A third-quarter earnings beat is likely in the cards, given Amazon’s EPS beats for four quarters in a row and just one miss over the past eight quarters. However, past performance holds no guarantees for the future. According to data from Synergy Research Group, which tracks IT and cloud data, Amazon remained the market leader among cloud providers during the June-2024 quarter with a 32% market share, followed by Microsoft at 23% and Google at 12%. Comparing this to December quarter numbers of 2020, AWS had a 31% market share vs. Azure’s 20% and Google Cloud’s 7%. Azure and Google Cloud have grown market share at a quicker pace since 2020, but not at the cost of AWS. It is also encouraging to see that second-quarter 2024 enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services rose 22% year over year to $79 billion worldwide, marking the third consecutive quarter of year over year growth of 20% or more, thanks to generative AI. As for revenues, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud group, which includes Azure revenue, reported $28.5 billion in revenue for the June quarter, up 19% year over year, while operating income for the segment rose to $12.9 billion, from $10.5 billion in the year-ago period. Amazon reported AWS sales of $26.3 billion, up 19% year over year. AWS operating income was $9.3 billion vs. year-ago $5.4 billion. Google Cloud reported sales of $10.3 billion up 29% from the year-ago period. Operating income for Google Cloud rose to $1.2 billion from $395 million last year. The catch here is Microsoft does not break out Azure dollar figures separately. So, it’s a bit complicated to understand Azure consumption. However, Microsoft has updated its reporting structure, under which the new Azure number is expected to now align more closely to its consumption business. This could pave the way for a better comparison process with AWS. Amazon stock is a bullish bet for the long term and here are factors that are expected to stimulate growth forward. Profitability has always been a sticky point with Amazon. The focus has been on growth vs. profits. Operating margins have never touched double digits until the first quarter of 2024, prior to which the best number was 8.2% for the first quarter of 2021. In the first quarter of 2024, operating margin rose to 10.7% from 7.8% in the fourth quarter, thanks to CEO Andy Jassy’s cost-cutting initiatives and stronger performance of higher-margin businesses like advertising and cloud computing. In the second quarter of 2024, operating margin was 9.9%. For the third quarter, operating margin is expected to be between 7.3% and 9.5% based on operating income guidance of $11.5 billion to $15 billion, on net sales of $154 billion to $158.5 billion. The resurgence in digital advertising amid the beginning of the Fed rate easing cycle and inflation moderating close to the Fed’s targets, should continue to power Amazon’s advertising revenues. Brands cut back on advertising spend in 2022, after inflation reached the highest levels in four decades and the Fed began to hike rates as an inflation reduction measure. Amazon’s ad revenues have grown more than 20% year over year during the last six quarters. For the first and second quarters of 2024, ad revenue increased 24% to $11.8 billion and 20% to $12.8 billion, respectively, year over year. In its June earnings call, Amazon said that it added more than $2 billion in advertising revenue year over year and generated more than $50 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months. The online ad business is small compared to Amazon’s online retail business, but growing at a solid pace, and will remain a key contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments. Amazon competes against Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet, which continue to dominate the digital ad space. Meta’s second-quarter sales, the bulk of which is generated from advertising, rose 22% year over year to $39.1 billion, while Google reported second-quarter ad sales of $64.6 billion, up 11% from the year ago period. Ad sales in the YouTube division rose 13% to $8.7 billion. Events like the Paris Olympics and elections in the U.S have fueled ad spending in 2024.

However, Amazon will keep the ad loads lighter on Prime relative to linear TV and other streaming TV providers, as well as provide an ad-free streaming option for subscribers for an additional $2.99 per month. In 2025, Amazon plans to roll out Prime Video ads in Brazil, India, Japan, the Netherlands and New Zealand complementing its current presence in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico and Spain.

In a recent development, startup Databricks plans to use Amazon’s Trainium AI chips in a service designed to help companies customize or create their own AI models, under a five-year deal between the two companies. This could cut costs for businesses seeking to build their own AI capabilities, because Amazon’s AI chips are cheaper. Amazon touts that its AI chips cost 40% lesser vs. other hardware offerings. Startup NinjaTech AI, which builds AI agents, uses Amazon’s Trainium processors. NinjaTech AI says it serves more than a million users a month at a cloud-services bill of about $250,000.month vs. the $750,000 to $1.2 million that would have been the cost had it deployed Nvidia’s GPUs. But Amazon has made it clear it will continue its partnerships with Nvidia, Intel and AMD, alongside offering its own processors for some differentiated capabilities, acknowledging that not all workloads will work better on its own processors. AWS plans to launch the next version of its Trainium processors by the end of this year. Amazon remains the largest online retailer in the U.S. and still generates a bulk of its revenues from its legacy retail business, which has come under pressure because of the exploding growth and popularity of Chinese shopping apps like Temu and Shein. Temu is an online marketplace operated by Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, while Shein is part of AliExpress, a China-based online retail service. Both Temu and Shein typically deliver products directly from manufacturers to American customers, at ultra-low price points, undercutting competition. Their growth is attributed mainly to a trading loophole called the 'de minimis' rule that exempts packages valued under $800 from custom duties and taxes. The rule has opened the floodgates for low-value deliveries, catapulting the volume of de minimis shipments to over a billion in 2023, from approximately 140 million in 2013, based on White House estimates. Each package has a value well below $800, making it eligible for the de minimis exemption. In June 2023, the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party released a report that noted that Temu and Shein alone are likely responsible for more than 30% of all packages shipped to the United States daily under the de minimis provision, and likely for nearly half of all de minimis shipments to the U.S. from China. The U.S. has proposed fresh regulations to address the misuse of the 'de minimis' rule and to eliminate the special customs exemption for the low-value Chinese shipments that currently face tariffs from the U.S. This includes 70% of textile and apparel imports from China, and other products like shoes, machinery, etc. potentially leading to a drastic reduction in the number of de minimis shipments. The proposal is yet to be finalized. Reports say that the EU is also exploring similar measures against low-value shipments. Amazon is reportedly considering its own direct-to-consumer business taking advantage of the de minimis rule, to sell items below $20. The prime day sale in July and the upcoming holiday-shopping season are also key near-term and perennial catalysts for Amazon’s retail business. Outlook for the fourth quarter will be a key metric to watch. In its earnings announcement, Amazon typically provides net sales and operating income guidance for the sequential quarter. The difference between buying a stock before it reports earnings and after is the distinction between a speculative investment decision and an informed one. Typically, stocks may experience wild stock swings around earnings announcements. The earnings of similar or related companies may also have a spillover impact on the stock price. Market mood plays a key role, as well. Market’s reaction to Amazon’s past earnings announcements may provide some clues. Sources: Yahoo Finance, Google AMZN stock lost nearly 9% of its value after it reported second-quarter earnings on August 1, 2024. So, a position after the earnings announcement would have been beneficial vs. a pre-earnings position. AMZN stock gained nearly 8% after reporting fourth-quarter earnings of fiscal 2023. Even if investors missed the opportunity to invest in the AMZN stock before the earnings announcement, the stock rallied another 10% in the post-earnings period and offered further buying opportunities. While not ideal, reduced gains are better than losses. No stock has a straight upward trajectory. It always provides several buy points along the way. So, buying after earnings reduces downside risk, while still providing gains, whereas pre-earnings purchase carries higher risk/reward. Any investing decision should be made after careful research and due diligence of the security in question, based on the risk appetite of the investors. Typically, if the stock rallies strongly ahead of earnings, it implies overwhelming optimism on the earnings outcome. This may also lead to overpricing of the stock. There is a strong likelihood that such stocks could reverse after the earnings announcement, unless the future guidance is extremely positive (in which case the momentum may likely continue). On the other hand, if a stock underperforms as it heads into earnings, it may imply muted earnings expectations or existing investors exiting or reducing positions ahead of earnings to avoid downside risks. In such a case, when the earnings announcement is positive, or not as negative as expected, shares tend to rally. Ahead of Amazon’s third-quarter earnings readout, Wedbush analysts believe that investors should take advantage of the Amazon stock’s relative underperformance, given Amazon’s accelerating AWS growth and the momentum of its high-margin advertising business that render the risk-reward attractive. On October 8, Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) bought 76,505 shares of Amazon worth around $14 million. AMZN stock is up 3.4% since then. ARKK has $5.5 billion in assets, and its five-year return of 12% is modest, at best vs. S&P 500’s 95% return in the same period. No analysts have a “sell” rating on AMZN stock, in fact 94% of analysts covering the stock are bullish about its prospects. An average price target of $219 represents nearly 16% upside from Monday’s close of $189.07. Less than 1% of the outstanding shares of AMZN is short, implying that investor sentiment is not negative. Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan expects Amazon’s third quarter earnings report to reflect relatively stable eCommerce demand, and strong performance in advertising, driven by the expansion of initiatives such as video, connected TV, and international markets, and solid U.S. eComm advertising growth. Sheridan expects continued acceleration for AWS, as previous headwinds such as the impact of cloud optimization.ease. The analyst reiterates a Buy rating and $230 price target on AMZN stock. Wedbush analysts reiterated an Outperform rating and $225 price target for the stock. Wedbush expects Amazon’s operating income to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate over the next five years, mainly due to its transition to higher-margin advertising, as well as AWS revenue. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Ken Gawrelski has downgraded AMZN stock from overweight to equal weight, trimming the price target from $225 to $183—one of Wall Street's most conservative projections. While AWS continues to thrive, it falls short of generating positive estimate revisions in the near future. Additional headwinds, including investments in Project Kuiper, rising pressures from Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fees, and moderating advertising contributions, are poised to cast a shadow on Amazon's earnings growth, according to the analyst. Analyzing Amazon's investment potential, particularly in the context of earnings announcements, leads to the conclusion that buying AMZN stock post-earnings may be a better approach. This way, investors can potentially mitigate downside risk and capitalize on asymmetric reward opportunities, benefiting from the latest financial disclosures and operational insights. Amazon Prime Day and Holiday shopping season are near-term catalysts for the retail business, while the proposal to regulate de minimis shipments may offer an enduring advantage against discount rivals. Amazon’s AI growth may likely stem from its home-grown AI chips that may attract businesses seeking improved price-performance options. Accelerating revenue growth, and a strong backlog, amid increased enterprise spending on infrastructure modernization will act as tailwinds for AWS. Despite all the concerns about Kuiper investment costs, the satellite-internet segment presents compelling economics for long-term growth, especially for Amazon with its pre-existing customer base. The impending rollout of Prime Video ads across additional markets, combined with a rise in viewership, is likely to bolster the high-margin online advertising business, and somewhat alleviate overall profitability growth concerns. For the long term, Amazon stock remains a compelling buy.

Title: Ford is paying dealers $20K+ to order 2024 F-150 Lightning trucks

Posted on 10/22/2024 12:05:12 PM PDT by Red Badger A mysterious "cooling EV sentiment" has affected nearly every automaker, and even Ford’s once white-hot electric pickup truck may be starting to feel the burn. As dealers struggle to sell remaining 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning models, Ford is inventing new ways to move metal. One way is by introducing Retail Replenishment Centers (RRCs), locations dedicated to holding inventory to manage flooring costs and space for dealers. Ford is enticing dealers to “buy now,” and dealerships can earn up to $22,500 per month by ordering trucks from the RRC. Ford hopes to move more electric trucks with dramatic dealer incentives According to a new memo circulating the web, Ford is offering dealers up to $1,000 per unit when they restock their Lightning inventory via the RRC. But, that figure creeps up to $1,500 each when the dealer orders nine or more units – up to a maximum of 15. Since Ford has offered to pay retroactively to the first unit, that means a total of $22,500 is sitting on the table. The program will run from October 15 until November 15 of this year, and Ford says it’s a win-win situation. Dealers can save space while still offering shoppers the same or more flexibility in the model they choose. It could backfire; some dealerships may take advantage of the rebate only to find that it simply doesn’t make sense to normally have the Lightning in stock. That could diminish choices for shoppers – and competition for Lightning-stocked Ford dealers. Almost every 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning is eligible for the rebate No need for dealers or shoppers to pick and choose, either. Eligible trim levels include the XLT, Flash, Lariat, and Platinum trim levels of the 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning. That’s every trim level that Ford currently offers, sans the work-truck spec F-150 Lightning Pro. As the least-expensive trim in the Lightning stable, it’s currently reserved for fleet sales – and not generally eligible for retail sale. Limited Lightnings on the lot could be a bad thing There are potential downsides to this strategy. Ford dealers might realize that having one or two Lightnings on the lot is more than enough. So, customers might have a lot more limited options when arranging test drives. Potential customers that want to touch and feel the exact product before buying may be driven elsewhere, too. Generally, the pros should outweigh the cons - driving dealers to offer more attractive pricing and hopefully motivating dealers behind the times to start pushing EVs a little more seriously. The extra rebate makes a 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning an even more attractive proposition. As of this writing, 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning offers are already extensive. Ford offers 0 percent financing for up 60 months – and a very competitive 1.9 percent for 72-month terms. That’s nearly unheard of, thanks to where today’s interest rates currently sit. Customers that lease don’t really have the same incentives on hand, but they’d probably be happy to save the extra $1,000 or $1,500 where they can. They also still benefit from Ford's commitment - the “Ford Power Promise” - to cover install costs on Level 2 chargers for EV buyers. Final thoughts Paying dealers to take vehicles usually is not a very good sign. But it’s important to take a look at the full picture. Ford sold a record number of EVs in Q3 of 2024. Their EV sales expanded 45 percent year-over-year, making them second only to Tesla in US EV sales for the year. Perhaps they’re looking to keep the gravy train rolling in the face of – at least what’s being touted as – waning consumer sentiment. Or, they’re just making room for the 2025s – at any cost. Whatever the case, it might be the best time yet to pick up a Lightning if you’re looking.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Red Badger Even EV drivers have problems taking the Lightning on trips. With the extended range battery at 131kWh, lets say you pull up to a charger with 20% left and charge up to 80%. That's 79 kWh. You'd be good to get out of there in half an hour at the fastest chargers. Driving 75 mph on the highway (with no load), you'd probably get a real world range of 170 miles before you stop another 30 minutes to charge. One of many reasons a full size EV pickup is impractical. As opposed to an EV car (smaller battery, better miles per kWh) charging in 15 minutes every 200 miles. A little pre-planning with trips with plenty of chargers (i.e. up and down the eastern seaboard like I did this past summer), means driving and charging an EV is about as fast as driving and filling up a gas car (at least as often as my wife wants to stop and stretch her legs LOL). So we're able to compare charging prices with gas prices on those trips and pick which of our two cars is cheapest to drive (EV car or gas pickup). But even with that, an EV is practical only if you drive enough miles for the gas savings to be worth it, can charge at home, have two cars so that one car can be a gas car for the times an EV won't do, and don't drive much in the northern cold winter. Anyone who doesn't meet all of those criteria shouldn't consider an EV. That's from a free market and practical standpoint. Not from the warmageddon-cult-government-should-incentivize-or-force-everyone-to-drive-EVs perspective like the Dims do. 16 posted on 10/22/2024 12:53:34 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

A little pre-planning with trips with plenty of chargers (i.e. up and down the eastern seaboard like I did this past summer), means driving and charging an EV is about as fast as driving and filling up a gas car (at least as often as my wife wants to stop and stretch her legs LOL). So we're able to compare charging prices with gas prices on those trips and pick which of our two cars is cheapest to drive (EV car or gas pickup). But even with that, an EV is practical only if you drive enough miles for the gas savings to be worth it, can charge at home, have two cars so that one car can be a gas car for the times an EV won't do, and don't drive much in the northern cold winter. Anyone who doesn't meet all of those criteria shouldn't consider an EV. That's from a free market and practical standpoint. Not from the warmageddon-cult-government-should-incentivize-or-force-everyone-to-drive-EVs perspective like the Dims do. 16 posted on 10/22/2024 12:53:34 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson According to a new memo circulating the web, Ford is offering dealers up to $1,000 per unit when they restock their Lightning inventory via the RRC. But, that figure creeps up to $1,500 each when the dealer orders nine or more units – up to a maximum of 15. Since Ford has offered to pay retroactively to the first unit, that means a total of $22,500 is sitting on the table. The program will run from October 15 until November 15 of this year, and Ford says it’s a win-win situation. Dealers can save space while still offering shoppers the same or more flexibility in the model they choose. It could backfire; some dealerships may take advantage of the rebate only to find that it simply doesn’t make sense to normally have the Lightning in stock. That could diminish choices for shoppers – and competition for Lightning-stocked Ford dealers. Almost every 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning is eligible for the rebate No need for dealers or shoppers to pick and choose, either. Eligible trim levels include the XLT, Flash, Lariat, and Platinum trim levels of the 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning. That’s every trim level that Ford currently offers, sans the work-truck spec F-150 Lightning Pro. As the least-expensive trim in the Lightning stable, it’s currently reserved for fleet sales – and not generally eligible for retail sale. Limited Lightnings on the lot could be a bad thing There are potential downsides to this strategy. Ford dealers might realize that having one or two Lightnings on the lot is more than enough. So, customers might have a lot more limited options when arranging test drives. Potential customers that want to touch and feel the exact product before buying may be driven elsewhere, too. Generally, the pros should outweigh the cons - driving dealers to offer more attractive pricing and hopefully motivating dealers behind the times to start pushing EVs a little more seriously. The extra rebate makes a 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning an even more attractive proposition. As of this writing, 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning offers are already extensive. Ford offers 0 percent financing for up 60 months – and a very competitive 1.9 percent for 72-month terms. That’s nearly unheard of, thanks to where today’s interest rates currently sit. Customers that lease don’t really have the same incentives on hand, but they’d probably be happy to save the extra $1,000 or $1,500 where they can. They also still benefit from Ford's commitment - the “Ford Power Promise” - to cover install costs on Level 2 chargers for EV buyers. Final thoughts Paying dealers to take vehicles usually is not a very good sign. But it’s important to take a look at the full picture. Ford sold a record number of EVs in Q3 of 2024. Their EV sales expanded 45 percent year-over-year, making them second only to Tesla in US EV sales for the year. Perhaps they’re looking to keep the gravy train rolling in the face of – at least what’s being touted as – waning consumer sentiment. Or, they’re just making room for the 2025s – at any cost. Whatever the case, it might be the best time yet to pick up a Lightning if you’re looking.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Red Badger Even EV drivers have problems taking the Lightning on trips. With the extended range battery at 131kWh, lets say you pull up to a charger with 20% left and charge up to 80%. That's 79 kWh. You'd be good to get out of there in half an hour at the fastest chargers. Driving 75 mph on the highway (with no load), you'd probably get a real world range of 170 miles before you stop another 30 minutes to charge. One of many reasons a full size EV pickup is impractical. As opposed to an EV car (smaller battery, better miles per kWh) charging in 15 minutes every 200 miles. A little pre-planning with trips with plenty of chargers (i.e. up and down the eastern seaboard like I did this past summer), means driving and charging an EV is about as fast as driving and filling up a gas car (at least as often as my wife wants to stop and stretch her legs LOL). So we're able to compare charging prices with gas prices on those trips and pick which of our two cars is cheapest to drive (EV car or gas pickup). But even with that, an EV is practical only if you drive enough miles for the gas savings to be worth it, can charge at home, have two cars so that one car can be a gas car for the times an EV won't do, and don't drive much in the northern cold winter. Anyone who doesn't meet all of those criteria shouldn't consider an EV. That's from a free market and practical standpoint. Not from the warmageddon-cult-government-should-incentivize-or-force-everyone-to-drive-EVs perspective like the Dims do. 16 posted on 10/22/2024 12:53:34 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

Eligible trim levels include the XLT, Flash, Lariat, and Platinum trim levels of the 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning. That’s every trim level that Ford currently offers, sans the work-truck spec F-150 Lightning Pro. As the least-expensive trim in the Lightning stable, it’s currently reserved for fleet sales – and not generally eligible for retail sale. Limited Lightnings on the lot could be a bad thing There are potential downsides to this strategy. Ford dealers might realize that having one or two Lightnings on the lot is more than enough. So, customers might have a lot more limited options when arranging test drives. Potential customers that want to touch and feel the exact product before buying may be driven elsewhere, too. Generally, the pros should outweigh the cons - driving dealers to offer more attractive pricing and hopefully motivating dealers behind the times to start pushing EVs a little more seriously. The extra rebate makes a 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning an even more attractive proposition. As of this writing, 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning offers are already extensive. Ford offers 0 percent financing for up 60 months – and a very competitive 1.9 percent for 72-month terms. That’s nearly unheard of, thanks to where today’s interest rates currently sit. Customers that lease don’t really have the same incentives on hand, but they’d probably be happy to save the extra $1,000 or $1,500 where they can. They also still benefit from Ford's commitment - the “Ford Power Promise” - to cover install costs on Level 2 chargers for EV buyers. Final thoughts Paying dealers to take vehicles usually is not a very good sign. But it’s important to take a look at the full picture. Ford sold a record number of EVs in Q3 of 2024. Their EV sales expanded 45 percent year-over-year, making them second only to Tesla in US EV sales for the year. Perhaps they’re looking to keep the gravy train rolling in the face of – at least what’s being touted as – waning consumer sentiment. Or, they’re just making room for the 2025s – at any cost. Whatever the case, it might be the best time yet to pick up a Lightning if you’re looking.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Red Badger Even EV drivers have problems taking the Lightning on trips. With the extended range battery at 131kWh, lets say you pull up to a charger with 20% left and charge up to 80%. That's 79 kWh. You'd be good to get out of there in half an hour at the fastest chargers. Driving 75 mph on the highway (with no load), you'd probably get a real world range of 170 miles before you stop another 30 minutes to charge. One of many reasons a full size EV pickup is impractical. As opposed to an EV car (smaller battery, better miles per kWh) charging in 15 minutes every 200 miles. A little pre-planning with trips with plenty of chargers (i.e. up and down the eastern seaboard like I did this past summer), means driving and charging an EV is about as fast as driving and filling up a gas car (at least as often as my wife wants to stop and stretch her legs LOL). So we're able to compare charging prices with gas prices on those trips and pick which of our two cars is cheapest to drive (EV car or gas pickup). But even with that, an EV is practical only if you drive enough miles for the gas savings to be worth it, can charge at home, have two cars so that one car can be a gas car for the times an EV won't do, and don't drive much in the northern cold winter. Anyone who doesn't meet all of those criteria shouldn't consider an EV. That's from a free market and practical standpoint. Not from the warmageddon-cult-government-should-incentivize-or-force-everyone-to-drive-EVs perspective like the Dims do. 16 posted on 10/22/2024 12:53:34 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

As of this writing, 2024 Ford F-150 Lightning offers are already extensive. Ford offers 0 percent financing for up 60 months – and a very competitive 1.9 percent for 72-month terms. That’s nearly unheard of, thanks to where today’s interest rates currently sit. Customers that lease don’t really have the same incentives on hand, but they’d probably be happy to save the extra $1,000 or $1,500 where they can. They also still benefit from Ford's commitment - the “Ford Power Promise” - to cover install costs on Level 2 chargers for EV buyers. Final thoughts Paying dealers to take vehicles usually is not a very good sign. But it’s important to take a look at the full picture. Ford sold a record number of EVs in Q3 of 2024. Their EV sales expanded 45 percent year-over-year, making them second only to Tesla in US EV sales for the year. Perhaps they’re looking to keep the gravy train rolling in the face of – at least what’s being touted as – waning consumer sentiment. Or, they’re just making room for the 2025s – at any cost. Whatever the case, it might be the best time yet to pick up a Lightning if you’re looking.

Not from the warmageddon-cult-government-should-incentivize-or-force-everyone-to-drive-EVs perspective like the Dims do. While the design appearance is interesting, it is still impractical for what I need. Does she go to Starbucks every morning? Never has as far as I know!................... Does she have 10 cats?

Full Content:
Fiserv, Inc. (FISV) has reported a robust performance in its third quarter of 2024, with significant increases in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and revenue. The company announced adjusted EPS of $2.30, a 17% rise, and a 7% increase in adjusted revenue, reaching $4.9 billion. The adjusted operating margin improved to 40.2%, and organic revenue growth was a strong 15%. Fiserv's Merchant Solutions and Financial Solutions segments experienced substantial organic growth, contributing to a free cash flow of $1.9 billion for the quarter. Strategic developments, such as partnerships with DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and the growth of the Clover platform, have positioned the company for sustained growth. Fiserv raised its full-year organic revenue growth guidance to 16%-17% and adjusted EPS expectations to $8.73-$8.80. Fiserv's third-quarter results demonstrate a company on the rise, with strategic partnerships and innovative initiatives paving the way for future success. The company's management remains confident in their growth trajectory, supported by strong performance indicators and a clear vision for expansion, both domestically and internationally. As Fiserv continues to execute its strategy, the market will be watching closely to see how these plans unfold in the coming quarters. Fiserv's robust third-quarter performance is further underscored by key metrics and insights from InvestingPro. The company's market capitalization stands at an impressive $114.18 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the financial services industry. This aligns with the InvestingPro Tip that Fiserv is a "prominent player in the Financial Services industry." The company's revenue growth of 7.2% over the last twelve months, as reported by InvestingPro, is consistent with the 7% increase in adjusted revenue mentioned in the earnings report. This steady growth trajectory is complemented by a strong gross profit margin of 60.96%, indicating efficient cost management and pricing power. Fiserv's profitability is evident in its adjusted operating income of $5.387 billion and an operating income margin of 27.23% for the last twelve months. This robust profitability supports the InvestingPro Tip that the company has been "profitable over the last twelve months" and that "analysts predict the company will be profitable this year." The stock's performance has been particularly noteworthy, with InvestingPro data showing a one-year price total return of 72.38% and a year-to-date return of 49.78%. This exceptional performance is captured by the InvestingPro Tip highlighting the "high return over the last year" and that the stock is "trading near 52-week high," with the price at 98.98% of its 52-week high. While Fiserv's P/E ratio of 34.14 suggests it's "trading at a high earnings multiple," the PEG ratio of 0.72 indicates it may be undervalued relative to its growth prospects. This is further supported by the InvestingPro Tip that Fiserv is "trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth." For investors seeking more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Fiserv, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position. Operator: Welcome to the Fiserv Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Julie Chariell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Julie Chariell: Thank you, and good morning. With me on the call today are Frank Bisignano, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to the earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. And now, I'll turn the call over to Frank. Frank Bisignano: Thank you, Julie, and thank you all for joining us today. As we share our third quarter results this morning, it is increasingly clear that our position at the intersection of merchant and financial solutions is a strategic advantage. Fiserv delivered another strong quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $2.30, up 17%, driven by strong revenue growth and further operating margin expansion across our businesses. Adjusted revenue growth was 7% and adjusted operating margin rose 170 basis points to 40.2%. Organic revenue growth was 15%. Our free cash flow was $1.9 billion in the quarter and $3.3 billion year-to-date, and we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchase. Businesses and financial institutions are increasingly interconnected, and Fiserv has a key role to play here given our unmatched set of assets across software, data, technology and, of course, scale and experience in moving money. Here are two examples in just the past month. First, we announced this morning with DoorDash, we began implementing a comprehensive embedded finance application poised to be a best-in-class solution for gig economy company. This solution enables DoorDash to offer its delivery contractors a full range of financial services. Within a single app, they can get instant access to wages and rewards, as well as deposit accounts, debit cards and more. Our real-time ledger capability from Finxact manages the transactions and was a key reason why Fiserv was chosen. A Fiserv banking client rounded out the solution as a requisite sponsor. Second, we completed a proof of concept with Walmart where we enabled a real-time Pay by Bank transaction at the point of sale over our proprietary NOW Network. A growing number of merchants are adding Pay by Bank capability to maximize choice for consumers and the emerging capacity for handling such payments in real time offers advantages for Fiserv, merchants and consumers. This capability will be more widely available next year via our NOW Network. Additionally, we teamed up with Walmart Business as a referral partner for Clover as a business management platform, helping Walmart fulfill its goal of helping small businesses and non-profits to better run their businesses. In a separate but related testament to our product strength and position as a partner of choice, today Inc. magazine named Clover to its 2024 Power Partners list, which recognizes the best B2B providers for SMBs. Let me share some of the many highlights of the quarter. It was another strong quarter of growth in the Merchant Solutions segment, with organic revenue up 24%. At Clover, revenue grew 28% and value-added services penetration reached 21%, up 1 percentage point from Q2. In Latin America, we expanded the friends and family Clover pilots in Brazil and Mexico as planned with a full-scale launch coming in December. In Asia Pacific, we went live with our first Clover pilot in Australia in September. We also enabled the Enterprise Commerce Control Center, which allows merchants to monitor and analyze their business and transaction performance across locations, regions and operating segments in a single view. In Financial Solutions, we posted another quarter of strong organic revenue growth at 6%. The build out of CashFlow Central was completed in September and we have our first client gearing up to implement the solution in the next few months. And we continue to migrate clients to Experience Digital, or XD, our new digital banking solution, as we integrate additional solutions into this unique digital ecosystem, including CashFlow Central, real-time payments, Clover and more. We expect to see a multiplying effect on the average revenue per XD user over time. It was another quarter of marquee wins that demonstrate the power of Fiserv's integrated and value-added offerings. We were chosen to provide merchant acceptance services for a major e-com marketplace and expanded our long-standing partnership with Costco (NASDAQ:COST) to launch a stored value digital wallet. The service enables new payment and reward redemption experiences whether the retailer's customers are shopping online or in the warehouse. We continue to sign other enterprise merchants onto our value-added solutions. Another long-time enterprise client, Exxon (NYSE:XOM), signed on for a data-as-a-service offering. This solution is used to extract insights from integrated vendor, payments, consumer loyalty and wallet data. And because it runs in a cloud, we can reduce implementation time from months to days. Also in Q3, Ahold Delhaize, a global retailer whose portfolio includes Stop & Shop in the U.S. selected Fiserv as the provider of Pay by Bank services. Alex Lee, a large privately owned operator of multiple food companies, chose our Smart Routing technology for debit cost efficiency. We accelerated our signings of financial institutions as merchant acquirer referral partners. These included banks of all sizes as well as credit unions. Golden 1 Credit Union and America First Credit Union were two of the larger signings in Q3. In our three regions, we continue to see strong client momentum. We expanded our partnership with Netto, a major grocery chain in Europe. We'll provide several value-added services, including dynamic currency conversion, customer cashback and encryption solutions, in addition to supplying thousands of new PIN pads to accelerate transaction speed across their 700 stores in Poland. In Asia Pac, Fiserv was chosen by foodpanda, a subsidiary of Delivery Hero and one of the world's leading local delivery companies, to provide payment services across multiple markets in Asia. This strategic partnership spans online, mobile and digital wallets, positioning Fiserv as foodpanda's primary acquirer in Singapore and Hong Kong, processing over $1 billion in annual spend. We launched Clover Sport at Bombonera in Argentina. This is one of the country's largest soccer stadiums and home to one of the top teams in the league. Clover's presence there can add to awareness in the region. To optimize the fan experience for fast and easy concession services, the stadium, through our ISV partner, chose the Clover platform to accept payments in three ways: through QR codes, self-service kiosks and mobile handheld devices. Moving to the Financial Solutions segments, four banks signed on for CashFlow Central in the past three months, including our first credit union for a total of 10 since we announced the initiative a year ago. AvidXchange will be using the CheckFree biller directory to support faster bill payment on its mid-market B2B exchange. In September, we won a competitive bid with Farm Credit Mid-America, a cooperative that reaches across six states. We'll be converting their loan portfolio to DNA and integrating several other value-added solutions. PNC signed up for our AI-enabled Advance Defense product for enhanced fraud detection in their card issuing business. Equitas Small Finance Bank was the latest India issuer to go live on our India processing hub, successfully launching a new retail and corporate card product with a full-stack offering, including loyalty, offers and real-time fraud management, as well as credit on UPI, India's real-time account-to-account payment system. And we continue to build our capability here as a market leader with seven of the 10 largest credit card issuers in India on our platform. In September, we hosted 3,000 Fiserv clients and prospects at our annual Client Conference forum. This group of attendees represent nearly 50% of our North American institutional revenue across the Merchant and Financial Solutions segments and nearly 60% of our new business pipeline through 2025. After three days of demos across 75 booths in our Experience Center, over 100 well-attended product and technology information sessions and thousands of client meetings, we strengthened our relationships and partnerships, expanded our pipeline of opportunities and generated enthusiasm for our offerings, setting the stage for continued strong growth in the future. One of the many highlights at Forum this year was our SMB bundle. The premise behind this suite of products is that small- and medium-sized businesses have a complex landscape to navigate for managing their businesses and they prefer a single easy-to-use system. With our own products and partnerships, Fiserv is the only financial technology expert with solutions that cut across the entire SMB value chain. Since the products and the clients for our SMB bundle span our Merchant and Financial Solutions segments, we have the unique opportunity to win business through the integration of solutions across both of our ecosystems. From our merchant ecosystem, we provide acceptance and processing, the Clover POS platform, Clover VAS, including vertical and horizontal business process software, capital, loyalty and gift solutions and the Small Business Index for localized insights. From our financial ecosystem, we provide CashFlow Central because cash management is a fundamental requirement for business success at SMBs. We also provide Optis for business card issuance, SpendTrack for expense management, Zelle for small business and core banking account management and digital banking. While we sell each of these separately now, next year, they will be integrated on our leading platforms. For FIs, the SMB bundle will integrate into digital banking environment such as Fiserv's Experience Digital or XD platform. For small businesses, the SMB bundle will integrate into the Clover Dashboard and be sold through all Clover channels. Lastly, I want to come back to something I said last quarter. Merchant-related services from Fiserv are back as an opportunity for financial institutions to compete and win. What's old is new again based on our innovations across the SMB bundle. It gives FIs a deeper view into an SMB's full financial position. With this knowledge and breadth of product, they can better grow and retain SMB clients and generate deposit and non-interest fees. We couple this capability with tools to help FIs readily find merchant customer leads and onboard them digitally. Showcasing our integrated SMB capabilities generated a lot of interest and ongoing engagement and we expect the SMB bundle to start contributing to growth next year. Turning to our guidance for the rest of the year, we are raising organic revenue growth from 15% to 17% to 16% to 17%, and raising our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to $8.73 to $8.80. As I look across all the new initiatives we are rolling out, I am pleased with how the vision and investment we put into motion five years ago has brought Fiserv to a strong position today, one that's clearly hard to replicate. The results show that we are executing on mandates for each of our two ecosystems, merchants and financial institutions. This will continue in many ways as we add to our Clover portfolio, extend services to enterprise merchants, expand issuing to new verticals and geographies, enable more real-time payments, modernize core banking systems, add partners, grow internationally, and continue to use distribution data and more. With this foundation of leadership and steady growth firmly established, we are moving to the next generation of solutions that answers the needs across both ecosystems. As the only provider serving both merchants and financial institutions with product breadth and technological scale we serve at the intersection between merchants and fintech, issuers and fintechs, acquiring and cash management, digital wallets and card services, spending and banking data, and many other combinations. This is not a vision. It is here today in our initiatives with DoorDash, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Walmart, U.S. Bank, Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) and others. Of course, these integrated opportunities are in their early stages. As excited as we are about them today, our measure of success will be strong sustainable growth for Fiserv over the medium and longer term. And now, I will turn it over to Bob for more detail on our financial performance. Bob Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good morning everyone. If you are following along on our slides, I will cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Third quarter, again, demonstrated our capability to maintain strong revenue growth and margin expansion. Third quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 7% to $4.9 billion and adjusted operating income grew 12% to $2 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 40.2%, an increase of 170 basis points versus the prior year. Year-to-date, adjusted revenue grew 7% to $14.2 billion and adjusted operating income grew 12% to $5.4 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 38.2%, an increase of 170 basis points versus the prior year. Organic revenue grew 15% in the quarter, driven by strength in both segments. The transitory contribution from excess inflation in Argentina was 3 points to our total organic growth in the quarter, down from 5 points in Q2. As mentioned during last quarter's earnings call, dólar turista extended into Q3 and contributed less than 0.5 point of total company organic growth in the quarter. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.30 compared to $1.96 in the prior year, up 17% on the high end of our full year guidance provided last quarter of 15% to 17%. Year-to-date, our adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $6.29 compared to $5.34 in the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion, and year-to-date free cash flow was $3.3 billion. As mentioned in prior earnings calls, we expected free cash flow to be much higher in the second half of this year after a lighter first half due to the timing of cash flows for the green tax credit program. The related refund came through in the third quarter. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Slide 5, organic revenue growth in the Merchant Solutions segment was 24% in the quarter and 29% year-to-date. This includes a 6 point benefit from above-average inflation in Argentina in the quarter and a 10 point benefit year-to-date. While inflation remains high, interest rates in Argentina eased in late second quarter and are back to historical averages and, therefore, did not contribute to excess growth this quarter. The continuation of dólar turista contributed nearly 1 percentage point to Merchant organic revenue growth in the quarter and 3 points year-to-date. On Slide 6, we have again included a summary of the impact of excess Argentine inflation and interest on total Fiserv and Merchant segment revenue along with the offsetting headwind from currency devaluation, which impacts adjusted revenue. Adjusted revenue growth for Merchant Solutions was 9% in the quarter and 10% year-to-date. The quarterly results include a 15 percentage point currency headwind largely from the Argentine peso after a sharp devaluation in late December last year. Similar to Q2, the currency headwind to adjusted revenue growth was much higher than the inflation and interest tailwind in the quarter. 2024 has been an outstanding year for new Clover hardware launches. Earlier this year, we brought to market the Kitchen Display System, or KDS XL, to manage orders and improve efficiency in a 24-inches formfactor that larger restaurants demand. We also launched the Kiosk, which allows for self-service ordering, reducing wait times and increasing average tickets. In Q3, we introduced a new version of the Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) handheld device called the Flex Pocket, which is 25% lighter, 50% thinner and oriented towards restaurant and waitstaff in retail. And most recently, we launched the Clover Compact, an entry-level solution that will help drive TAM expansion and create new VAS revenue opportunities. Now moving to the business lines. Small business organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 25% and 9%, respectively, on payment volume growth of 4%. This volume growth was similar to Q2 levels. According to a variety of external macro indicators, overall consumer spending growth is slower than last year, but appears stable at a comfortable pace. Fiserv's small business performance was ahead of our Small Business Index results, which showed year-over-year sales volume growth of 2.3% compared to 3.7% for Q2 and 2.8% for Q3 2023. The difference is likely attributable to our international presence and a slightly different mix of business. Fiserv is more heavily weighted to non-discretionary categories such as food and services, which have been growing faster. Clover revenue grew 28% in the third quarter on an annualized payment volume growth of 15%. VAS penetration increased sequentially by 1 point to 21% in Q3, driven by growth in Clover Capital and the Clover SaaS package. In Q4, we will be rolling out new vertical software plans for retail and services. With this progress, we remain on track to achieve our 2026 Clover targets of $4.5 billion in revenue and VAS penetration of 27%. Enterprise organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 37% and 17%, respectively, driven by transactions growth of 12% and higher VAS penetration. As with small business, organic growth in enterprise includes some transitory benefit in Argentina. Above-average growth in enterprise business reflects the ramping of a large PayFac from our processing customer to a direct client. Commerce Hub continues to see ongoing traction and is now processing almost 7 times the daily transactions versus Q1 and 2 times when compared to Q2. And clients are increasingly connected to enhanced solutions. Much of the Commerce Hub transaction growth comes from existing clients migrating to the Commerce Hub and the fact that they are now on the platform gives us the opportunity to sell more VAS going forward. Finally, processing organic revenue in the quarter declined by 1%, while adjusted revenue decreased 2%. This business represents the back-end processing we do for our bank and certain ISO partners where they own the merchant relationship. Year-to-date processing organic and adjusted revenue growth were both flat, consistent with our expectation. Adjusted operating income in the Merchant Solutions segment increased 19% to $931 million in the quarter, with adjusted operating margin up 290 basis points to 37.7%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income increased 22% to $2.6 billion, with adjusted operating margin up 330 basis points to 36.2%. As noted in prior quarters, interest expense from anticipation revenue is recorded below the operating income line. If the interest costs from anticipation were included in the operating income, Merchant adjusted operating margins would have expanded 190 basis points for the quarter and 260 basis points year-to-date. Turning to Slide 7, on the Financial Solutions segment, organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter and year-to-date, in line with our full year outlook of 5% to 7%. Looking at the business lines, digital payments organic and adjusted revenue each grew by 5% in the quarter. Growth in Zelle transactions continue to be strong at 35%. We continue to see demand from clients for digital payments products such as FedNow and RTP integrations. CashFlow Central, our integrated AR/AP solution for SMBs, continues to see high interest from financial institutions. In the last three months, we signed two nearly-$10 billion institutions Amarillo National Bank and Tri Counties Bank. In total, we had four wins in the last three months, bringing the total to 10 since product announcement. In issuing, organic and adjusted revenue grew 7% and 4%, respectively, in the quarter, driven by demand across various verticals, including government and healthcare. During the quarter, we converted the remaining HealthEquity HSA and FSA card accounts to Optis, our issuing processing platform, solidifying our leadership in the healthcare card vertical. Banking organic and adjusted revenue grew 5% in the quarter. Last quarter, we spoke about signing a merchant agreement with Connecticut On-Line Computer Center, known as COCC, which is a client-owned provider of banking technology. In the third quarter, we expanded our relationship to include Experience Digital, or XD, which is our online and mobile banking solution. XD will now be available to the 150 community banks and credit unions on COCC solution. Third quarter adjusted operating income for the Financial Solutions segment was up 5% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating margin came in strong at 47.4%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income for the segment was up 6% to $3.2 billion, with adjusted operating margin up 60 basis points to 45.8%. Now, let me wrap up with some remaining details on the financials. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $112 million in the quarter and $394 million year-to-date, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.8% and 19.0% year-to-date. We expect the full year rate to be slightly below 20%. Total debt outstanding was $25.3 billion on September 30. Our debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio went down from 2.8 times in the second quarter to 2.7 times in the third quarter, in line with our target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 8 million shares for $1.3 billion, bringing our total cash return to shareholders for the last 12 months to $5.3 billion and over $16 billion since the 2019 merger. We had 24 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Turning to Slide 9, as Frank said earlier, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $8.73 to $8.80, up from $8.65 to $8.80. This is an acceleration in forecasted adjusted EPS growth to 16% to 17% from 15% to 17%. This is also a $0.04 raise at the midpoint from prior guidance and $0.14 from our original guidance. We are raising our 2024 organic revenue growth outlook from 15% to 17% to 16% to 17%. Additionally, we are raising our adjusted margin expansion outlook from more than 135 basis points to at least 150 basis points. Lastly, we are updating our free cash flow guidance from about $4.7 billion to above $4.7 billion, driven by the strong free cash flow in the third quarter and year-to-date. Given the current environment in Argentina, we continue to assume 4 points of benefit from excess inflation and interest this year for the total company and 9 points for Merchant Solutions. We now see the dólar turista program continuing into the fourth quarter, but easing through the end of the year. Our full year outlook of 16% to 17% total company organic growth includes a 4 point transitory benefit from inflation and interest in Argentina and just over 1 point of growth from dólar turista. Excluding these combined transitory factors, 2024 organic revenue growth would be 11% to 12% at the upper end of our medium-term guidance of 9% to 12%. The forecasted impact from foreign currency exchange remains 8.5% and we anticipate will continue to be a stronger though declining headwind to adjusted revenue growth relative to the tailwind from excess inflation and interest. Finally, in the past month, we made progress on three items that many of you have been asking about over the last month. While these do not have an outsized impact on our financials given the scale of our business, they demonstrate our ability to navigate ongoing change in our business in a way that is not disruptive and always open to opportunity. First, as previously reported, we expect Wells Fargo to take ownership of our 40% owned joint venture Wells Fargo Merchant Services on April 1, 2025, at which time, we will receive cash or assets for our portion of the business. Fiserv will continue to provide processing services to Wells' existing and new merchants along with other related services. As a result, we see no change to our medium-term outlook of 9% to 12% adjusted revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted EPS growth from this transaction. Secondly, we extended our merchant processing joint venture with PNC for the fifth time. The relationship dates back to 1996, supporting PNC small business and enterprise clients with hardware and processing services from Fiserv and we expect Clover to have a growing presence from here. And third, the State of Georgia approved our application for a merchant acquirer limited purpose bank charter. This approval from the state allows Fiserv to apply for direct acceptance into the card networks and is anticipated to be operational in 2025. This is a special purpose charter that enables optionality for sponsorship for merchant acquiring. It's important to clarify that Fiserv is not becoming a bank. Fiserv will not open branches, take deposits or write loans as traditional banks do. We have no intention in doing that and in fact the charter itself does not permit these traditional banking activities. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks. Frank Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our corporate social responsibility initiatives, not because these are investment parameters, but because they represent who we are as a company. Hurricanes Helene and Milton were devastating for millions of people and businesses, including many Fiserv clients. Our response, as always, is to take action and we quickly sent support to the Red Cross and personally delivered supplies to the affected areas. As part of our partnership with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and our investment to support its disaster preparedness and recovery effort for small businesses, we provided the Chamber with Fiserv Small Business Index data on the impact of the hurricanes. These granular insights on commerce levels leading up to, during and after these natural disasters are being used to educate policymakers and stakeholders, guide targeted response investments and inform philanthropic support efforts that create and boost small business recovery. Also in the quarter, Fiserv achieved a score of 100 on the Disability Equality Index and was recognized as a Top Veteran-Friendly Company by US Veterans Magazine, each for the third year in a row. The National Bankers Association, a trade organization that represents all minority depository institutions, presented Fiserv with its Corporate Excellence Award, making us the first large-scale tech provider to receive this honor. Finally, we continue to advance our sustainability and green building design strategy. Our Milwaukee headquarters recently achieved LEED Gold status following our Dublin, Ireland and New Jersey Innovation Centers, which achieved LEED Platinum status previously. These are just some examples of how our hard work and dedication show up in many quarters, but most importantly, it showed up in the strong financial performance you just heard. This put us at the top of the IDC FinTech Rankings for a second straight year, and our story today is about how we intend to stay there. I'd like to thank our more than 40,000 employees for their contributions to these significant achievements and for the day-to-day blocking and tackling that has produced consistently strong results. That's 40 years of building trust, scale and experience, and five years since the merger of achieving innovation through unmatched investment across our merchant and financial ecosystems. So, now, operator, please open the lines for questions. Operator: Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tien-Tsin Huang: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the update here. I want to ask on enterprise. It did accelerate nicely more than the transaction growth that you put up there. So, I heard, Bob, you mentioned it was transitory part of it and then there was a PayFac conversion to a retail relationship, it sounds like. So, can you just maybe go through that and what's a good sustainable level as we think about the fourth quarter? Bob Hau: Yeah, Tien-Tsin, good morning. So, you're right, we did see an increase in transactions. Transaction growth in the quarter was up 12% over prior year. That actually matches what we saw in Q1. It's up from the 8% we saw in Q2. We definitely see some variation, particularly when we bring on new clients, some of them in this enterprise space can be quite large. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we did have a large PayFac begin to really ramp in the third quarter. We will see a little bit of that continue in fourth quarter as they get to full capability or full volume, and then it will return to "more normal levels." Overall for that business line, we obviously saw very good organic growth, well ahead of the overall company average on an adjusted basis, which again that has also impact from Argentina in it. We feel great about the year-to-date at 11% on an adjusted basis. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Darrin Peller: Guys, thanks. And nice results. Can we just start with -- overall the business is showing really strong signs of cross-sell. And I know, Frank, you alluded to that in your prepared remarks and how you're really packaging together more and more between segments. Maybe just some very specific examples of where you see that shaping up? And then, just if you could reiterate your conviction around the Financial Solutions segment accelerating into '25. I think you said going to 6% to 8% from 5% to 7%. Just reiterate why and what the driving force is and what you're seeing? Thanks, guys. Frank Bisignano: So, I'd like to go back to something I'd like to say the construction of the company, right? I always believe that this was a very strategic set of assets we put together that were highly complementary five years ago. And one quick place to think about it is in merchant and FI, just in total, our ability to be the strategic partner of choice to deliver merchant and FI and put Clover on the front end of that. And then, really there is the power of owning a debit network and the ability of what to bring to our largest institutions and to our client base across merchants. And then, you go a step further and the future of the growth initiatives in terms of us talking about the SMB bundle and the ability to take all the assets we have and integrate them technically now, right? You see us on the front line there with Apple Pay and then you can see us with issuers in another spot and then see us weaving the place together and the ability of the crossroads of merchants and FIs, I think Walmart is a great example of it. I think DoorDash is a great example of it, right? And so, then you think about, okay, you got Finxact, you're bringing Finxact in as a [handless core] (ph) to be actually a ledger here for the famous Dashers. And then you go, okay, you put XD and Clover together and deliver a capability to every financial institution that runs on us. And you take a look at our international expansion and you look at the work on Commerce Hub, now showing up in the enterprise segment. So, I think the construction of the company with financial institutions all the way through from the largest to a credit union or a local community bank, and then you take on top of that the assets we bring to it. So, I mean, you're seeing it and then we brought 3,000 people to forum and I think you were there, too, if I am right. And I mean you saw the power of the franchise first-hand. So, we think that's why we see such sustainable growth for the long term, and we always think we can do our job better, too. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Harshita Rawat: Hi, good morning. Frank, can you talk about STAR and Accel, especially given some of the changes happening in the U.S.? Maybe talk about their PINless capabilities [indiscernible] Signature capabilities, how STAR is positioned to grow? Thank you. Frank Bisignano: Yeah. So, I think one of the things to think about is we always believe that we wanted the capability to compete for transactions for our client benefit, right, for our client benefit. And that window opens up. STAR/Accel is clearly a strategic asset to sit at the crossroads of merchants and financial institutions. We believe our capability is strong on PIN. We have the signature capability. We do have dual-messaging capability. And we give our merchants and issuers choices to compete for transactions at every level. So, that's the strategy, right? The strategy is to support our client base. We believe it too is one of these steady opportunity you're not going to see this meteoric rise of transactions, but you'll continue to see volume share gains and we'll continue to have an asset in our repertoire to help both our merchants and our financial institutions. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions on Clover. I know revenue growth was steady here, volume growth ticked down a little bit. Just any thoughts on Q4 expectations for those metrics? I think the volume comps get a little bit harder, revenue also next quarter. So, just wanted to get a sense of how we should be thinking about near-term trajectory there. I know you've got some new country launches, product launches to support it. Bob Hau: Yeah, Jason, good morning. So, yes, we continue to see good overall revenue and volume growth out of our Clover solution. As you know, we've got a target to be $4.5 billion by 2026. That gets us where we needed about the 28% compound growth rate to achieve that. It's exactly where we were for the quarter. It's where we are on a year-to-date basis. A key part of that is continuing to add value-added services that ticked up 1 point to 21% of revenue. Overall, volume remains good. It obviously isn't as strong as it was last year. Some of that is very strong last year. So, a little bit of a difficult comp, but also the consumer, while still strong, still spending, has certainly eased a bit. We saw that last quarter. We saw that continue again this quarter. But we feel good about where that spending is right now and what we see going into the future. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Koning: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks. Good job. I guess, my question, in the SMB segment, for many quarters, you had kind of teens growth, kind of 13% to 17%. This quarter was 9% despite Clover being in the high-20%s for many quarters in a row. So, maybe what -- kind of what's happening outside of Clover, and then how should we expect that to reaccelerate going forward, or maybe just kind of talk through that? Bob Hau: Yeah. So, there's a number of things going on. Obviously, Argentina tailwind has eased quite meaningfully since last year beginning of this year even where we saw in first quarter, 15% benefit to the Merchant segment, easing down in second quarter to 10%, now down to 6%. And that impacts both, actually all three of our segments, but certainly a good portion of SMB volume -- excuse me, SMB revenue. The other thing that does play out is anticipation has been quite strong and there is a mix differential between -- or benefit differential between SMB and enterprise. We've seen particular strength out of the large enterprises down in Argentina. We see that kind of shifting a bit into the next couple of quarters. A bit difficult to predict exactly what's going to happen into Argentina in the future. I think we've gotten it pretty right over the last several quarters and we see that excess or that tailwind continuing to ease. You may have noticed in our presentation and our charts, inflation continues to be a tailwind, although easing meaningfully, but interest has actually returned back to more normal or historic levels. And so that tailwind is subsiding quite meaningfully. And then, of course, if you get to an adjusted revenue basis, FX continues to be a real headwind for us in the quarter for the segments. For the Merchant segment, we saw 15 point impact -- negative impact to our adjusted revenue from FX. So, all of those play out in SMB, both in Clover and non-Clover. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Tim Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead. Tim Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I also want to revisit the Financial Solutions revenue guidance for next year, which is set to slightly accelerate, so from 5% to 7% this year to 6% to 8% next year. When we think about the reasons, there appears to be a good long list of very clear bullets. So, there's the Target business, there's Desjardins, there's Verizon. I believe all of those are expected to go live with their incremental revenue streams next year. And then, of course, there's the CashFlow Central. So, I was hoping you could touch on or maybe elaborate on any of those particular projects and/or maybe just talk a little bit about the confidence that you have in that reacceleration for next year? Frank Bisignano: Yeah. So, I think, we were greatly reinforced only a couple of weeks ago at our Client Conference where you heard me talk about the added pipe, the added interest and the amount of opportunity we see to grow our client base. That was not unexpected. That was exactly what we expected for the outcome. Today, on a year-to-date basis, we're a 6% grower as we were in the quarter. I think when you think about the repertoire, Finxact is growing clients right now, and that will continue to add. You saw us talk about what we're doing with DoorDash, that's creating another fundamental, as I use in my simple language, bundle, which is embedded finance, right? Then, you look at this SMB bundle, which I am being deep in every other week reviews for over a year. So, my conviction on the depth of that pipeline will be bringing that online and will be within the numbers. We talk about merchant and FI, but -- and that merchant part shows up in the merchant P&L, but the reality is that also is bringing along other opportunity within the banking segment. And then, we do and we'll continue to have opportunities even within the banking segment outside the U.S. that we see more of than we did before because of the nature and the construct of this company. And you tapped on the items that -- you touched on the items that we're bringing in. I'd add one other one. We believe our long-term opportunity around AI and data for our financial institutions, what I said to medium-sized to smaller banks, we need to be their data and AI engine. And that's our natural position with them. Now, that's not in forecast today. We don't have a number in a box, but we have demand and we have the best data in the industry and data drives AI. So, I would think about it that the fact we're posting a 6% and we have these engines behind us has such conviction of what we could do. And we can do all of it better as I say every day just in the base business. So that's why we've been able to produce at the level we have -- even if you look at our five-year margin, look what we've done there, and I'm not saying we're going to have never-ending margin expansion, but I sure work on it regularly. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Dan Dolev from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Dan Dolev: Hey, guys. Great results again. Frank, Clover Go and Clover Compact, they look like great solutions from micro sellers. Can you maybe give us a little bit of an update on the strategy and in terms of initial traction that you see on these new products? Thank you. Frank Bisignano: Yeah. We also see those products as augmentation products for our client base, right? So, I just want you to think about that way we talk about our ability to expand TAM in our own client base by bringing more. We definitely see the Compact playing in the food space. Obviously, we're early, but you should also think about international, right, that we're going to be bringing those products outside the U.S. in many cases, where, yes, we will still have software and VAS on top of them, but they may be catering to a different market. And we're going to have different forms of channel distribution. So, it gets us more software coming down a little bit [scale] (ph) in terms of merchant, but also augmenting our current client base to have a product that can work a little more mobile for them at times, too. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette: Thank you so much. I wanted to follow-up on the SMB bundle and this ties a little bit into Dan's question, but it seems like there's a lot of capability expansion that's happening within the Clover ecosystem and then looking at new ways to go to market. How should we be thinking about -- I know you gave some targets for back book and some of those things to get to the $4.5 billion target, but how should we be thinking about like the roles that those will play and if there's been any change in your thinking in terms of mix or type of customers and such within that Clover target? Thank you. Frank Bisignano: Yeah. I know there's only one question allowed, but that's like five. Good job, James. Let me try it. Like first of all, in some ways, there's not really -- inside this company that there's a ton of new thought. We always have a lot of R&D going on that historically and the IR team don't always love me for it, but they're more apt to talk to you about when we're getting to market than what's in the R&D shop. So, this idea about us bringing more capability to the SMB space has always been there. I think if you go back to our acquisition of Ondot and us embedding it in Mobiliti and then it became let's think about XD and a new product, but then you start saying to yourself, we could deliver this way beyond Clover and XD, we can integrate it all, we can put out Spendlabs acquisition there. Oh boy, we could end up helping LFI's grow and other channel partners and future partners to be signed up. That's why we are ultimately a partner of choice for people who want to partner in the SMB space because of our capability. So, I think you got to think about it that, yes, there may be more back book swept up in there because there's a reason beyond switching out your FD150 for a Clover station, now you have a much broader capability. None of this back book, if it happened, was ever more than our natural kind of rate, which we talked about of merchant churn going from an older device to a newer. But I think you're seeing the size of the opportunity to actually impact Clover more than we might have because of the full capability set. Thank you. I think you're on the right track there. Operator: Thank you. And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. On Clover international expansion, how long does it take to ramp a new country or region from the time you enter the market to when you reach peak run rate? And also, should we expect sort of a steady rhythm of new markets for a while here, or are you going to kind of -- should we expect some pauses where you build out and sort of spool up in the countries you've already launched in? Frank Bisignano: Yeah. So, I'm a funny guy. I think we're going to get to peak run rate never because we're just going to keep driving more. So, that's kind of the journey we're on. But if you want to pick a country like Brazil, right, I'll be down there on the kick-off of it in December for the launch in Brazil and Mexico. I remember us launching Argentina, call it, four years ago. So, first of all, it's the full build to get to market. As we launch it, we expect it in Brazil, perfect example, to capture more merchants and more revenue opportunities than we do today immediately. Now, our ability to scale at the peak, we have great partners. I think if you were sitting with our Head of Latin America, he would say Caixa is very motivated. Well, that's a huge distribution. Now, we're going to get them trained. They are doing that right now and ready to distribute. So, it affects growth rate in '25, but I see Brazil as a multiyear build and a multiyear ramp. Not because we weren't able to get to all the zip codes or towns, if you want to think about it, but adoption. And then, so it's a multiyear ramp. But much like CashFlow Central of Brazil is in next year's number at some level, nowhere near where it'll be three years from now. So, I'd like to thank everybody for your attention today. Please reach out to our IR team with any further questions. And have a great day, and thanks for your participation. Operator: Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today's call. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.

Title: Kamala Harris Has More Billionaires Prominently Backing Her Than Trump—Steve Ballmer, Jamie Dimon Weigh In (Update)

Time Published: 2024-10-22T17:52:57Z
Full Content:
Forbes found at least 100 billionaires in the corners of either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris—with many more backing Harris—but unlike the world’s richest man Elon Musk, who stumps extensively on Trump’s behalf, many have elected to watch from the sidelines, like Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg. Trump and Harris during their September presidential debate. Our breakdown records 81 billionaires supporting Harris and 50 backing Trump so far (see the lists for both below). Many more billionaires may still financially back a candidate, but their donations won’t be learned until after the election, when final Federal Election Commission reports are issued in December. Billionaires leaning toward Harris may seem incongruous, since she often criticizes Trump for advocating for policies favorable toward billionaires—but there are practical reasons why the ultra wealthy may favor Harris. A letter signed by more than a dozen billionaires last month endorsing Harris explained their belief Harris “will continue to advance fair and predictable policies that support the rule of law, stability, and a sound business environment,” indicating the support for the status quo as the U.S. economy and stock market exhibit strength, while a recent survey of millionaire investors—which found a 57% to 43% split in Harris’s favor—identified technology, healthcare and sustainability stocks as the sectors most poised to benefit from a Harris win, a mix friendly to many of her billionaire backers from Silicon Valley, who grew familiar with Harris during her time as a California prosecutor. Forbes will update this list through Election Day. Jeff Bezos, left, Larry Page, second from left, Sheryl Sandberg, former chief operating officer of ... [+] Facebook, then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence and then-President-elect Donald Trump meet in 2016. Bill Gates: Though his ex-wife French Gates is among Harris’ deepest backers—her reported $13 million donation to Harris groups would place her among the top individual donors this cycle—the Microsoft cofounder Gates has not officially endorsed a candidate, but appeared to offer positive words toward Harris in a July interview, saying it is “great to have somebody who's younger, who can think about things like AI and how we shape that in the right way.” But “I don’t tell other people how to vote” due to his work with his nonprofit Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates added. UPDATE (Oct. 22): Gates told allies he donated $50 million to the non-profit wing of a Democratic political action committee supporting Harris, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the situation. The bombshell report goes against Gates’ history of public nonpartisanship. Though Gates did not confirm the donation to the Times, he hinted at his Harris backing in a statement, saying he supports “candidates who demonstrate a clear commitment to improving health care, reducing poverty and fighting climate change” and “this election is different” than those of the past. Jamie Dimon: Trump shared a false social media post touting Dimon’s endorsement, but the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, did not endorse any candidate, according to his spokesperson. Still, some see hints in Dimon’s words. He’s been outspoken about the election, penning an opinion in The Washington Post calling on voters “to elect a president who is dedicated to the ideals that define and unite us.” UPDATE (Oct. 22): The Times reported Dimon has privately endorsed Harris and has indicated he’s open to a role in her administration, including the top economic role of Treasury secretary. Dimon spokesman Joe Evangelisti told the Times the banker “has never publicly endorsed a presidential candidate.” Dimon’s wife, Judith Kent, has donated more than $250,000 to Democratic causes in 2024 through the couple’s joint The James and Judith K Dimon Foundation, according to Federal Election Commission filings. A source close to Dimon told Forbes that the JPMorgan chief is not considering a role in either a Harris or Trump administration. Steve Ballmer, UPDATE (Oct. 22): Ballmer, the owner of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers and former chief executive of Microsoft, made clear in an interview with Forbes last week he will not endorse a candidate, though he has shelled out more than $40 million to his not-for-profit company USAFacts to arm the public with easily accessible government data. “At some point all the money does is help bid up the price of ads on Facebook,” Ballmer bemoaned to Forbes about the impact traditional political spending can have. Connie Ballmer, the wife of the world’s 10th-richest person, has donated more than $300,000 to Democratic causes this year, according to government records, but “I don't control my wife and would never want to,” Steve Ballmer added about what that indicates about his own leanings. Jeff Bezos: The Amazon founder and world’s fourth-richest man wrote Trump “showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire” following the assassination attempt at a July 13 rally, but Bezos has not endorsed or financially backed, even though he has publicly warred with Trump during his presidency. He celebrated Biden’s election in 2020 with an Instagram post noting the Biden win indicated “unity, empathy, and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era.” Warren Buffett: Though Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett said in 2020 he’s a Democrat and clapped back at Trump in 2016 for an income tax jab, Buffett, the world’s sixth-richest person, has also stayed quiet this cycle. UPDATE (Oct. 23): Berkshire released a statement Wednesday that Buffett won’t publicly “endorse and support political candidates.” Buffett explained to CNBC he’s “worried about people impersonating” him and “nobody should believe anybody saying I’m telling them how to...vote.” Mark Zuckerberg: Trump told New York Magazine that Zuckerberg said to him he can’t “vote for a Democrat in this election” after the assassination attempt. But a Meta spokesperson said Zuckerberg, the third-wealthiest person on the planet, is “not endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.” In 2020, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan donated $419 million toward organizations supporting in-person voting during the pandemics. The Meta CEO and Facebook cofounder called Trump’s response to the assassination attempt “badass” in a July interview. Ray Dalio: Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, told CNBC last month it’s the “most consequential” election of his, but he won’t endorse Harris or Trump as he desires a more moderate candidate. Sergey Brin: The Google cofounder and eighth-wealthiest person in the world Brin said following the 2016 election he found Trump’s election “deeply offensive” as an immigrant, according to an internal video leaked in 2018, but has not made public any feelings during this cycle. Larry Ellison and Ken Griffin: Ellison and Griffin are perhaps the most surprising billionaires who have stayed quiet in the final months of the presidential election cycle considering both have donated millions to Republican causes in the past. Griffin (Citadel) confirmed Thursday he has not financially backed Trump, adding he’s “torn” and won’t vote with a “smile on my face” as both candidates aren’t “going to receive an award for the quality of their policies” or “the quality of their leadership.” Ellison (Oracle), the second-richest person on earth, had backed Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), while Griffin, the 39th-wealthiest, had been a Gov. Nikki Haley (R-S.C.) supporter. A total of 81 billionaires (or more) are backing Harris. Forbes identified these 28 billionaires who donated $1 million toward groups supporting Harris through August: Michael Bloomberg, left, and Harris appear together in 2023. The following 36 billionaires made between $50,000 and $999,999 in donations to groups supporting Harris through August, according to Forbes’ analysis of FEC data: Bloomberg reported these additional four billionaires have donated to Harris’ election funds or groups supporting Harris’ election: These six billionaires signed a Sept. 6 open letter supporting Harris: UPDATE (Oct. 16): And these three billionaires donated to a Harris committee during the third quarter, according to FEC filings analyzed by The New York Times: And there's music stars Bruce Springsteen, who backed Harris Oct. 3, and Taylor Swift, who endorsed Harris Sept. 10. A total of 51 billionaires have been identified as Trump backers. Forbes identified in August these 26 billionaires who had donated at least $1 million toward Trump election efforts: Musk, right, jumps on stage as he joins Trump at a Saturday rally. Another 16 billionaires gave between $50,000 and $999,999 to groups supporting Trump through that period: UPDATE (Oct. 16): The New York Times named the following three billionaires as donating at least $100,000 to Trump groups last quarter: And of course there’s Elon Musk (Tesla and SpaceX CEO), who gave $75 million last quarter to his pro-Trump America PAC, according to filings released Tuesday. Other known Trump supporters include Jeff Hildebrand (Hilcorp), Isaac Perlmutter (Marvel Entertainment), Thomas Peterffy (Interactive Brokers) and Gary Rollins (Rollins Inc.), according to media reports and Bloomberg’s analysis of public election records last month. UPDATE (Oct. 22): This article was updated to include Dimon’s reported private backing of Harris, Gates’ reported donation to Harris and Ballmer’s comments on political spending. In addition, the New Yorker recently reported activist investor Nelson Peltz hosted a February fundraiser for Trump, where Peltz reportedly quipped Trump is “a terrible human being, but our country’s in a bad place, and we can’t afford Joe Biden.” Peltz has not made public comment since Biden ceded way to Harris, and his Trian Partners asset manager did not return a request for comment. A pair of other Wall Street billionaires have said the stock market is heavily leaning toward Trump in Daniel Loeb and Stanley Druckenmiller, though neither have publicly endorsed or made major donations toward a candidate. Fellow hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman told Fox Business he doesn’t plan to vote for either major candidate. Kyle Khan-Mullins and Leo Kalmin contributed reporting. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: vindarel: Running my 4th Common Lisp script in production© - you can do it too
URL: https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/blog/running-my-4th-lisp-script-in-production/
Time Published: 2024-10-22T17:19:26Z

📢 ⭐ NEW: 9 videos (86min) about CLOS on my Common Lisp course. Learn more and stay tuned. 🎥 I also have cool Lisp showcases on Youtube . The last ones: how to build a web app in Common Lisp, part 1 and 2. Last week I finished a new service written in Common Lisp. It now runs in production© every mornings, and it expands the set of services I offer to clients. It’s the 4th service of this kind that I developed: - they are not big - but have to be done nonetheless, and the quicker the better (they each amount to 1k to 2k lines of Lisp code), - they are not part of a super advanced domain that requires Common Lisp superpowers - I am the one who benefits from CL during development, - I could have written them in Python - and conversely nothing prevented me from writing them in Common Lisp. So here lies the goal of this post: illustrate that you don’t need to need a super difficult problem to use Common Lisp. This has been asked many times, directly to me or on social media :) At the same time, I want to encourage you to write a little something about how you use Common Lisp in the real world. Sharing creates emulation. Do it! If you don’t have a blog you can simply write in a new GitHub repository or in a Gist and come share on /r/lisp. We don’t care. Thanks <3 We’ll briefly see what my scripts do, what libraries I use, how I deploy them, what I did along the way. Needless to say that I dogfooded my CIEL (beta) meta-library and scripting tool for all those projects. Table of Contents My latest script needs to read data from a DB, format what’s necessary according to specifications, and send the result by SFTP. In this case I read a DB that I own, created by a software that I develop and host. So I could have developed this script in the software itself, right? I could have, but I would have been tied to the main project’s versioning scheme, quirks, and deployment. I rather had to write this script on the side. And since it can be done on the side, it can be done in Common Lisp. I have to extract products and their data (price, VAT…), aggregate the numbers for each day, write this to a file, according to a specification. To read the DB, I used cl-dbi. I didn’t format the SQL with SxQL this time like in my web apps (where I use the Mito light ORM), but I wrote SQL directly. I’m spoiled by the Django ORM (which has its idiosyncrasies and shortcomings), so I double checked the different kinds of JOINs and all went well. I had to group rows by some properties, so it was a great time to use serapeum:assort. I left you an example here: https://dev.to/vindarel/common-lisps-group-by-is-serapeumassort-32ma Dates have to be handled in different formats. I used local-time of course, and I still greatly appreciate its lispy formatter syntax: the 2 in (:month 2) is to ensure the month is written with 2 digits. Once the file is written, I have to send it to a SFTP server, with the client’s codes. I wrote a profile class to encapsulate the client’s data as well as some functions to read the credentials from either environment variables, the file system, or a lisp variable. I had a top-level profile object for ease of testing, but I made sure that my functions formatting or sending data required a profile parameter. Still nothing surprising, but it’s tempting to only use global parameters for a one-off script. Except the program grows and you pay the mess later. To send the result through SFTP, I had to make a choice. The SFTP command line doesn’t make it possible to give a password as argument (or via an environment variable, etc). So I use lftp (in Debian repositories) that allows to do that. In the end, we format a command like this: You can format the command string and run it with uiop:run-program: no problem, but I took the opportunity to release another utility: First, you create a profile object. This one-liner reads the credentials from a lispy file: then you define the commands you’ll want to run: and finally you call the run method on a profile and a command. Tada. Build a binary the classic way (it’s all on the Cookbook), send it to your server, run it. (during a testing phase I have deployed “as a script”, from sources, which is a bit quicker to pull changes and try again on the server) Set up a CRON job. No Python virtual env to activate in the CRON environment… Add command line arguments the easy way or with the library of your choice (I like Clingon). My script #2 at the time was similar and simpler. I extract the same products but only take their quantities, and I assemble lines like For this service, we have to send the file to a simple FTP server. We have a pure Lisp library for FTP (and not SFTP) which works very well, cl-ftp. It’s a typical example of an old library that didn’t receive any update in years and so that looks abandoned, that has seldom documentation but whose usage is easy to infer, and that does its job as requested. For example we do this to send a file: I left you notes about cl-ftp and my SFTP wrapper here: A recent web app that I’m testing with a couple clients extends an existing stock management system. This one also was done in order to avoid a Python monolith. I still needed additions in the Python main software, but this little app can be independent and grow on its own. The app maintains its state and communicates it with a REST API. It gives a web interface to their clients (so my clients’ clients, but not all of them, only the institutional) so that they can: The peculiarities of this app are that: I deploy a self-contained binary: code + html templates in the same binary (+ the implementation, the web server, the debugger…), with Systemd. I wrote more on how to ship a standalone binary with templates and static assets with Djula templates here: I can connect to the running app with a Swank server to check and set parameters, which is super helpful and harmless. It is possible to reload the whole app from within itself and I did it with no hiccups for a couple years, but it isn’t necessary the most reliable, easiest to set up and fastest method. You can do it, but nobody forces you to do this because you are running CL in production. You can use the industry’s boring and best practices too. Common Lisp doesn’t inforce a “big ball of mud” approach. Develop locally, use Git, use a CI, deploy a binary… Every thing that I learned I documented it along the way in the Cookbook ;) Another app that I’ll mention but about which I also wrote earlier is my first web app. This one is open-source. It still runs :) In this project I had my friend and colleague contribute five lines of Lisp code to add a theme switcher in the backend that would help him do the frontend. He had never written a line of Lisp before. Of course, he did so by looking at my existing code to learn the existing functions at hand, and he could do it because the project was easy to install and run. He had to annotate the if branches :] This passed the code review. The 5th script/app is already on the way, and the next ones are awaiting that I open their .docx specification files. This one was a bit harder but the Lisp side was done sucessfully with the efficient collaboration of another freelance lisper (Kevin @vinn2010 to not name him). All those tasks (read a DB, transform data…) are very mundane. They are everywhere. They don’t always need supercharged web framework or integrations. You have plenty of opportunities to make yourself a favor, and use Common Lisp in the wild. Not counting the super-advanced domains where Lisp excels at ;) I have done some preliminary Common Lisp exploration prior to this course but had a lot of questions regarding practical use and development workflows. This course was amazing for this! I learned a lot of useful techniques for actually writing the code in Emacs, as well as conversational explanations of concepts that had previously confused me in text-heavy resources. Please keep up the good work and continue with this line of topics, it is well worth the price! [Preston, October of 2024] © Lisp journey. Like the content? Want to offer a ko-fi?

Title: Huawei may have tried to skirt chip export controls, TSMC tells authorities

An advanced chip manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was reportedly found in sanctioned Chinese tech giant Huawei’s latest artificial intelligence chips. Research firm TechInsights took apart Huawei’s cutting-edge AI accelerator and found an Ascend 910B chip made by TSMC (TSM-1.46%), Reuters and Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The Canadian research firm told TSMC about its findings, prompting the Taiwanese chipmaker to inform the U.S. government about Huawei’s possible violation of U.S. export controls, Reuters reported. The Chinese tech company said it hasn’t “produced any chips via TSMC after the implementation of the amendments made by the US Department of Commerce to its FDPR that target Huawei in 2020,” in a statement shared with Bloomberg. The rule does not allow the export of any good to any country if it is manufactured with a certain percentage of U.S. intellectual property components. Huawei added that it “has never launched the 910B chip.” TSMC also informed the U.S. government about a potential attempt by Huawei to have it make AI chips for the company, the Financial Times reported. The Taiwanese chipmaker said in a statement shared with Quartz that it “proactively communicated with the U.S. commerce department regarding” a report by The Information last week that it was under investigation for making AI or smartphone chips for Huawei, which would be a violation of U.S. export controls. “We are not aware of TSMC being the subject of any investigation at this time,” TSMC said in the statement, adding that it “is a law-abiding company and we are committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.” The chipmaker said it has not supplied chips to Huawei “since mid-September 2020.” “If we have any reason to believe there are potential issues, we will take prompt action to ensure compliance, including conducting investigations and proactively communicating with relevant parties including customers and regulatory authorities,” TSMC said in the statement. Neither Huawei nor the Department of Commerce responded to a request for comment from Quartz. TSMC informed the Commerce Department about a customer placing orders for a chip resembling the Ascend 910B processor developed by Huawei, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. After seeing the order, a person close to TSMC told the Financial Times that the company also spoke to the customer related to the order, and that any investigation would be “related to” the Taiwanese chipmaker, but that it wouldn’t be the focus. The chipmaker reportedly made the precursor to Huawei’s chip before U.S. sanctions were placed on the Chinese tech company. A Commerce Department spokesperson told the Financial Times that its Bureau of Industry and Security is aware of The Information’s report, and that it “cannot comment on whether any investigation is ongoing.” Officials from the BIS met with TSMC leaders earlier this month about issues with its supply chain, Bloomberg reported, including over if third-party distributors could allow China access to restricted technology. TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares were down around 1.5% during mid-day trading on Tuesday. This story has been updated with additional information and a statement from TSMC.

Title: Why Ford Stock Is Not a Confident Pre-Earnings Pick

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. If you buy a stock before an earnings event, the risk is elevated, and you need to be confident about the company’s growth trajectory. As it turns out, Ford Motor (F) is about to report its earnings data. As a cautious investor, I am bearish on Ford stock because the company’s already-released sales data raises concerns. Ford Motor is an automotive giant that sells both conventional and electric vehicles. The company pays a decent dividend and, as we’ll discover, Ford shares appear to be bargain-priced. On the other hand, it’s not a great idea to jump on a stock just because a company has a low price-to-earnings (P/E) and offers a big dividend. It’s just as important for an automaker to demonstrate sales growth, and in that regard, Ford’s gears are stuck in reverse. You’ve heard about value traps, and maybe you’ve heard of yield traps. Could Ford fit into both of these categories? It’s entirely possible, so let’s delve into Ford’s details and see if there’s a value-and-yield trap with F stock. Ford has a non-GAAP trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 6.77x, which is certainly lower than the sector median P/E ratio of 14.98x. Furthermore, offers a forward annual dividend yield of 7.05%, which seems more favorable than the Consumer Cyclical Sector Average dividend yield of around 1%. Don’t jump to any conclusions, though. It’s possible for a company to have a very low P/E ratio and a very high dividend yield, like Ford does, if the share price drops sharply. It wasn’t too long ago when F stock plummeted from $14.50 to $11. Rapid, steep stock-price collapses can create distortions in P/E ratios and dividend yields, so don’t enter into any hasty trades with Ford stock right now. Quarterly financial reports can cause a stock to rally or tank. Nevertheless, some risk-takers will grab shares of Ford stock today, even though the company is set to disclose its third-quarter 2024 financial results on October 28, which is coming up very soon. So, there’s already reason to feel neutral about Ford stock right now. Yet, I’m actually feeling a little bit bearish about F stock before the company’s earnings event, and there’s a specific reason for this. I don’t have a crystal ball, but we all can look at Ford’s third-quarter 2024 vehicle sales numbers before the automaker’s financial results are to be released. Specifically, Ford sold 504,039 units versus 500,504 units in the year-earlier quarter, and that only represents a 0.7% year-over-year increase. In contrast, Ford demonstrated 7.7% year-on-year vehicle sales growth in the third quarter of 2023. Ford isn’t the only Detroit-based automaker showing an alarming sales trajectory, as Stellantis (STLA) recently posted a 20% decline in U.S. quarterly sales. Evidently, concerns about vehicle affordability are dragging on Detroit-based automakers’ sales growth figures. So, ask yourself: Do I really need to take any unnecessary chances on F stock today? Moreover, there’s another sign that Ford’s having trouble under the hood. Specifically, Ford just announced its plans to reduce its subscription prices for the company’s BlueCruise hands-free driving technology. BlueCruise offers autonomous (hands-free) driving features, such as lane-keep assist and adaptive cruise control. In fact, Ford expects to lower the prices for both its annual and monthly BlueCruise subscriptions. These will be steep price cuts, from $75 to $50 for the monthly subscription plan and from $800 to $495 for the annual plan. This surely isn’t a positive sign for Ford. Self-driving features are supposed to be front-page news nowadays, but Ford’s steep subscription price cuts indicate that BlueCruise isn’t a highly in-demand service. This adds to my bearish argument and causes me to wonder whether competitors like Tesla (TSLA) will command a strong lead over Ford in the market for self-driving technology services. On TipRanks, F stock comes in as a Moderate Buy based on five Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell rating assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Ford Motor stock price target is $12.68, implying 15.64% upside potential. If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell Ford stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Michael Ward of Benchmark Co., with an average return of 11.88% per rating and a 50% success rate. See more F analyst ratings As you can see, analysts are only lukewarm about Ford Motor stock. Also, it’s apparent that Ford’s BlueCruise subscriptions aren’t selling like hotcakes. Additionally, with an earnings event coming up soon, Ford could disappoint investors as the automaker’s quarterly vehicle sales growth is slowing. In other words, Ford has issues to address, and investors don’t need to jump into what might be a value-and-yield trap. Instead, you can choose to wait until Ford’s third-quarter 2024 financial results to see if there are any major positive surprises. I’m not super-confident that this will happen, so as a cautious investor, I’m leaning slightly bearish on F stock and staying on the sidelines. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

Americans are cutting down holiday spending, as more professionals feel the crunch of rising home ... [+] costs With the festive season just around the corner, many Americans are cutting down on spending for Christmas gifts. "U.S. shoppers say they're going to spend less on holiday gifts this year, which would deliver another blow to retailers that have struggled with waning demand," Bloomberg reported recently. "Spending intentions for gifts declined 3% from a year ago, according to a survey of more than 4,000 respondents by Deloitte." This is no doubt due to increased costs, especially those arising from housing and soaring interest rates. In addition, U.S. professionals have little job and career stability and are under the threat of job loss due to layoffs and budget cuts. They are also forced to look elsewhere for work due to RTO mandates, and this combination of factors places restrictions on how American professionals are spending (or saving) their hard-earned salary. When your income flow is tight, it certainly helps to have something extra on the side so you can quickly bolster your salary, purchase thoughtful gifts for your loved ones, and enjoy the holidays relatively stress-free while giving yourself a healthy financial kickstart to the new year. These quick-start part-time remote job ideas should inspire you: If you have copywriting, SEO, marketing, design, or blogging experience, you can easily sign up and create a freelancer profile on Freelancer, Upwork, and Fiverr platforms. The process can usually be completed in a matter of hours, although in some instances, approval of your profile may take a little longer (up to a few days). There are hundreds of specialized services that you can provide on these platforms, and you can start bidding for projects immediately. If you have an eye for detail and a passion for grammar and language, why not make money from proofreading? You can hunt around and discover jobs at publishing companies, sites such as PaperTrue (not currently hiring, but keep an eye out), Scribbr, Scribendi, and, of course, freelance platforms and job boards such as Indeed. Cactus Communications, also known as Cactus Global, is hiring for remote freelance translator roles in multiple countries, covering languages including Japanese, Russian, Korean, Turkish, and Chinese. The company also has job listings for a freelance voice-over artist and a peer reviewer, which are included as part-time remote jobs, which you will need to apply for. Although it is unclear how long the process takes to start, this is just one example of many, of where you can utilize your bilingual skills to bring in extra cash. You can bid for translator work on the freelance platforms listed above as well. Affiliate marketing is when you have a URL to a company's product or service, and whenever someone clicks on your link and purchases, you receive a commission. With Amazon's Affiliate program, registering is pretty easy, and you can be up and running in no time. If you already have a blog or are very active on social media and generate a large following and engagement, this is the perfect way to continue talking about what you love, or even discussing your industry and business, while making money from mentions of any products. Gigs on freelance marketplaces are easy to apply for and you can even get hired the same day Each of these part-time remote job opportunities requires minimal set-up, and with a strategic marketing approach, you can maximize your enjoyment of the holiday season with friends and family.

Title: Walmart adds pharmacy to same-day delivery

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The retail giant said it’s responding to a top request from its customers. The option is now available in six states and will expand nationally. Meeting a top demand voiced by its customers, Walmart on Tuesday said it is expanding same-day delivery to include prescription medications. Eventually customers will be able to get prescriptions delivered within hours or as soon as 30 minutes. The option is now available in six states — Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin — with plans to expand to 49 by the end of January. Under this program, customers can include prescriptions, grocery items or both for delivery. Walmart+ members, who pay a $98 annual fee for a variety of benefits, will receive free pharmacy delivery, while non-Walmart+ members pay $9.95. With the two major drugstore retailers in the U.S. in turmoil, Walmart is expanding convenience for its pharmacy customers, augmenting delivery services that the retail giant says reach 86% of households in the country. “Our extensive footprint across the nation combined with our deep expertise in pharmacy uniquely positions us to make a profound impact in the communities we serve," Kevin Host, senior vice president of pharmacy at Walmart U.S., said in a statement. “We understand that health care is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It’s hyper-local. Each community has unique needs. This new offering allows us to continue serving customers while also giving more time back to our pharmacies for high-touch health services.” The move is a response to a survey of customers Walmart conducted a couple of years ago, which found that 55% would like prescriptions included in their grocery deliveries and other online orders; this was the top request of “Walmart customers who self-identified as time-sensitive, busy families,” the company said in a blog post. Meanwhile, both Walgreens and CVS Health are downsizing. In a move to tighten its grip on expenses further, Walgreens last week said it will close 1,200 stores in the next three years. The company said its retail operations were a drag on its Q4 and full year results. In recent weeks CVS, also in the throes of cost-cutting, confirmed plans to lay off 2,900 employees. Both Walgreens and CVS have also shaken up their leadership over the last several months, with the latter replacing its CEO just last week. Walmart is also scaling back some health care options, however, saying earlier this year that, due to high operational costs, it will end its telehealth services and shutter all 51 health centers. Even Amazon, which has entered the pharmacy and health care business in part through acquisitions, recently confirmed hundreds of layoffs in those areas.

Title: How To Prevent A Mass Exodus During Return To Office
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/karadennison/2024/10/22/how-to-prevent-a-mass-exodus-during-return-to-office/
Time Published: 2024-10-22T15:36:20Z

How to Prevent a Mass Exodus During RTO Amazon's recent five-day return-to-office (RTO) mandate has sparked significant employee discontent. This mandate shows the tension between companies and employees at the moment. The situation at Amazon reflects a trend across corporate America, a situation that must be addressed if business leaders want to retain top talent in today's market. Back in 2023, Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy announced that his workers should return to the office for at least three days a week. Employees strongly resisted this at the time. Before workers had fully adjusted to the three-day mandate, Amazon tightened its RTO policy to five days a week. This has led to intense employee backlash and the potential for a massive exodus of talent. A memo from September 16 says Amazon will cut management layers and require employees to return to the office full-time. A recent survey done by Blind of 2,585 Amazon employees found that 73% of Amazon professionals are rethinking their jobs since the news broke. The survey goes on to note that 80% of employees knew a colleague considering leaving. The reason for considering a new role outside of Amazon is not far-fetched. The new RTO policy is less flexible, especially for parents and long-distance commuters. Amazon employees hope leaders will reconsider a policy effective in 2025, or they will quit. In December 2023, many Amazon Web Services workers resigned when the three-day RTO policy launched. With the updated five-day policy, we might see a spike in those numbers. Amazon's new policy shows the ongoing tension between leaders and employees today. Many organizations are still pushing for rigid RTO policies despite the discontent among the workforce. In fact, according to a survey done by Resume Builder in August, 87% of companies will have returned to office by 2025, with big companies like UPS, Boeing, and JPMorgan Chase leading the line. These larger organizations cite improved productivity, higher revenue, and a strong culture as drivers for RTO. But there's no clear data to track the effectiveness of these RTO policies. The new Amazon RTO policy has drawn criticism from employees. Some say the mandate was not done kindly or transparently. Some employees state they learned this new policy from a news article. When these things happen, workers lose trust in their leadership, and understandably so. The truth is Amazon’s in-office model has been in flux post-COVID. In fact, there have been cases of employees who were hired remotely in 2023 and are now being instructed to return to the office immediately. Fortune reports that most were promised work from home when they were hired, but now, they're forced to change their work-life balance to fit in or keep their jobs. On the other hand, it’s been reported that the RTO mandate has not been applied across all of Amazon’s subsidiaries. For example, Amazon's One Medical subsidiary will let employees work 3 days a week starting in October. This has caused more company-wide disputes. This new policy is creating friction not just with workers but also with global mandates, especially with the UK government's push for flexible working rights ahead of the holiday season. The UK government has actively promoted flexible work and argues remote work boosts performance and loyalty. In contrast, Amazon maintains that in-office work fosters better collaboration and innovation. For many employees, the return-to-office policies represent a substantial financial strain. A 2023 Owl Labs report found that full-time office workers now spend an average of $51 daily and $1,020 monthly to work full-time in the office, compared to $408 per month for hybrid workers. It's now more expensive to work from the office than in 2019. This does not include the time spent commuting to and from the office. Workers are skeptical of the motives behind RTO policies beyond the additional monetary cost. A MyPerfectResume study found that 77% of workers believe RTO policies give employers more control. 64% think their employers don't trust them to work from home. However, the real reasons may be more sinister. An emerging report says a quarter of VP and C-suite executives plan to use RTO mandates as a smokescreen to cut jobs and boost margins. Some industry observers have dubbed this strategy "back-channel layoffs." Additionally, corporate messaging says that RTO policies aim to boost collaboration and innovation. Yet, 22% of HR pros admit their firms lack the data to measure this. Without tracking, transparency, and KPIs, the consequences can be severe and directly impact a company's bottom line. For instance, 8 in 10 employers lost talent to return-to-office mandates, and the cost of replacing them is substantial. To avoid a mass exodus of employees like at Amazon, consider these strategies for a successful hybrid or flexible Return to Office (RTO) policy: Instead of implementing blanket mandates, engage your team in the decision-making process. This inclusive approach provides valuable insights. It also fosters a sense of ownership among employees. This increases their buy-in for the final policy. Conduct anonymous surveys or focus groups to understand individual circumstances and concerns. The pandemic has shifted employee priorities. Ford's global study found that 77% of employed individuals now value a balanced personal life over career advancement. Create flexible work options, like hybrid models or flexible hours. Balancing business needs with employee needs is a way to ensure both get met. As a leader, set clear benchmarks. Use tools to track productivity, collaboration, and employee satisfaction across work models. Consider metrics such as employee performance level, engagement scores, and retention rates, and use this data to refine your policies over time. With RTO costs rising, it's crucial to consider the financial impact on your team. Evaluate your compensation and benefits package holistically. Consider offering perks like commuter benefits, meal allowances, cost-of-living adjustments, and childcare or eldercare subsidies. Your leadership team's actions will set the tone for the entire organization. Ensure that company leaders adhere to the same RTO policies as other employees. Be visible and accessible in the office when you expect your team to be there. Publicly recognize teams and individuals who embody the company's new work culture. A survey of over 5,000 workers found that 95% say their emotional well-being impacts their productivity. Consider on-site counseling, local mental health provider partnerships, and mental health app subscriptions. Also, regular workshops on stress management, work-life balance, employee wellness, and self-leadership should be held. Train managers to recognize and support employees' mental health needs. Clear, consistent communication is key to successful policy implementation. Create a full communication plan for your RTO strategy. It should include: Q&A sessions to address concerns, anonymous feedback channels for input, and clear decision-making guidelines. Overwhelmingly, employees are experiencing distrust when it comes to the organizations they work for. Organizations are not handling their RTO policies in ways that keep in mind the fact that their employees are humans with other priorities and needs outside of the office. When delivering life-altering news to employees, it’s important to be transparent and holistic when considering how your organization treats its most vital resource: its people. One Community.

ERIC KIM Over the past four years, MicroStrategy (MSTR) has outperformed both Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) in terms of stock growth, largely due to its significant exposure to Bitcoin. Here’s a breakdown of their performance: • MicroStrategy (MSTR): The stock surged 1,067% between 2020 and 2024, driven by its aggressive Bitcoin holdings strategy, which has been the primary factor behind its explosive growth. • Nvidia (NVDA): Over the same period, Nvidia saw a remarkable 1,008% increase, bolstered by its leadership in AI and semiconductor technologies. • Apple (AAPL): Apple, while experiencing steady growth, has seen a much lower percentage increase compared to the others, around 322%, reflecting its more stable, less speculative growth trajectory. MSTR’s growth is more volatile and heavily tied to the cryptocurrency market, while Nvidia’s gains are due to technological advancements in AI, and Apple’s rise is grounded in its dominant position in consumer electronics and services.

Title: The U.S. will keep pressuring allies to restrict chip sales to China, ASML chief says

With U.S. restrictions on investing in artificial intelligence in China expected imminently, the head of a major Dutch chipmaking equipment company said he expects more pressure on U.S. allies to curb chip sales to China. Christophe Fouquet, chief executive of ASML (ASML+0.26%), said most of its business in China is focused “on mainstream semiconductors,” which “is very different from AI,” during the Bloomberg Tech Summit on Tuesday. China has been ASML’s largest market for the last five quarters, with nearly half of the Dutch company’s revenue for the second-quarter coming from sales to the country, Bloomberg reported. “If you look at the geopolitical landscape, I think it’s clear that the U.S. will continue to apply pressure on their allies for more restrictions,” Fouquet said. “The question is, what is right for the Netherlands? What is right for Europe?” China-based Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) depend on ASML’s DUV lithography machines to make advanced chips. The country has been unable to build a similar version of ASML’s equipment, and China cannot buy ASML’s extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, machines, which are used to make the world’s most advanced chips used by companies such as Nvidia (NVDA+0.52%) and Apple (AAPL-0.10%). Existing U.S. restrictions on China are holding it “10 to 15 years behind when it comes to advanced technology,” Fouquet said. In September, the Netherlands announced new export control rules requiring ASML to apply for export licenses with the Hague instead of with the U.S. to sell some of its equipment to China. Shares of ASML fell 16% last week after it published financial results early that showed a downward revision of guidance for 2025. “While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover,” Fouquet said in the company’s earnings report. “It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.” However, Fouquet told Bloomberg he expects both the chip industry and ASML to continue growing next year. “We also expect 2026 to be a growth year,” he said, “but it’s too early to quantify that.” Meanwhile, the U.S. government is in the final review stage for restrictions on outbound U.S. investments in sensitive technologies such as AI, semiconductors, and quantum computing to China, according to a government update. The final rules are expected to be released in the next week or weeks, Reuters reported. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

No financial details were disclosed but Lumen, already riding on the wave of AI-fuelled demand for extra network capacity, says it’s going to provide “dedicated interconnection” – using its fibre-based ‘private connectivity fabric’ – for Meta’s infrastructure. “We’ve transformed our company to meet this demand,” enthused Haynes-Gaspar. “As Meta’s customers use more AI services across its platforms, we’re helping provide Meta with a seamless, effortless, and flexible network that will meet its growing needs.” Alex-Handrah Aimé, director of Meta’s network investments, seemed equally ebullient about the Lumen hook-up. “Our AI tools are performing increasingly more complex tasks, including enabling conversations in a variety of languages and translating text to images in real time, while helping people interact with the world around them in new, immersive ways,” she said. The Meta deal follows on from Lumen’s recent announcement that it had secured $5bn in new business deals to help it address the major demand for connectivity fuelled by AI. The company explained that large companies are looking to expand their fibre capacity as it becomes “increasingly valuable and potentially limited” due to “booming AI needs”. One of these deals includes a recent collaboration with Microsoft that will see Lumen act as a “strategic supplier” for the tech giant’s network infrastructure needs driven by AI developments. International network operator Veon has swiftly responded to the letter sent to its board by activist investor Shah Capital (holding a 7% stake), which called for multiple courses of action to improve the operator’s valuation and shareholder returns (see Monday’s news roundup for Shah Capital’s shopping list of demands). Veon’s management conceded in this published response that its disgruntled shareholder might have a point: “While Veon’s share value has more than doubled over the past two years, the company also shares Shah Capital’s assessment that its current share price indicates a potential for further improvement, as Veon positions itself as a leading opportunity for investors seeking growth in frontier markets.” At the same time, though, it says it is already doing much of what Shah Capital is demanding, such as considering local or regional initial public offerings (IPOs) for some units and engaging more forcefully with investors and financial analysts (albeit without much in the way of concrete results as yet…). Veon noted that it continues to “execute its strategic initiatives, including advancing its strong operating outlook, optimising its capital structure, and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation.” That’s not going to cut it for the Shah Capital team, though, which is also demanding share buybacks and dividends to help boost Veon’s valuation and make it a more attractive investment. “We are carefully considering the recommendations in the Shah Letter, which include suggestions on capital returns, improving market valuation, leveraging Veon’s strengths in emerging markets and further enhancing communication with the investment community,” noted Veon – so certainly no hint of any immediate share buyback plans. Veon’s third-quarter results are due to be published and discussed on 13 November – that could make for an interesting investor call. Veon’s share price dipped by almost 1.7% to $30.38 on the Nasdaq exchange in early trading on Tuesday and that certainly won’t appease any of Veon’s shareholders. DigitalBridge has successfully acquired a majority stake in Japanese towers firm JTower and will now move to take the company private. DigitalBridge announced its intention to acquire JTower in August after several large shareholders agreed to sell their stakes once it became clear that it was proving hard to raise additional external investment because of the long return on investment cycle in the business. DigitalBridge has managed to acquire a 75.62% controlling interest in JTower for 70.1bn yen ($465m): It now plans to delist JTower from the Tokyo stock exchange and take it private, with DigitalBridge and Cultive, an asset management company of JTower’s representative director Atsushi Tanaka, the only shareholders. JTower, which counts all of Japan’s main mobile operators as users of its shared infrastructure, operates 589 shared in-building systems (IBSs) in Japan, as well as 243 in other countries, and more than 6,700 outdoor towers in Japan. Justin Chang, senior managing director and head of Asia at DigitalBridge, stated: “We are excited to solidify our investment in JTower, a leading player in Japan’s digital infrastructure sector. This strategic investment underscores our confidence in JTower’s long-term potential and its critical role in advancing next-generation digital networks. We look forward to collaborating with the JTower team to accelerate their growth, expand their presence, and drive enhanced connectivity throughout Japan, while continuing to serve the strategic and operational needs of customers.” ZTE has posted a subdued set of Q3 2024 financials. Operating revenue, at 27.6bn yuan (CNY) ($3.9bn), fell by nearly 4% compared with the same period last year. Net cash flow plummeted by an alarming 63% over the same period, to a shade over CNY 1bn ($140m). This vitally important financial metric looks a bit more stable, however, when viewed from the longer timeframe of the first nine months of 2024 (falling 10.1% year-on-year to CNY 8.05bn). Detailed commentary on the vendor’s performance during the quarter proved elusive, although a brief press release covering the first nine months cited progress in its international markets, where the Chinese vendor “continued to make breakthroughs with major countries and key operators, maintaining double-digit growth”. It also referred, without a breakdown of figures, to “rapid growth” in the company’s consumer and government-enterprise businesses. What is clear is that ZTE continues to plough significant sums into R&D – CNY18.6bn ($2.6bn) during the first nine months of this year, which represents more than a fifth of revenue generated during that time. ZTE flagged 5G advanced, ‘full-stack intelligent computing’ and all-optical networks as key areas of innovation. What is also pretty clear is that ZTE is not doing nearly as well as high-flying rival Huawei, which racked up CNY 417.5bn ($58.6bn) in revenues during the first half of 2024 and a whopping year-on-year increase of 34.3%. Consolidation in the cybersecurity sector… Oxford, UK-based Sophos, which is backed by private equity giant Thoma Bravo, is acquiring Secureworks for $859m. “Sophos’ experience and reputation as a leading provider of managed security services and end-to-end security products, combined with Secureworks’ security operations expertise… is expected to further deliver complementary advanced MDR [managed detection and response] and XDR [extended detection and response] solutions for the benefit of their global customer bases. Together, they will help strengthen the resilience and security posture of global organisations of any size with a combination of security controls, AI, world-class threat intelligence, and two teams with decades of cybersecurity expertise,” noted Sophos in this announcement. Joe Levy, CEO of Sophos, said: “Secureworks offers an innovative, market-leading solution with their Taegis XDR platform. Combined with our security solutions and industry leadership in MDR, we will strengthen our collective position in the market and provide better outcomes for organisations of all sizes globally. Secureworks’ renowned expertise in cybersecurity perfectly aligns with our mission to protect businesses from cybercrime by delivering powerful and intuitive products and services.” Ericsson has struck 50 deals for its 5G charging system, of which 20 are using the system in their commercial day-to-day operations “to monetise 5G at scale”. In marking its customer milestone, Ericsson makes a key point about the importance of such systems, which are key to telco business processes. “While the charging functionality is a vital and important part of a CSP’s monetisation model, it is still part of a wider set of capabilities that work in concert to deliver revenue, manage costs and complexity and flex to adapt rapidly to changing demands and service creation needs. An adaptable 5G-ready charging system needs to support new charging trigger points as services and use cases evolve (including for internet of things [IoT]), manage lifecycles for mass IoT devices and huge numbers of individual subscriptions, manage multiparty charging involving hierarchies and charging ‘on behalf of’ arrangements as well as non-telco service charging, such as API monetisation use cases,” noted the vendor.

Title: The Dow drops 150 points as gold hits a record, and Treasury yields rise

Time Published: 2024-10-22T14:25:00Z

The Dow fell by 165 points on Tuesday morning as gold prices surged to another record high and interest rates continued to climb. Federal Reserve policymakers are considering a more moderate approach to future interest rate cuts, a shift that has dampened investor sentiment. The prospect of slower rate reductions suggests that the Fed remains cautious about balancing inflation control with economic growth, contributing to the broader market’s unease. Shortly after the market opened Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 165 points, or 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 shed 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. Spot gold prices have surged past $2,700 an ounce, reaching a new record high of $2,733. This marks a significant milestone for the precious metal, which has gained more than 30% year-to-date, driven by heightened investor demand for safe-haven assets amid ongoing economic uncertainties and tension in the Middle East. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury briefly climbed above 4.2%—its highest level since July—before pulling back slightly. The rise in bond yields reflects concerns over persistent inflation and the potential for further tightening by the Federal Reserve, which has kept pressure on equity markets. Several major companies are reporting earnings on Tuesday, including 3M (MMM-1.13%), General Motors (GM-0.41%), GE Aerospace (GE-1.07%), and Verizon Communications (VZ-2.33%), all of which drew significant attention from investors. Nvidia (NVDA+0.52%), which hit another high on Monday, was down 0.6% Tuesday morning, while Tesla (TSLA+21.88%), which reports earnings on Wednesday, was down 0.8%.

Title: The future of the S&P 500 has everyone divided
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/goldman-sachs-stock-returns-prediction-different-projections-inflation-bullish-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-22T13:22:40Z
Full Content:
Good morning! A Sam's Club with robots making pizza and no cash registers could be the new norm for the warehouse club. CEO Chris Nicholas spoke to BI about what he wants shopping "in the future" to feel like. In today's big story, Goldman Sachs thinks the past decade of big returns from the S&P 500 is coming to a close. What's on deck: But first, is this the end? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Forget the economy; Goldman Sachs is projecting a hard landing for future stock returns. The bank's portfolio strategy research team forecasts the S&P 500 will see annualized returns of 3% over the next decade, writes BI's Filip De Mott. That'd be a sharp comedown for stock investors, who have enjoyed 13% in annualized returns for the major index over the past 10 years. Setting aside the market's recent strength, Goldman's forecast still isn't great. Annualized returns of 3% would put it in the 7th percentile of performance since 1930. Goldman's rationale for the pessimistic take includes two things even a rookie investor can appreciate: The market is overvalued AND too concentrated. Currently, the S&P 500 cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio is 38, well above the index's average of 22. And the usual suspects — tech giants like Nvidia and Meta — have done much of the heavy lifting in helping the S&P 500 to record highs. Not everyone agrees with Goldman's forecast. This very newsletter recently included commentary from experts who said the two-year-old bull market still had plenty of gas left in the tank. It seems the only industry consensus we have about stocks' future is there is no consensus. Case in point: Goldman is bullish on a short-term perspective, recently raising its year-end S&P 500 price target. BI's Matthew Fox has a rundown on predictions from the bulls, the bears, and those somewhere in the middle. UBS, for example, sees another big gain for the S&P 500 next year, writes BI's Jennifer Sor. The bank said a "no landing" for the US economy means the S&P 500 could rise roughly 13% from its current levels. Inflation would remain somewhat elevated in the scenario, but the bank still sees room for the Fed to cut rates, which is bullish for stocks. On the other side of the spectrum are JPMorgan, which has maintained its bearish outlook this year in the face of a surging market, and Stifel, which has predicted a massive market downturn in 2025. At the center of the debate sits artificial intelligence. Bears point to the tech as overinflating valuations with little to no evidence of it meaningfully driving revenue. Bulls say the hype is warranted, as the impact of AI is inevitable, like the rise of the internet. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

U.S. stock futures are lower as indexes step back from record highs and Treasury yields move higher; General Motors (GM) and GE Aerospace (GE) beat third-quarter earnings estimates; Nvidia (NVDA) is close to eclipsing Apple's (AAPL) market capitalization; and Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) shares are rising on a report an activist investor is urging the restaurant chain to break up. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are lower Tuesday, a day after major indexes closed mixed. Coming off a six-week winning streak and record closing highs on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 moved lower on Monday, while the Nasdaq gained ground. Meanwhile, Treasury yields have hit their highest levels since July as investors factor in slower expectations of interest-rate cuts. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.19% on Monday, an increase of 11 basis points, to deliver the biggest intraday rise since Oct. 4. Automaker General Motors (GM) beat analysts' expectations with its third-quarter earnings report Tuesday morning. The Cadillac and Chevrolet maker reported revenue of $48.76 billion, better than the consensus estimate of $45.02 billion from analysts polled by Visible Alpha, while its profit of $3.06 billion topped projections of $2.59 billion. GM also raised the lower end of its full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) guidance to $10.00 to $10.50, up from the prior guidance of $9.50 to $10.50. Shares of GM are about 1% lower in premarket trading. GE Aerospace (GE) delivered third-quarter earnings that were better than analysts' expectations as the company reported strong demand for its airplane engines and parts. The company's revenue of $9.84 billion was above the projection of $9.55 billion from analysts polled by Visible Alpha, while its net income of $1.89 billion, or $1.56 per share, topped the projected $1.28 billion and $1.19. The aerospace manufacturer also also lifted its profit projections for full-year 2024, guiding adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to a range of $4.20 to $4.35, up from $3.95 to $4.20 previously. Still, shares are declining more than 5% in premarket trading as commercial engines revenue came in a bit short of expectations. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are inching higher in premarket trading after the chipmaker hit another all-time high on Monday of $143.71 as analysts continued to project upward momentum for the company's artificial intelligence (AI) products. Bank of America named Nvidia a "top AI pick" and moved the company's price target to $190 from $165. The rise puts Nvidia's market capitalization around $3.5 trillion as it gains on Apple (AAPL) to become the world's largest corporation. Apple's market capitalization is near $3.6 trillion and its shares are lower by 0.7% in premarket trading. Activist investor JCP Investment Management has taken a position in The Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) and is urging the company to break up, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The Houston-based hedge fund took a 2% stake in Cheesecake Factory, the report said, and is urging executives at the company to spin off restaurant chains North Italia, Flower Child, and Culinary Dropout. Shares of Cheesecake Factory are rising nearly 4% in premarket trading.

James L. McQuivey, PhD, VP, Research Director As 2025 approaches, businesses stand at a critical crossroads: Will they soar to new heights by embracing the future of work or stall in the face of emerging challenges? The last few years have been a roller-coaster ride, with a turbulent ascent into a seemingly bright future of work only to take a deep dive into the icy waters of layoffs, burnout, and disillusionment. And just when many thought the bottom had dropped out, we’re seeing faint signs of recovery — a bounce that will either propel companies forward or drag them further down. The fate of your organization depends on how you handle the critical choices coming your way. Among our future of work predictions for 2025, we predict big risks and opportunities such as the following: Whether our predictions for 2025 come true for you is up to you. As we saw in 2024, even as the EX winter got colder, companies that zigged while the rest zagged emerged far ahead of their counterparts. We know one financial services company that has the highest employee satisfaction scores it has ever seen, despite the general chilly work climate, because it invested in employees and addressed organizational concerns. Conversely, we’re working with many firms — in media, consumer products, and more — who are dealing with stagnant work cultures, general distrust in executives, and lower confidence in organizational strategy due to letting EX slide for the past year. That’s why we say that the future of work doesn’t have to be your future of work. Whether you stall or soar is up to you. Read our full Predictions 2025: The Future Of Work report to get more detail about each of these predictions and read additional predictions. Set up a Forrester guidance session to discuss these predictions or plan out your 2025 future of work strategy.

Title: Nvidia Price Levels to Watch as Stock Hits Record High on AI Optimism

Shares of AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA) are likely remain to remain the spotlight Tuesday after jumping to a new record high yesterday. The stock has nearly tripled since the start of the year, and most analysts believe there's further upside based on the company’s dominance of the AI chip market and insatiable demand for its next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture. Analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha have a consensus price target on the shares of $154.19, up from $152.41 a week ago and representing 7% upside from Monday's closing price of $143.71. Below, we break down the technicals on Nvidia’s weekly chart and identify important price levels that other investors will likely be watching. After reaching a prior peak in mid-June, Nvidia shares traded within a symmetrical triangle before staging a decisive breakout above the pattern earlier this month. It’s also worth pointing out, that although trading volume remains below longer-term averages, the stock logged its highest share turnover last week since late September. From a momentum standpoint, the relative strength index (RSI) indicates bullish price action and gives a reading below overbought levels, suggesting the stock has ample room to move higher. Looking ahead, let’s forecast a price target for the stock’s current uptrend and also locate several important levels on Nvidia’s chart that could attract buying interest during retracements. To speculate where the stock’s current trend higher may be headed, we can use a bars pattern, a technique that studies earlier trends to forecast future directional moves. When applying the analysis to Nvidia’s chart, we’ll extract the trend higher from April to June and reposition it from the start of the stock’s current move higher in early September. Such a technique indicates a potential upside target of around $180, about 25% above Monday’s closing price. We selected this prior trend as it commenced with a gain of around 15% on the weekly chart, similar to how the stock’s current move higher started. During periods of weakness, investors should initially keep their eyes peeled on the $125 level, a location on the chart where the shares may encounter support near the symmetrical triangle pattern’s breakout area. A breakdown below this level could see the shares decline to around $97. Investors may view this region as a buying opportunity, given its proximity to the March peak and 50-week moving average. Finally, a bearish reversal in the stock may trigger a move down to the $76 level, where bargain hunters would likely look for entry points around the mid-April pullback low.

U.S. rules that will limit some American investing into sensitive technologies including artificial intelligence (AI) in China are imminent, with a U.S. government update in the last review stage. The final rules will be released in the "next week or so" following an Office of Management and Budget review, Reuters said. The rules follow an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023 limiting U.S. investing in China that could strengthen the Asian nation's military while weakening American national security. According to that order, the U.S. Department of the Treasury was considering barring investing into China's quantum information technologies and some advanced technologies like "semiconductors and microelectronics," and requiring notification for investment into AI. The proposals were put forward for public feedback last year. The U.S. imposed export controls on advanced semiconductor chips aimed at curbing China's access last year. Such curbs have already made it harder for American firms like Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC) to sell AI chips to China.

Title: GE Aerospace Tops Q3 Estimates, Raises Profit Outlook

GE Aerospace (GE) fell 7% Tuesday morning as revenue in its commercial engines and services division fell short of analysts' expectations, even though its overall revenue and profit beat estimates. The engine and aerospace parts manufacturer posted $9.84 billion in total revenue, while analysts polled by Visible Alpha had a consensus estimate of $9.55 billion. Net income was $1.89 billion, or $1.56 per share, compared with the projected $1.28 billion and $1.19. However, GE Aerospace’s commercial engines and services revenue came in at $7.00 billion, below the $7.13 billion expectation. Revenue in the smaller defense and propulsion segment of $2.24 billion also missed estimates of $2.34 billion. The company lifted its profit projections for full-year 2024, guiding adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to a range of $4.20 to $4.35, up from $3.95 to $4.20 previously. "The GE Aerospace team delivered strong results, with demand driving orders up 28%," Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Larry Culp said. "We grew earnings 25% and produced substantial free cash flow, both largely driven by services. Given the strength of our results and 4Q expectations, we're raising our earnings and cash guidance for the year." In the weeks leading up to GE Aerospace's report, Bernstein analysts said the company faced a "key question"—the impact the Boeing (BA) machinists union strike would have on its operations. Slower production of Boeing planes would mean poorer engine sales, but would also improve the maintenance aftermarket for its existing engines. GE Aerospace didn't mention any impacts of the five-week Boeing strike in its earnings release, which could end soon after the sides came to a tentative agreement over the weekend that the union's members are set to vote on Wednesday. Analysts are the most bullish on GE Aerospace stock of the former General Electric segments, with all eight of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha maintaining a "buy" rating, compared to 11 of 13 for GE Vernova and six of 11 for GE HealthCare (GEHC). GE Aerospace also has a larger projected gain, with its average target price about 9% above its current levels, compared to just over 3% for GE Vernova and GE HealthCare. Despite today's decline, GE Aerospace shares still are up about 30% since the early April split from GE Vernova (GEV). UPDATE—This story has been updated with the latest share price and information about segment revenue.

Title: The case for a 'Magnificent 7' resurgence: Morning Brief

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The broadening of the stock market rally has become a crucial theme during the second half of 2024. Amid the start of rate cuts — and economic data that's showed the US economy remains in better shape than initially feared — the recent push to new record highs has largely been about companies not named Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), or Nvidia (NVDA). But the debate over whether the market's next leg higher will be led by just a few large tech companies — as was the case in 2023 and the early part of 2024 — continues to roll on among investors. In a note on Friday, data from FactSet showed that earnings for the 493 companies in the S&P 500 outside the "Magnificent Seven" are expected to grow by an average of more than 13% over the next five quarters. Conversely, the Magnificent Seven are expected to see earnings grow by an average of nearly 19% over the same time period. Notably, this represents a pickup in growth for the 493 from 2024 and a notch lower for the Magnificent Seven. This more positive trend in the 493 is one of the reasons strategists have called for a continued broadening out of the rally. But as our chart below shows, the difference in trend growth is a narrowing race. And some believe Big Tech could still be the winner. "The Mag 7 are still expected to post superior (and presumably more reliable) earnings growth than the rest of the index," DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas said. Colas noted that this data suggests tech "should begin to play catchup into the end of the year," as the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month and throughout 2024. "Going forward, the path to outperformance will be assessing whether Big Tech or the rest of the S&P 500 will exhibit better earnings momentum," Colas wrote. "If one believes that US GDP growth can be +3% in 2025, then the S&P 493 is likely the better bet. Our own view is that growth will be more modest, giving the edge to Big Tech." Part of the tech revival may already be playing out. Nvidia has soared to a fresh record high over the past month, its first since June. Apple stock closed at a record high of $235 per share on Friday and added to those gains on Monday. Netflix (NFLX), the first of the large tech giants to report earnings, saw a massive rally in its stock to a fresh record high after another impressive round of earnings. That move in the streaming giant is perhaps the most illuminating when considering the case for Big Tech to lead the market. Even Netflix, which had already seen its stock rise more than 50% on the year before earnings, managed to surprise Wall Street to the upside. Perhaps this serves as an early reminder that while growth in tech is "expected" to slow from its rapid pace over the past year, that doesn't mean there can't be upside surprises — or that it still can't outperform. You don't need to look beyond the past 18 months of many tech earnings reports coming in better than expected for the empirical evidence. Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Gold's Recent Record Run May Be Tempting—What to Know Before Investing

Gold prices have been climbing steadily, reaching a series of record highs as investors have piled in amid uncertainties that could affect other markets. While gold could add shine to your portfolio, advisors caution against going all in. In September, U.S. investors poured a net $1.91 billion into gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to CFRA data. “It is important to note that while both gold commodity and equity ETFs flows have been negative overall in 2024, we have seen a turn in flows recently,” CFRA said in a recent research report. Meanwhile, gold bars have been flying off the virtual shelves at Costco Wholesale (COST) since last year. The company said gold and silver bullion was one of its top digital sales categories for the quarter that ended on Sept. 1. Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge or a safe haven asset when investors worry about stocks. And this year, so far, has offered a number of reasons for investors to be concerned—uncertainty around a U.S. recession, when the Federal Reserve would begin cutting rates, the presidential election and geopolitical risks. Through the close of trading Monday, gold prices are up 32% since the start of the year, trading at around $2,700 an ounce, whereas the S&P 500—a broad barometer of U.S. stock markets—has returned 23%. Anytime an asset sees that kind of growth, investor interest surges, said Brandon Angotti, VP, Financial Planning & Trust Officer at the Wealth Group Union Savings Bank. "You just want to make sure you're very careful, so that you're not buying at the peak when everyone else is sort of chasing [it]," he said. Financial advisors recommend some amount of gold in your portfolio for the sake of diversification, but there are some factors you should keep in mind before investing. Clients should hold no more than 5% to 10% of their portfolios in an alternative investment like gold for diversification, according to Angotti. He also urges investors to read the fine print on tax rates. Gold ETFs, for example, can be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate of up to 28% as opposed to a maximum of 20% tax for equity ETFs. On top of that, said MaryAnne Gucciardi, a certified financial planner (CFP) at Wealthmind Financial Planning, if you own physical gold in the form of bars or jewelry, there is a cost of holding it safely. That could mean additional insurance costs, as well as dealer premiums you have to pay when purchasing or selling gold, Scott Van Den Berg, President of Century Management, recommends his clients have gold exposure of 6%-7% via bullion rather than through a gold ETF or an ETF that invests in gold mining stocks, to hedge against rising prices in the future. “While inflation has come down, we don’t think it’s going to stay down,” he said, adding he believes elevated government spending will stoke inflation again, which could make gold more appealing. David Flores Wilson, a managing partner at Sincerus Advisory, however, cautions investors to not make the mistake of believing that gold has intrinsic value and will continue to have intrinsic value. “Investors should be mindful that there have been recent periods of over 10 years where gold's return has been nearly flat prior to its run-up over the last year," Flores Wilson said. Wealthmind's Gucciardi also believes it's difficult to ascertain where the price of gold might be headed, especially in the near term. "For short-term investors, gold often comes down to timing the market, which is tricky and not based on research-backed strategies,” she said.

Title: A Strange Trip Through the Violence of the Trump Era

Time Published: 2024-10-22T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Emily Witt’s favorite drug is acid—specifically between 75 and 100 micrograms two or three hours before leaving the house. It never causes a hangover, it lasts all night, and its effects can be amplified or dulled down with other drugs. On the right amount of acid, Witt feels happy to be around others, but not so delirious that she might mistake someone she doesn’t know for a friend. LSD is also a fairly straightforward drug, hard to lace with other, more risky chemical compounds, and thus relatively safe for human consumption. Besides, “as a straight white girl from the Midwest, the archetype of the nerdy midwestern acid freak … was an established role I could comfortably inhabit.” Witt discloses this preference halfway through her new book, Health and Safety, a memoir about love, work, and Brooklyn’s rave scene in the 2010s. In 2012, after she went off the antidepressant she had been taking for many years, she quit her full-time job at a newspaper and became a freelance writer. She was at work on her book Future Sex, but was already preparing to investigate another kind of hedonism. Before turning 30, Witt had been tentative about trying recreational drugs, worried about how they might interact with her dose of Wellbutrin. But after she stopped taking the medication, she felt free to experiment. After smoking DMT for the first time with a friend, Witt became fascinated by the concept of altered consciousness. “That this cognitive experience could be generated by the interaction of my brain with a chemical found in plants amazed me,” she explains at the book’s outset. “That our biology enabled us to trip could not be an accident. I wanted to understand more.” At first, Health and Safety appears to be, like Future Sex, an entertaining, provocative, first-person reported book about the subcultures surrounding a recreational activity. Health and Safety is not quite the scientific and cultural history that Michael Pollan offered in How to Change Your Mind; nor is it as experimental as fellow raver McKenzie Wark’s Raving, an informal, sometimes diaristic book that explains what it feels like to stave off gender dysphoria by letting loose on the dance floor. Witt has written something more expansive, borrowing elements of both genres. It is both a researched history of drugs and electronic music and a firsthand account of consumption and escapism. But it’s also an exploration of how one squares extended periods of partying with an otherwise conventional adult life—with its commitments to long-term partnership and full-time work. While Witt’s work sometimes covers the culture of drugs and dancing, she has also reported on pressing social and political issues: school shootings, police brutality, the alt-right. That work turns Health and Safety into something much more complex than a meditation on dancing and drugs. Namely, it is a book concerned with how people express their political frustration; how they take it out on others, and how they channel it into their everyday lives and personal relationships. When Witt sets out on her drug journey, she doesn’t “understand the point of being on a psychedelic at a bar or a party.” At first, her experimentation isn’t about meeting people, or immersing herself in music. Only later does the research swallow her whole. Eventually, the end of the workday and the start of the night become indistinguishable, even if she is closing her laptop and sliding on her sneakers. After trying DMT, she samples everything she can get her hands on: ayahuasca, acid, MDMA, magic mushrooms, ketamine. She reads books about drugs, learns about appropriate dosages and interactions, attends drug conferences, and goes to Burning Man. (This last one is a two-for-one research project, as the festival is an oasis known both for tripping and “consent tents.”) The drugs, at first, aren’t about meeting people, but inevitably she does. At the first ayahuasca ceremony she goes to in upstate New York, she meets an attractive guy named Matt who is really into mushrooms and self-help. She dates him for a couple years despite never really liking him that much, and their relationship is fading when she meets someone who, for the book’s purposes, she calls Andrew: a raver who makes music and organizes his life around partying. She and Andrew do drugs together and go to parties together. They fall in love, and he introduces her to a whole new set of ravers who go out in Brooklyn, upstate, and Berlin to dance to techno and house D.J.s. “My world oriented itself like a compass toward a magnet,” she writes of Andrew. “Toward his tastes, his friends, the social scene I wanted to inhabit.” But where the story really starts to gain traction and where the book’s subhed—“a breakdown”—begins to make sense is when Witt’s work as a journalist moves to the forefront and the partying fades into the background. In 2018, she interviews for a job at The New Yorker and is sent to Parkland, Florida, to write about the aftermath of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Trump is president, the culture wars are heating up, and increasingly, she is covering what can only be described as “the violence beat.” She travels back to her hometown of Minneapolis, where an anti-Muslim activist interrupts an Ilhan Omar campaign event with her screams. She attends a Trump rally in Houston where supporters carry AR-15s and tell her that immigrants are “flooding into America to loaf, steal, and sell fentanyl.” She goes to Kenosha, where Kyle Rittenhouse kills two protesters. She becomes immersed in dark stories that would keep any sane person up at night. Coming back to Andrew and her local joints in Bushwick allows her to “forget about America and its problems,” if only for a little while. These are the kinds of stories Witt is working on when Covid-19 hits Brooklyn, in the aftermath of the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, and the reignition of the Black Lives Matter movement across the country. The pandemic dramatically upends nightlife, taking away the community and outlet that ravers, Witt included, once had to blow off steam. D.J.s move into Zoom squares and stream their music on online platforms for fans, but “club music without the club was devoid of so much of its purpose.” The new slowness of life, however, also helps Witt come to the realization that her “most transcendent drug experiences were probably behind me” anyway. She thinks about leaving New York, and perhaps becoming a mother while she still can. Meanwhile, her work as a journalist is only becoming more important—and more frustrating to Andrew, who is depressed, disengaged, stung by the loss of his lifeline, and also a little resentful of Witt’s career. Journalists, he comments, “made their names by piggybacking on acts of violence and injustice.” It’s with this attitude that Andrew grudgingly joins Witt at a Black Lives Matter protest in the Bronx, where he is beaten up and eventually taken into custody by the cops. Witt, in a fit of panic, escapes the violence with her press pass. Everything goes downhill from here. Andrew is jolted into action after getting released from jail with minor injuries. He becomes fixated on the way that cops violated him. He starts researching policing strategies and decides he wants to order protective gear from Amazon. He has what turns out to be a manic break, and his resentment blooms into anger. As their relationship slowly falls apart, Andrew harasses her with text messages, reveals details about other women he’s slept with (they had an open relationship), threatens to change the locks on their apartment, calls her “a Karen” and “a cop,” and pees on the couch in her office. At one point, he becomes convinced that anyone who thinks he needs help—friends in their circle, his own mother—only thinks as much because Witt told them lies. He takes on a reactionary mode Witt describes as “a Trumpian logic.” All the while, she is trying to report on City Council meetings in New York and protests in Louisville. Adrenaline accumulates in this part of the book, as one begins to feel the nearly visceral way that violence comes to define Witt’s life at this moment, the dynamics of her relationship refracting the angry and emotional political climate. “The stagnation of the previous month,” she writes, “had been replaced by a new, vicious energy, and righteous political anger that I could not seem to sufficiently meet or respond to.” The sentence describes Andrew’s behavior after he is released from jail, but it could just as well characterize that peculiar moment in history, when social isolation, layoffs, and deaths from disease and political violence fed emotions and reactions at a rate too fast to appropriately calibrate in real time. On Twitter, Trump called Covid the “Chinese virus,” and his supporters followed with even worse slurs; in St. Louis, Patricia and Mark McCloskey pointed guns at protesters; and in Minneapolis, an anti-government collective called Unicorn Riot burned down the Third Precinct of the city’s police department. Trump and his supporters had primed the country perfectly for this zenith of anger, Witt suggests through the patterns of her own reporting. “I was writing the same story over and over; and recent history was mutating and becoming recombinant,” she writes. Kyle Rittenhouse replayed the vigilante violence of George Zimmerman, while the internet fostered a supercharged combination of Alex Jones and the homophobic hate group Westboro Baptist Church. In narrating Andrew’s descent into rage, Witt startingly captures the mood of the Covid years: a period when many took part in a mass competition to see who could be the most righteously outraged, each performing in a global morality pageant. “He spoke not with his own words but in the borrowed language of racism and trauma,” she writes of Andrew after he is released from jail and crowned with a newfound martyrdom. “Which in that time was the most unassailable language a person could deploy.” Andrew is frustrated by the system and his claustrophobia. Without a way to vent those feelings, Witt, with her “elite media job,” becomes a target. “Discarding me, had become, for him, an act of ideological purity,” she writes. “He had cast me as a stand-in for the failure of liberalism.” Andrew’s angry words get into her head, and force her to question her own conception of herself: “I was left to convince myself of the integrity of my politics, which I was incapable of doing, because of course I was culpable.” Andrew’s comments about her opportunism felt at points too obvious to be worth her energy. But, she allows, he “had national opinion on his side.” The conundrum raises the question of what we owe, as writers, to people when we are reporting on violence—physical, emotional, or otherwise. Is what journalists do in fact, as Janet Malcolm famously proposed, “morally indefensible”? Or, as Andrew seems to indicate, is a reporter just “ideal terrain” for “misguided virtue signaling”? The answer is not exactly clear, and finding it is not really Witt’s goal, either. For, after all, Health and Safety does not attempt to define stability, health, or safety. Rather the book is about striving for all those states of being in a tumultuous, difficult, and violent period. Dancing on drugs for 15 hours at a time may seem to some an irresponsible way to deal with reality. But when you revisit those unpredictable and dangerous moments of lockdown, the nightlife scene starts to look like one of the few places that still made sense.

Title: Why sticking to a rigid product roadmap might be killing your product, and how to escape?
URL: https://www.mindtheproduct.com/why-sticking-to-a-rigid-product-roadmap-might-be-killing-your-product-and-how-to-escape/
Time Published: 2024-10-22T07:00:00Z
Full Content:
In this article, Sapnil Bhatnagar, a technical product manager, shares his approach when developing a product roadmap and his own FLEX Roadmap Model. Sapnil is a Technical Product Manager specializing in Digital AI SaaS products, based in London, UK. With deep expertise in product strategy development, product vision and implementation through agile methodologies. Product development is evolutionary! New prioritization frameworks popping up every week, a new competitor feature that just launched, or an idea generated during your sweet nap time can hamper your ability to stick to a roadmap which was well crafted 6 months ago. To plan an escape from this vicious cycle and engage in re-prioritization we product managers can sometimes become too rigid with our product roadmaps, even becoming a cause of our own misery. Product roadmaps are often seen as the holy grail of planning and execution. They provide a sense of direction, help align teams, and give stakeholders a clear view of what's coming next. They serve as a guiding light for executive leaderships to manage and develop forecasts on resourcing and fill the funding winter if it comes! However, when product managers cling too tightly to these roadmaps, they risk stifling innovation, missing market opportunities, and ultimately, killing their product. This article explores why flexibility in product planning is crucial and presents a framework for striking the right balance between structure and adaptability. It's easy to understand why we product managers might be tempted to stick religiously to our roadmaps: However, in my experience, this rigidity comes at a significant cost. Let's examine the four key issues with rigid product roadmaps: Markets evolve rapidly. New competitors emerge, customer preferences shift, and technologies advance. A rigid roadmap can blind you to these changes, causing you to build features that may have been relevant when you planned them but are obsolete by the time they're released. During the course of my existing engagement in running a B2B product development, there was a radical shift in compliance requirements from the regulatory agencies, leading to accommodation of a critical reporting feature, if not done, it would have led to a big compliance risk. I acknowledged that if the product roadmap was not pivoted to cater to these immediate needs we may be looking at huge fines in a year’s time. Regulatory situations cannot always be forecasted; hence Product Managers are required to instrument their roadmap plan to accommodate uncertainties. Industry case study: Meta's horizon worlds (2022-2023) Meta (formerly Facebook) heavily invested in the metaverse (Zuckerberg’s new gig), particularly its virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, believing it to be the next big tech frontier, However, the market was misread, the product failed to align with current market demand and user expectations. Outcome: When teams are too focused on delivering pre-planned features, they may miss opportunities for creative problem-solving or breakthrough ideas that could dramatically improve the product. Innovation often comes from unexpected places, and rigid roadmaps leave little room for exploration. Though, being careful with innovation to not hamper the time to release is also important, it’s all about striking the right balance! Industry Case Study: Intel's Chip manufacturing delays (2022-2023) Intel, once a leader in semiconductor manufacturing, fell behind competitors due to delays in developing new chip technologies, Internal bureaucracy and a focus on existing technologies stifled innovation in advanced chip manufacturing processes. Outcome: Sticking to outdated plans means investing time and money into features that may not provide value. This inefficiency can be costly, especially for start-ups and small companies with limited resources. Case in point was my time at leading product development for a ML and data science augmentation project, where resources were being trained on-the-job, hence, sticking to training plans which were relevant to feature developments which were discovered and deemed relevant six months ago were no longer relevant and may even interject with productivity if followed. Industry case study: Amazon's Alexa division (2022) Amazon heavily invested in its Alexa voice assistant technology, believing it would drive significant revenue through voice shopping and other services, Though, the division struggled to monetize per projections leading to layoffs in the space. Despite having over 100 million Alexa-enabled devices sold, only a small percentage of users made purchases through voice commands Outcome: Talented product developers and engineers thrive on solving real problems. If they're forced to work on features they know are no longer relevant or valuable, it can lead to frustration and decreased motivation. Everyone likes to be creative at times, if the creative space is taken out of the metric, demotivation sulks in faster than expected! Industry case study: Twitter's mass layoffs and policy changes (2022-2023) Following Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, the company underwent dramatic changes in leadership, policies, and workforce, with rapid policy shifts, mass layoffs, and public disputes in play, employee motivation went to an all time low, with flurry of organic and inorganic attrition. Outcome: To address these issues and implement solutions which can deliver quick fast and can scale, Over the years I developed my own FLEX Roadmap Model: F - Focus on outcomes L - Learn continuously E - Experiment rapidly X - X-ray vision (transparency) Let's explore each component of this model and how it can be implemented: Instead of detailing specific features months in advance, organize your roadmap around themes or high-level objectives. This approach provides direction while allowing flexibility in how you achieve your goals. The solution will become easier if you as a product manager can take proactive steps in coaching your leadership teams on Rolling-Wave planning. High level focus areas: Implementation: 1.1 Develop a high level view on product strategy 1.2 Compartmentalize your product strategy into product focus areas 1.3 Break product focus areas into product features 2.1 Proceed with Rolling wave planning as ideas on product features become clear 2.2 Start execution through ‘Feature driven development’ At some point we have all been hostages to a stringent deadline, immediate needs of accommodating priority and dry Microsoft Project Plans, dreading to update those plans and convincing executives on why the updates are not clearly documented can be taxing! Here, agile comes to your rescue! (Agile by design advocates continuous improvements and continuous feedback loops, Agile also promotes failing early, your Definition of Done can change and evolve, hence, keep making changes to your DoD as your product development continues and expands and you collect more and more feedback) Hence, as a product manager your starting point should be to create formal channels for collecting and analyzing customer feedback and enabling a smooth window to augment those feedbacks into your development, once you can achieve this, you will have a solid reasoning for ‘Why the plan needs to change?’ Always, make it a priority to incorporate customer input into your roadmap decisions and share the roadmaps as frequently as possible; Even better, set up a fortnightly, roadmap review call to maintain transparency, it has always worked flawlessly in my case, and there’s no reasoning why it shouldn’t work for yours! High level focus areas: Implementation: 3.1 Establish full scale Agile framework on your product delivery by advocating 3.2 Setup an achievable definition of done early on to avoid last minute surprises 4.1 Use metrics and dashboards to validate your product decisions focussing majorly on feature importance, feature touchpoints. 4.2 Ensure to develop these metrics in collaboration with your customers and product teams to capture the most accurate results. Intelligent fact: Do you know only 6% of the product features are actually ever used regularly by your customers as part of their customer journey? While sticking to pre-defined agenda and objectives is necessary, most value is created when teams experiment and fail. As a product manager I have always encouraged my team to run small experiments and develop alternate prototypes. Building a reward structure and healthy competition can lead to exceptional results, experimentation also helps validate assumptions before committing significant resources to a feature. (Try using Six Thinking Hats and 5 Whys concept to assess right experimentation and driving clarity) High level focus areas: Implementation: 5.1 Allocate specific time (~10%) in each sprint for your team to collectively brainstorm on ideas and refine generated ideas 5.2 Enable idea plotting to capture themes and pick top three ideas for implementation in subsequent delivery 6.1 Validate the implemented ideas through release in a small subset, thus enabling consumer experimentation 6.2 Swiftly discard unused ideas (features) which do not pull in positive outcomes (financial/user experience) within first 60 days I think 70% of the product manager’s job revolves around driving clarity, fostering clarity amidst uncertain and ambiguous environments is a mountain in itself. When the objective is unclear and ideas are floating all over the place, bringing in a structure and a ‘How to’ guide makes a huge impact! When you do need to adjust the roadmap, be transparent about the reasons with your team, drive transparency through guidelines by pointing towards the incremental value and enable collaborative sessions! (MIRO works best here) This will help stakeholders understand the value of flexibility, eventually augmenting your roadmap with achievable product's overall goals. High Level Focus Areas: Implementation: Step 7.1: Use custom or standard templates to conduct monthly product performance review focussing on user base and financial metrics Step 7.2: Close changes and document release notes formally month on month Release your product roadmaps in your product circle and consumer base enabling positive user experience and product acceptance It's important to note that abandoning structure entirely is not the answer. The key is to find a balance between providing direction and maintaining flexibility. While roadmaps are valuable tools for product development, they should be viewed as living documents rather than inflexible mandates. By embracing the FLEX Roadmap Model you're not just saving your product – you're setting it up to thrive in an ever-changing market landscape. Remember, the most successful products are often those that can adapt quickly to change. By loosening your grip on rigid roadmaps and implementing a more agile approach to product planning, you ensure that your product remains relevant, competitive, and truly valuable to your customers.

Title: Oklo Stock Price Levels to Watch as Nuclear Energy Startup Surges 22% to Record High

Time Published: 2024-10-22T02:06:41Z
Full Content:
Shares in Oklo (OKLO) are likely to remain on watchlists after soaring to a new record high Monday as investors continue piling into the Sam Altman-backed Nuclear energy startup. The stock has more than doubled over the past month on growing consensus among analysts that nuclear energy-related companies will benefit from big tech hyperscalers turning to the energy source to power artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. The stock gained 22% on Monday to close at $22.31. In September, Microsoft (MSFT) announced a 20-year deal to provide nuclear power for the tech giant's data centers, while Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google have also recently signed nuclear deals to meet their growing energy requirements. Below, we take a closer look at Oklo’s chart and use technical analysis to point out several key price levels to watch out for. Since breaking out from a falling wedge on above-average volume last month, Oklo's stock has trended sharply higher. Moreover, share turnover has surged in recent trading sessions, indicating strong buying conviction behind the bullish move. The relative strength index (RSI) confirms positive price momentum with a reading above 80, though the indicator also warns of extremely overbought conditions that could lead to near-term declines in the stock. Let’s look at a potential upside price target and identify three key support levels that could come into play during periods of profit taking. We can forecast a bullish price target by using a bars pattern, a technique that analyzes prior trends on the chart to project future moves. In this case, we’ll extract Oklo’s trending period from September to October and overlay that move from prior peaks in the stock around $16. The analysis, which forecasts a target of around $35, assumes the stock may be in the process of following a basic Elliot Wave pattern with five distinct swings playing out. During an initial pullback, investors should keep an eye on the $16 level mentioned above. This area on the chart sits well positioned to find support near a horizontal line connecting a range of comparable trading levels between April and October. A close below this level could see the shares retrace to around $12.25, where they may attract buying interest near several peaks and troughs that formed on the chart throughout April and May. A deeper fall may lead to a retest of lower support near the $9.50 area, a location just below the 200-day moving average where bargain hunters could look for buying opportunities around a period of July consolidation and this month’s retracement low.

Read more We initiate coverage on Hyundai Motor India (HMIL) with REDUCE (TP of Rs1,750, at ~23x core Sep-26E PER, similar to MSIL) amid a lackluster ~5% EPS CAGR over FY24-27E. HMIL has established a strong franchise in India; however, lack of major launches (key growth driver historically in PVs) over the next 12-18M, muted ~5% capacity CAGR, higher royalty, and lower treasury income are likely to restrict EPS growth. While MSIL (REDUCE) also faces similar near-term growth challenges, we prefer it over HMIL given its catch-up on operational and financial metrics (even on lower SUV mix) with a much diversified product and powertrain mix and a higher growth optionality (potential small-car recovery, aggressive 8% capacity CAGR, 7-seater SUV launch in H2FY26E, and 10 new models by 2030) driving a superior 6%/10% revenue/EPS CAGR over FY24-27E. Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) shares listed at ₹1,934 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) today, marking a discount of 1.3 per cent to its issue price of ₹1,960. The stock further declined to ₹1,923.25 in early trading, down 0.56 per cent from its opening price. On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the shares opened at ₹1,931.00. The ₹27,870 crore initial public offering (IPO), the largest in India’s history, had received a lukewarm response during its three-day subscription period.

Read more pic1.jpg Hyundai Motor India Limited’s IPO listed at ₹1,934, marking a 1.33% loss against its issue price of ₹1,960, which was largely in line with expectations. The IPO witnessed a moderate subscription, with an overall bid of 2.3 times. The subdued grey market premium (GMP) of ₹67 (3.42%) ahead of listing had already indicated limited enthusiasm for listing gains, and the company’s fully priced valuation contributed to the muted debut. Despite the discounted listing, Hyundai Motor India’s strong fundamentals, being the second-largest passenger vehicle manufacturer in India and its strategic focus on the SUV segment, continue to support its long-term growth prospects. Investors who entered with a long-term perspective may consider holding the stock, as future performance will likely be driven by the company’s competitive market position and product innovations.

This will trigger an open offer of 26%. Orient Cement has a total capacity of 8.5mmt in South and West market while it has 8.1mmt of ready to execute projects. It also has a clinker capacity of 5.6mtpa which is expected to be increased to 11.5mtpa in near term. This acquisition would take the Adani’s consolidated capacity to 97.4mtpa and targeting 100+mtpa by FY25. Acquisition translates to a EV/t of $114, which is a significant premium to the recent acquisition of Kesoram and Sanghi Cements. We don’t see it a big value accretive for Ambuja.

Title: Head of World’s Largest Sovereign Wealth Fund Sees a Problem With the A.I. Hype

Nicolai Tangen is no stranger to mass amounts of wealth—he oversees around $2 trillion in assets as CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. But even Tangen is unsure about the sheer scale of the ongoing A.I. stock rally. “It means that there is a risk in the stock market which we have never seen before,” he said during an episode of the Financial Times’ Unhedged podcast last week.

You can opt out anytime. Norway’s wealth fund, initially established to invest the nation’s oil revenue, owns nearly 1.5 percent of all shares in the world’s publicly traded companies and is allowed to spend up to 3 percent of its holdings annually. Many of these investments are in the tech sector, with the fund holding around a 1 percent stake in Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). The fund’s investments in these companies, combined with its stakes in Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), total at around $174 billion. While Tangen’s fund might be a major investor in companies at the forefront of A.I., that doesn’t mean he isn’t concerned about them. Warning that “we are heading for a period of low returns,” the former hedge fund manager who founded the London-based AKO Capital pointed to the dominance of A.I.-focused companies in the market as cause for concern. “The leadership in the market is very narrow, always focusing on companies with some kind of A.I. connection,” he told Unhedged, noting that the ten largest companies in the U.S. now account for roughly 20 percent of the U.S. S&P 500 Index in terms of market value. An A.I. revolution ushered in by the 2022 unveiling of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot has been an unprecedented boon for Big Tech. Demand for the new technology propelled the likes of Nvidia and Microsoft above $3 trillion market caps and pushed other tech companies to the top of the stock market, leading some to fret that an A.I. crash could have devastating financial impacts. This concentration “is absolutely worrying,” said Tangen, who noted the interconnectedness between the A.I. leaders at the top as another alarming development. The Dutch company ASML makes machines to produce computer chips, used by the likes of Nvidia, which subsequently sells its A.I. accelerators to the likes of Amazon, Meta and Microsoft, he said. “There are very few companies tied into them, and they are getting bigger and bigger and more and more important,” he said. The majority of these companies notably stem from America. Europe’s lack of major tech companies, meanwhile, is a factor Tangen doesn’t believe will change anytime soon. “In America, you have lots of A.I. and little regulation, and in Europe you have little A.I. and lots of regulation.” The European Union’s A.I. Act, for example, has emerged as one of the broadest efforts to regulate the technology. Going forward, Tangen is particularly concerned about the vulnerability of A.I. when it comes to geopolitical risks. “The main thing to watch is the relationship between the U.S. and China,” said the wealth manager, noting the potential implications a disturbance in this relationship could have on America’s reliance on Taiwan and its chip supply chains. Such chips play an outsized role in everyday life, from “phones, toasters, cars, dishwashers. Just everything,” he said. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Housing Stocks Fall as Rate-Cut Outlook Softens

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed to start the new trading week as earnings season intensifies. Meanwhile, Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari told a town hall that he expects interest-rate cuts to proceed moderately over the next few quarters. However, he indicated that unexpected weakness in the labor market could prompt more rapid rate reductions. The prospect of rates remaining elevated for longer contributed to an uptick in the 10-year Treasury yield. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% on Monday. The Dow tumbled 0.8%, ending a three-day winning streak for the blue-chip index. After trading in negative territory for most of the session, the Nasdaq recovered in the afternoon to close with a daily gain of 0.3%. Concerns about the pace of interest-rate reductions weighed on stocks in the housing sector, with the likelihood of mortgage rates staying high dampening the outlook for real estate. Shares of construction materials supplier Builders FirstSource (BLDR) tumbled 5.2%, making the steepest loss of any S&P 500 constituent. Shares of homebuilders Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI) were down 4.4% and 4.2%, respectively, while numerous real estate investment trusts (REITs) also lost ground. Cigna (CI) shares fell 4.7% following reports about a resumption of merger negotiations with rival health insurer Humana (HUM). The two companies engaged in talks last year but failed to strike a deal, but according to Bloomberg, they are in the early stages of a new round of negotiations. Cigna announced in January that it plans to sell its Medicare Advantage business to Health Care Service Corporation, suggesting that the divestment could make a potential merger with Humana more palatable to regulators. Humana shares slipped 2.5% on Monday. Shares of Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), a semiconductor maker specializing in power management solutions, lost 3.6%. Recent reports indicated that Monolithic Power insiders unloaded more than $300 million worth in shares of the company. Investors often interpret insider sales as a sign of limited confidence in a firm's future performance. Monday's top performance in the S&P 500 belonged to shares of Kenvue (KVUE), the consumer health company that completed its separation from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in August, which surged 5.5%. The gains followed multiple reports that activist investor Starboard Value had accumulated a significant position in Kenvue, home to well-known brands like Benadryl and Band-Aid. According to The Wall Street Journal, the hedge fund aims to push for changes to help boost Kenvue's stock price. Shares of artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor behemoth Nvidia (NVDA) added 4.1% in the wake of positive commentary from several Wall Street analysts. Bank of America and investment research firm CFRA boosted their price targets on Nvidia stock last week. Analysts at Bank of America highlighted Nvidia's partnerships with companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Accenture (ACN), solidifying Nvidia's position as a go-to collaborator in the enterprise AI space. Boeing (BA) shares jumped 3.1% after the company reached a tentative deal with the union representing its machinists, potentially ending a strike that has persisted for five weeks and constrained the aircraft maker's operations. According to a statement released over the weekend, the union plans to vote Wednesday on the new deal, which includes a 35% increase in wages over four years—a step up from Boeing's prior offers but still below the union's stated goal of 40%.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares surged Monday to close at a fresh high, just a week after the company set its previous record. The chipmaker's stock price gained more than 4% to finish at $143.71 Monday, and has nearly tripled in value this year as demand boomed for the company’s chips to support artificial intelligence (AI). Despite the stock's meteoric rise, most analysts believe the stock still has further to climb. All but one of the 22 analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha had a "buy" or equivalent rating on the stock as of Monday, with a consensus price target of $154.19, up from $152.41 a week ago and implying over 7% upside from Monday's closing price. Late last week, Bank of America analysts lifted their price target for Nvidia even higher to $190 from $165, calling it a “top AI pick.” The analysts pointed to recent comments from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who said that demand for the company's Blackwell AI chips is “insane” in an interview with CNBC earlier this month.

Nvidia (NVDA+0.52%) closed at a record high Monday as Wall Street anticipates Big Tech’s earnings report in November. The chipmaker’s stock rose 4.14% and closed at $143.71 per share, and its shares continued climbing in after-hours trading. Earlier in the day, the company’s stock reached an intraday record high of $142.46, according to Barron’s. Nvidia’s shares are up 198.34% so far this year. Friday, Bank of America (BAC+0.73%) raised its price target for the chipmaker to $190 from $165, citing “confidence in NVDA’s competitive lead and generational opportunity.” Research analyst Vivek Arya cited “recent industry events,” including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) (TSM-1.46%) earnings results and Advanced Micro Devices’ AI event, as part of the reason for the price target lift in the Bank of America Global Research report last week. “We also highlight a growing presence of AI in enterprise, where NVDA is the partner of choice,” Arya said. Last week, Nvidia set an intraday high after TSMC beat earnings expectations. The chipmaker’s stock briefly climbed over 3% to set an intraday record of $140.89 per share Thursday. The stock’s last record intraday high was on June 20, when it reached $140.76 per share. Meanwhile, TSMC reported revenue of NT$759.69 billion, or $23.5 billion, for the quarter ending Sept. 30. Third-quarter revenue was up 36% year over year in U.S. dollars, TSMC said, and was up 12.9% from the previous quarter. Shares of Nvidia fell over 4% last Tuesday after closing at a record high $138.07 the previous day. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries.

Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) climbed 10 basis points to 4.18%, the highest level since July. Whether records keep rolling in rides in large part on corporate results in the coming days. Earnings season ramps up this week, as over 100 S&P 500 companies are lined up to report. So far, 80% of third quarter updates from those on the benchmark have topped the mark. Investors are on edge for Tesla's (TSLA) report on Wednesday, after its robotaxi unveiling fell short of expectations. The EV maker is the highlight of the week amid questions about Big Tech performance, even after Netflix's (NFLX) strong kickoff to the megacap season. General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola (KO), American Airlines (AAL), and UPS (UPS) are among several other big hitters on the earnings docket this week. Boeing (BA) faces a double-whammy on Wednesday, when it's expected to release earnings at the same time workers vote on whether to accept a tentative deal agreed with the union to end a five-week strike.

Streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) also rose to a record high during Monday's session. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: A wild weekend on the campaign trail underlined two key trends of the 2024 campaign cash race: Kamala's Harris's outsized fundraising prowess and Donald Trump's reliance on an array of friendly billionaires. Vice President Harris's campaign out-raised Trump by over 3 to 1 in September to cap off a less than three-month sprint as a candidate that saw her raise an unprecedented $1 billion. Trump's own formal operation has lagged behind. But the former president and his allies have tried to make up the difference with their own flood of billionaire donations directed to outside groups supporting his candidacy. Read more here. Dan Howley reports: The smartphone industry is banking on AI to reaccelerate device sales after years of slowing growth. But to do that, it’ll have to give consumers a reason to pony up for new phones more often. Qualcomm (QCOM) is aiming for its latest smartphone chips to do just that, adding a number of new on-board AI capabilities it says will allow you to do things like virtually adjust the lighting in your video calls in real-time and allow your device to recognize real-world objects without having to access the web. On Monday, Qualcomm shares were down almost 2%. Read more here. An early trend is emerging through the first part of quarterly earnings reports. For the first time since 2020, companies that beat Wall Street's expectations on both revenue and earnings are seeing larger stock moves than companies that miss on both metrics. Through earnings from 71 companies in the S&P 500, companies that beat expectations on both metrics are seeing an average stock gain of 3.15% over the next day, above the 1.49% average seen since 2000, per research from Bank of America. Meanwhile, companies that miss on revenue and earnings estimates are seeing a 2.61% decline in their stock the next day, below the average since 2000 of 2.44%. "As large-cap Tech earnings near, the potential for large earnings reactions to continue strengthens the case for owning Tech vol through the end of October," Bank of America Securities team of strategists wrote in a note on Monday morning. Morgan Stanley chief US equity strategist Mike Wilson opined on the topic in a note to clients on Sunday night as well. "Bottom line, dispersion between stocks and even within sectors is likely to remain high as the market appears to be delineating clearly between earnings beats and misses," Wilson wrote. Pras Subramanian reports: Investors are expecting more upbeat results from GM (GM) when the automaker reports earnings on Tuesday after the company raised its guidance for a second time earlier this year on the back of decent US sales. Questions around GM’s EV business and inventory management, however, will be in focus. For the third quarter, GM is expected to report revenue of $44.69 billion per Bloomberg consensus, sequentially lower than last quarter’s nearly $48 billion, but to be expected given the second quarter’s historically strong sales. GM’s Q3 revenue is expected to be higher than a year ago. Read more here. Netflix (NFLX) shares hit all-time highs on Monday, extending gains from last week when the streaming giant posted a better-than-expected quarterly print. The stock briefly touched a new high of $773 during the session before paring gains. Gold and silver gains show no sign of slowing down as investors continue to pour into precious metals. Gold futures (CG=F) rose 0.8% on Monday to touch an intraday high above $2,750 per ounce. Silver futures (SI=F) gained more than 3% to briefly top $34 per ounce, a 12-year high. Both metals have outperformed the broader markets. Gold bullion is up roughly 26% and silver has risen nearly 35% since the start of 2024, compared with the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gain of 19%. Central banks have been buying up the yellow metal, and investors have been increasingly entering physically backed gold ETFs amid expectations of lower interest rates. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Disney (DIS) plans to announce its next CEO in early 2026, the first timeline the company has publicly given for appointing a successor to current chief Bob Iger. The media giant made the announcement on Monday while simultaneously revealing that current board member and former Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman will serve as the board's new chairman, effective Jan. 2, 2025. He will exit his role as executive chairman at Morgan Stanley on Dec. 31. “A critical priority before us is to appoint a new CEO, which we now expect to announce in early 2026," Gorman said in a press release. "This timing reflects the progress the Succession Planning Committee and the Board are making, and will allow ample time for a successful transition before the conclusion of Bob Iger’s contract in December 2026."

Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Dallas Fed president Lorie Logan reiterated on Monday that she sees policymakers lowering interest rates "gradually". She cited an increased risk that the job market could worsen and a danger that inflation could still heat up again. "If the economy evolves as I currently expect, a strategy of gradually lowering the policy rate toward a more normal or neutral level can help manage the risks and achieve our goals," Logan said in a speech at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association's annual meeting in New York. Logan said the economy is "strong and stable" but that "meaningful uncertainties" remain in the outlook. Read more here.

Boeing (BA) stock jumped as much as 4.5% in Monday's premarket on news that the aircraft manufacturer has reached a tentative labor deal with workers who have been on strike for more than one month. The contract would raise pay 35% over four years and increase Boeing's 401(k) contributions, but it would not reinstate pension plans — a major union demand. Analysts estimate the contract could lead to an additional $1 billion in wage-related expenses for the company. The union will vote on the contract on Wednesday, the same day Boeing reports its quarterly earnings. Analysts expect the plane maker to report a loss per share of $1.50, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Boeing has struggled since an airplane part ripped off one of its 737 Max 9 planes during a flight in January. Shares are down over 40% this year. Of the Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, some 19 recommend buying shares, while 11 have a Hold rating, and three say to sell.

Title: Wall Street keeps raising price targets for sky-high Nvidia stock. Here's why analysts are still so bullish.

Nvidia stock is trading at record highs, but that's not deterring top Wall Street analysts from being bullish. Bank analysts have been hiking their price targets for the chip titan in recent weeks, predicting more upside even as the stock has seen a meteoric rise over the past year. Shares traded above $142 each on Monday, hitting a fresh record as investors gear up for the company's next earnings report on November 20. The stock is up 193% year-to-date. But Nvidia still has plenty of room to climb, according to forecasters. They point to signs of frenzied demand for the company's AI-enabling GPU chips and a long list of partnerships with enterprise "hyperscalers." Here's what some of Wall Street's top forecasters are saying about their bullish outlook for the stock. BofA strategists raised their price target for the chipmaker to $190 from $165 per share last week, implying another 35% upside from the stock's current levels. The upside will be driven by Nvidia's competitive advantage over other chipmakers, as well as the "generational opportunity" in the AI market, which is expected to grow to $400 billion, analysts said in a note. "Driven by our increased NVDA Data Center Compute outlook, we now see the AI accelerator market growing to $280bn by CY27E (and over time toward $400bn+) from just ~$45bn in CY23. AI models (demand) continue to evolve," the bank added. Strategists pointed to positive signs for Nvidia's future chip demand, including commentary from other tech firms and comments from CEO Jensen Huang, who described the demand for Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip as "insane." Nvidia, meanwhile, also has a number of "underappreciated" business partnerships with firms like Accenture and Microsoft, which should contribute to the upside potential. "We also highlight a growing presence of AI in enterprise, where NVDA is the partner of choice," the bank said. "NVDA's engagements span multiple verticals (e.g., Accenture, ServiceNow, Microsoft), and offerings such as AI Foundry, AI Hubs, NIMs are key levers to its AI leadership, not only on the hardware side but also on systems/ecosystems side." Goldman analysts raised their price target to $150 from $135 a share, implying 6% upside from the stock's current levels. Strategists said they changed their price target after a meeting with Huang. The Nvidia CEO spoke of the company's advantage over other chipmakers, and the bank said that Nvidia's "competitive moat" is built on the firm's installed base, its innovation, and its "robust and growing" software offerings. "Although we acknowledge that the company's revenue trajectory beyond CY2025 remains uncertain, we expect the stock to perform at least consistent with estimate revisions given relative valuation multiples that remain depressed relative to history ... and the potential for a re-acceleration in fundamentals driven by the upcoming Blackwell product cycle," strategists wrote. Blackwell could also help produce several billion dollars in revenue for Nvidia, the strategists estimated. "By integrating seven chips, and each playing a role in delivering higher performance at the data center level, we view the introduction and ramp of Blackwell not only as a near- and medium-term revenue growth driver, but also a dynamic that extends Nvidia's competitive advantage. The ramp of Blackwell-based products remains on track with several billion dollars in revenue expected in the January quarter followed by further growth in April and beyond." The research firm CFRA raised its price target to $160 from $139 per share, implying a 13% upside from current levels. According to Angelo Zino, a senior equity analyst at CFRA, that's due to increased confidence that Nvidia will post better-than-expected growth, particularly as customers scramble to get their hands on the new Blackwell chip. "The higher multiple and target reflect our higher conviction that NVDA will post results that exceed our/consensus views in CY 25, as Blackwell ramps. As we previously cited, Blackwell will take greater wallet share from hyperscalers (e.g., greater GPU, CPU, networking, and software revenue) amid an AI war in the cloud," Zino wrote. Bernstein raised its price target to $155 a share shortly after the chipmaker reported its second-quarter earnings in August. Similar to other firms' forecasts, Bernstein's upside prediction is based on the success of the Blackwell GPU. "People are getting excited about the story again, especially as we approach earnings, and then year-end into next year is their new platform, Blackwell, really starts to ramp. Look, by all indications, their own commentary, all the supply checks and everything else, demand for this product just looks off the charts," Rasgon said in an interview with CNBC in early October. "This cycle, if the checks are any indication, must potentially be massive," he added. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to

Nvidia (NVDA) stock closed at a record high on Monday as Wall Street analysts held firm on their bullish positions on the stock ahead of its earnings report in November. Shares of the leading AI chipmaker rose over 4% to close at $143.71 per share. The move comes as Wall Street analysts reiterate their Buy ratings on the stock. Citing strong demand for artificial intelligence, Bank of America (BAC) on Friday raised its price target from $165 to $190 (go inside the call with analyst Vivek Arya below from the Opening Bid podcast), while investment research firm CFRA raised its price target for Nvidia last week from $139 to $160. Overall, analysts see shares rising to $148.37 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. In addition to growth in the AI market at large, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said Nvidia’s strength in the enterprise AI space — i.e., its partnerships with companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Accenture (ACN) — is another factor contributing to his higher price target. Arya said “NVDA is the partner of choice” for enterprise AI hardware and software. Wedbush analyst and Nvidia bull Dan Ives echoed that sentiment in a note to investors Sunday, writing that there is “a tidal wave of enterprise spending as AI use cases explode,” with Nvidia leading the market. Ives forecasts the AI infrastructure market to grow tenfold between now and 2027, with companies spending $1 trillion on AI capital expenditures in that time frame. “In a nutshell, we believe the stage is set for tech stocks to see another 20% move higher in 2025 with this tech bull market just hitting its next phase led by the AI Revolution,” Ives added. “In our opinion as the Fed and Powell have kicked off its aggressive rate cutting cycle, macro soft landing remains the path, and tech spending on AI remains a generational spending cycle just starting to hit the shores of the tech sector.” Despite a short-lived tumble last week and looming fears of an AI spending slowdown, Nvidia shares have risen nearly 3% over the past week and more than 20% in the last month. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said there is “insane” demand for its AI chips, which are used in data centers by Big Tech companies to power generative artificial intelligence software. Recent positive news from the company's industry partners has also boosted AI stocks across the board, including Nvidia. Micron (MU), which supplies memory chips used in Nvidia’s GPUs, and TSMC (TSM), which manufactures Nvidia’s AI chips, both surpassed Wall Street’s expectations in their recent earnings reports. The AI chip market is expected to grow 99% in 2024 and another 74% in 2025, according to consulting firm International Business Strategies, which tracks industry data. Still, there's a chance that even the slightest slowdown in Nvidia's growth could send the stock lower, as investors proved difficult to please during Big Tech's last wave of quarterly reports. Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg expect Nvidia to report third quarter earnings per share of $0.74, an 84% increase from last year. They see revenue rising 83% to $33.1 billion. Some 67 analysts have Outperform ratings on Nvidia stock, while seven maintain a Hold rating, and only one recommends selling shares. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Wave Goodbye To the Stock Market's Historic Run, Goldman Sachs Says
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/wave-goodbye-to-the-stock-market-s-historic-run-goldman-sachs-says-8731471
Time Published: 2024-10-21T18:31:20Z

The S&P 500 is on a record run this year, posting its strongest year-to-date performance since 1997. But, as analysts at Goldman Sachs argued in a note on Monday, all good things must come to an end. Goldman analysts forecast the S&P 500 will return an average of just 3% a year in the next decade, a far cry from the 13% average annual return of the last 10 years. That would rank in the bottom decile of comparable periods in the last century. It also puts the odds that stocks fail to outpace inflation at about 33%. Goldman's forecast is far below the consensus on Wall Street. According to its analysis of the publicly available capital markets assumptions of 21 asset managers, other 10-year forecasts for S&P 500 performance range from a low of 4.4% to a high of 7.4%, with the average being 6%. So why the pessimism? One of the primary causes for Goldman's concern is the market’s extreme concentration, which by their measure is near its highest level in 100 years. Concentration of this magnitude, the analysts say, makes the performance of the S&P 500 overly reliant on the earnings growth of the index's largest constituents. The 10 largest stocks in the S&P 500 currently account for about 36% of the index, far higher than at any other time in the last 40 years. These stocks have swelled in size in large part because of their exceptional earnings growth over the last two years. The Magnificent Seven—Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Tesla (TSLA)—more than doubled their earnings on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2024. History shows, however, that it's extremely difficult to sustain earnings growth at that clip. Just 11% of S&P 500 companies since 1980 have maintained double-digit sales growth for 10+ years, according to a Goldman analysis. A microscopic share (0.1%) has sustained 50%+ margins for a decade. "Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time," the analysts write. The Magnificent Seven's earnings growth already has begun to decline from its meteoric pace of the last two years. The group's profit growth is expected to decline to just over 18% in the third quarter as year-over-year comparisons become more difficult. However, growth is expected to pick up for the "Other 493," which are forecast to post double-digit earnings growth over the next five quarters, significantly narrowing the gap between those companies and the Mag Seven. The market's extreme concentration and the difficulty of sustaining earnings growth are two key reasons Goldman expects the equal-weight S&P 500 index to outperform the more widely tracked capitalization-weight, or aggregate, version over the next decade. Historically, the equal-weight index tends to outperform the aggregate index, but the last 10 years have been a different story. The aggregate index has outperformed the equal-weight by 3 percentage points a year since 2014. Goldman expects the pendulum to swing back in favor of the equal-weight index, which their model suggests will outperform by 8 percentage points annually through 2034, its most dramatic outperformance since at least 1980. The size of the outperformance may seem extreme, the analysts note. "However, the equity market has also rarely been as concentrated as it is now." The current record outperformance for the equal-weight index is 7%, which it achieved in the decades ending in 1983 and 2010. These two 10-year stretches, Goldman points out, each began when the market was at peak concentration, as it may be today.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang leapt into the top 10 of Forbes’ real-time billionaire rankings Monday, a first for the former Denny’s busboy and waiter turned perhaps the most recognizable name associated with the 2020s generative artificial intelligence boom. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang delivers a speech in Taipei in June, wearing his signature leather jacket. Huang’s net worth climbed $3.6 billion to $124.1 billion by market close, topping the fortune of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer ($122.5 billion net worth), who traded places with Huang to become the world’s 11th-richest person. The rise in Huang’s fortune came as shares of Nvidia rose 4.1% to a new all-time high of almost $144. Huang’s roughly 3.5% equity stake in Nvidia accounts for almost all of his net worth, as Huang’s slice of the $3.5 trillion Nvidia is worth $122.2 billion. Nvidia’s chief executive since the company’s inception in 1993, the 61-year-old Huang is by far the company’s largest individual shareholder even after selling $713 million worth of the stock this summer. A trio of current Nvidia board members associated with the company dating back to the early 1990s – Tench Coxe, Harvey Jones and Mark Stevens – are also billionaires. Nvidia is the leading designer of the custom AI technology needed for high-end AI applications developed by other big technology firms like Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and Tesla. The Santa Clara-based Nvidia has about an 80% share in the rapidly growing AI accelerator market, according to recent Bank of America research. Well-known in video game circles for years, Nvidia’s graphics processing units became a hot commodity as they proved to be the leading currency for large-language models like the ones behind the viral OpenAI chatbot ChatGPT, leading Huang to declare demand is so “insane” for his company’s products that customers get “really emotional.” Huang was worth just $20.6 billion as of 2022’s Forbes 400 list published two Septembers ago, meaning his wealth is up sixfold in two years time. The “insane” demand for Nvidia’s technology has translated into an explosion in Nvidia’s share price and financial performance, with its share price up more than 1,000% over the past two years and its current fiscal year profits are projected to increase 1,400% compared to the period ending Jan. 2023. Ballmer, whose fortune stems from his 34-year tenure at Microsoft, told Forbes last week he’s poured more than $100 million into his not-for-profit company USAFacts aimed at arming the public with accessible government data.

Title: Meta Quest 3S review: The next-gen VR console you can afford

No offers found When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has once again surpassed all expectations of what a standalone VR headset can be for just $299. The Meta Quest 3S is quite literally a Quest 3 with the Quest 2's lenses and display, better hand tracking and low light tracking, a new mixed reality button on the headset, and all the exclusive games the more expensive Quest 3 gets. Enthusiasts will want to spend the extra money to get the better display and lenses of the Quest 3, but everyone else will likely choose the Quest 3S because of the price, yet get very little trade-off in the process. Powerful new chipset Excellent mixed reality quality Next-gen controllers and hand tracking Thousands of games, including Quest 3 exclusives A history of excellent monthly updates from Meta Unbelievable price Older lenses produce a dull image compared to Quest 3 90-degree FoV can feel constricting compared to PSVR 2 or Quest 3 No 3.5mm audio jack Why you can trust Android Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. When the Meta Quest 3S was first leaked, the idea of having a $299 Quest 3 headset seemed preposterous. How in the world could Meta possibly deliver a headset that's $200 cheaper without sacrificing the Quest 3's power, color mixed reality vision, new controllers with advanced haptic feedback, and all the improvements to the Quest ecosystem that have happened over the next year? Somehow, they've done it. The Meta Quest 3S is a triumph in nearly every way, from its highly polished onboarding presentation to the excellent mixed reality content that's been developed over the past year. It feels like a palpable upgrade from the Quest 2 and even sports some design and UX improvements over the more expensive Quest 3. Obviously, there have to be some concessions to get to a $299 price point but there are surprisingly few. The biggest is the display stack, as it uses the same lenses and display from the Quest 2 but still features plenty of visual upgrades and tweaks. That includes a next-generation processor, improved rendering and processing, and much more. If you're looking for a next-gen VR headset upgrade from a Quest 2 at an affordable price, you've found it. The Meta Quest 3S retails for $299 and includes 128GB of storage, while the Meta Quest 3S with 256GB of storage retails for $399. Both models come in a white colorway and come with a pair of Quest 3 touch controllers, a preinstalled cloth head strap, and a preinstalled cloth facial interface. Every Meta Quest 3S comes with a free copy of Batman Arkham Shadow and 3 months of the Meta Quest Plus subscription service until April 2025. Some Meta Quest 2 accessories work on a Quest 3S, so you can keep some of those around instead of having to buy new ones. Likewise, most of the best Quest 3 accessories work on a Quest 3S, with the exception of the facial interface, which has a new design. Meta has learned a thing or two about headset comfort over the past few years, but that doesn't mean the Quest 3S is perfect. It's only a gram lighter than the Quest 3, which was a few grams heavier than the Quest 2. All of this, despite still shipping with a cloth strap that I find generally uncomfortable, although it's fine for short play sessions. The biggest problem with the cloth strap is that it rests on the top of my ears and irritates my skin rather quickly. Meta is using the same Y-shaped top strap design it launched with the Quest 3, which means it better allocates weight across the head but still doesn't work anywhere near as well as the BoboVR M3 Pro head strap does, for instance. Beyond that, though, the Quest 3S is just as comfortable as the Quest 3 out of the box and maybe even more so thanks to the new facial interface design. The new, more padded, and supple face pad that was preinstalled on the headset feels wonderful. Historically, I couldn't wait to swap out the facial interface with a third-party one, but I've been pleasantly surprised by how comfortable this one is. The headset is also 20mm slimmer than the Quest 2, so it has a weight distribution closer to your face. Quest 3 is an additional 10mm slimmer than Quest 3S. However there are still three main reasons to choose a good third-party facial interface replacement once reputable companies release them. First is hygiene. The cloth is nice and soft but also absorbs sweat. Grab a $12 pair of silicone covers for now, especially if you sweat a lot or share the headset with other people. The second reason to replace the stock facial interface is because of lens fog. I haven't had issues with it during the review period because it's been cool and dry here, but as soon as the humidity ramps up again in half a year I'll need something more breathable. For now, Meta makes an excellent breathable facial interface with semi-transparent sides. I used this one at the Quest 3S hands-on event and loved it. Third, if you use glasses, some third-party facial interfaces have built-in glasses spacing adjustments. The default Meta Quest 3 facial interface includes a way to adjust for glasses, but the one on the Quest 3S doesn't. You'll need to use the glasses spacer in the box to do this which doesn't offer as many spacing options as the Quest 3 method. That said, the new interface design makes it far easier to swap out the facial interface than any other Quest headset to date. This has been improved with every generation, so it's good to see it continue to happen. But even if you don't swap out any of these modular parts right away, I think short play sessions will be comfortable enough. Thankfully, all the best Meta Quest 3 accessories work on the Quest 3S, except for the replacement of the facial interface. You'll need one specifically made for the Quest 3S. Keep in mind that the Quest 3S does not have a 3.5mm audio jack, so if you want to use headphones instead of the excellent built-in speakers on the Quest 3S arms, I recommend picking up a pair of PrismXR Vega T1 earbuds. Regular Bluetooth earbuds or headphones won't work in VR because Bluetooth's latency is too high. This can actually make you feel sick because of an odd disconnect between what your brain hears and what it sees. In my testing, I've found that the Quest 3S has the best battery life of any modern Quest headset. On average, I got around two and a half hours of use from a single charge, with more power-hungry games like Batman Arkham Shadow bringing that down to around 2 hours. I'd say if you were planning to just use the Quest 3S with the default head strap and facial interface, this is more than enough time before any kind of fatigue sets in. Grabbing a new head strap with built-in battery like the BoboVR M3 Pro or Kiwi Design H4 will add several hours of battery life and significantly better comfort overall, making it a worthwhile $50 upgrade. If you directly compare the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S, this section holds the only real differences you'll notice. The Meta Quest 3S uses the same display and Fresnel lenses as the Meta Quest 2, so if you've only ever used a Quest 1 or Quest 2, you probably won't be particularly disappointed in the Quest 3S's display or lenses. All in all, they're fine and suit a $299 headset rather well. As with all Fresnel lenses, there's a small "sweet spot" right in the middle of each lens where you'll get the clearest view. Anything outside of this circle gets blurrier the closer you look to the edges. The Meta Quest 3S uses the same lenses and display as the Quest 2, foregoing most next-generation upgrades from the more expensive Quest 3. The 90-degree FoV on the Quest 3S's lenses feels a bit constricting compared to the substantially wider 110-degree FoV of the Quest 3. This difference cannot be understated, and it all melds together to show just how superior the lenses on the Quest 3 are. The Meta Quest 3S's lenses also adjust the same way as the Quest 2, so if you're coming from a Quest 2 you'll know exactly what to do. The only difference is that there's no 1/2/3 preset number in the middle of the lenses that changes as you adjust the spacing. Meta says it cut this mechanism to keep the manufacturing cost of the headset as low as possible, allowing it to hit that $299 price point. That being said, if you have an interpupillary distance (IPD) over 72mm you're probably going to find the Meta Quest 3S uncomfortable. If you find yourself in this boat, a 3D printed IPD expander like this one will push the lenses out a bit and help. If you plan to work in VR or use it for a lot of text-based applications, it makes more sense to spend the extra money on a Quest 3. Like the lenses, the display on the Meta Quest 3S is the same as the one on the Quest 2. It gets plenty bright, but the contrast is fairly low, the colors are a bit on the dull side, and the resolution is noticeably lower than the Quest 3's panels. As far as clarity is concerned, I'd say the resolution difference between Quest 3 and Quest 3S is similar to playing games at 1440p vs 1080p. The Quest 3S isn't as sharp, and fine detail gets a bit lost, but it's not offensively lower resolution. If there's any one area where the resolution and lenses make a big difference, it's for folks who want to work in VR. If that's going to be a big part of your headset usage, stick with the Quest 3. The Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3 use identical controllers. These new controllers ditch the LED ring and tighten up some ergonomics for a much smaller profile than the Quest 2's controllers. Tracking is still done with LEDs, though, which are situated around the controller face and handles. Tracking is enhanced through better camera positioning around the headset—particularly the lower side-mounted cameras, which can see better along the sides and below the headset than on the Quest 2—and Meta's Horizon OS, which fills in any visual tracking gaps with gyro sensor data from inside the controller and an AI algorithm that predicts hand position based on arm and shoulder movements. The Meta Quest 3S uses the same advanced controllers as the Quest 3 and are powered by a single AA battery. Each controller is powered by a single AA battery. Based on my extended usage of the Quest 3 over the past year, you'll only need to swap them out once every two months or so, depending on how often you play. I recommend picking up these cheap Amazon Basics rechargeable AA batteries for a few bucks so you can keep reusing them. Each controller has a battery door that can be swapped out for any number of excellent controller accessories, like these AMVR controller grips, which add grip and help balance the controllers better with a handy hand strap. Quest 3S also supports what's called Inside-Out Body Tracking, which only a handful of games currently support. However, developers may start to use it more now that another Quest headset supports the feature. With this, in-game character movements will feel more realistic as the headset can properly align the virtual character's torso, shoulders, and arms with your actual movements in real life. Meta Quest 3S has also been outfitted with two IR illuminators on the front, positioned on the outside of each triple camera array on the front. This is a new feature for any Quest headset and allows the Quest 3S to see completely in the dark, provided you're in a small enough room. I tested different rooms at night with the lights off, and while tracking didn't work at all in my living room, it worked perfectly in any bedroom I tried it in. Essentially, as long as the Quest 3S can see walls, it will be able to track spatial movement in the dark. Likewise, hand tracking is better than ever—particularly in low light—than with any Quest headset to date. While I found daytime tracking performance and accuracy to be essentially identical to the more expensive Quest 3, Quest 3S can also track hands in the dark. That should help significantly in some dimly lit rooms when playing hand-tracked games or during casual entertainment when you're just using your hands to navigate the UI. While you'll notice the controller differences and slimmer profile of the headset when unboxing it, nothing prepares you for the color mixed reality vision until you've tried it. It's not as clear as an Apple Vision Pro or even the Meta Quest 3 because of the lenses, but it's beyond just a generational upgrade from the Quest 2. If anything, it's like going from a 1950s black-and-white TV to a color HDTV. The Meta Quest 3S uses the same 4MP dual front-facing cameras as the Quest 3 and tends to look even brighter thanks to the lenses. Yes, Fresnel lenses aren't as crisp as the pancake lenses on Quest 3, but they allow more light in from the display giving it a distinctly brighter look. Because the lenses aren't as sharp and the display's resolution is lower, it's a bit harder to read text on a phone while wearing the headset, but this isn't a common mixed reality use case, anyway. Instead, you'll marvel at how fun games like Starship Home are. Mixed reality games allow you to turn your living room into a spaceship, defend against hordes of zombies in Drop Dead: The Cabin, or play a D&D-like board game together with other headset-wearing friends on your dining room table. When you're not viewing an augmented version of your real room, you'll be diving dungeons deep in Dungeons of Eternity, fighting bad guys in Batman Arkham Shadow, or just socializing on a Friday evening in Gorilla Tag or Orion Drift. There are thousands of games on the Meta Quest platform, and that number is growing every single month thanks to a new, more open marketplace and more VR players than ever. Of course, we maintain a list of the best Meta Quest games to give you a good starting point, and there are plenty of great ones to look forward to, like Skydance's Behemoth, Alien Rogue Incursion, Metro Awakening, and many more. All in all, Quest 3 games look a lot better than Quest 2 games, especially when they're Quest 3 exclusive. The Meta Quest 3S doesn't include a depth sensor like the Quest 3 has, but that doesn't seem to affect its mixed reality performance in my testing. As you can see in the video above, the Quest 3S is a little slower at mapping than the Quest 3 but not inordinately so. It took the Quest 3S roughly nine seconds longer to map my living room, but some of that time was because I ran into an early bug where hand tracking in some UI elements felt laggy. Realistically, it probably only took the Quest 3S around seven seconds longer to do the actual mapping, which is impressive given that it just uses cameras to do the work. Meta's Horizon OS has been notably upgraded in its mixed reality capabilities since the launch of the Quest 3 last year, including automatic room mapping and object identification that makes mixed reality effortless. Additionally, a new mixed reality button on the bottom of the Quest 3S makes it effortless to jump between virtual reality and mixed reality. It's a substantial upgrade from all prior Meta Quest headsets which required you to perform an awkward and extremely unreliable double-tap on the side of the headset. Because the VR gaming industry is relatively small compared to traditional consoles, the Meta Quest 3S's closest competition is made up of Meta headsets. The Quest 3S replaces the Quest 2 as the new standard in affordable VR. Its processor is 100% more powerful than the Quest 2, enabling it to play far richer and more detailed games and render impressive color mixed reality in your room. It's an easy recommendation to upgrade from a Quest 2 because of the price, but the full next-generation upgrade can be found in the Meta Quest 3. Compared to the Quest 3S, the Meta Quest 3 sports next-generation lenses with a 20-degree wider field of view (FoV), significantly enhanced clarity, a higher resolution display, and better contrast and colors than the Quest 3S. Surprisingly, Quest 3 doesn't include IR illuminators, so it can't play in the dark like Quest 3S. If you're a PCVR-only player, it would also make more sense to get a Quest 3 because of the enhanced clarity brought about by the lenses and display. Otherwise, if you prefer a headset with an OLED display or a much smaller headset, Bigscreen Beyond is your best bet. You should buy if... You shouldn't buy if... The Meta Quest 3S is a triumph in every regard. It's an unbelievable bargain at $299, yet it still exhibits the best mixed reality and virtual reality gaming available today. The only real compromises are the lenses and display, which are worse than the Quest 3 but not detrimentally so. If I had to compare the experience to more traditional gaming specs, I'd say it's similar to the difference between a 1080p and 4K setup. Otherwise, the Meta Quest 3S is everything you need in a VR and mixed-reality headset today. It not only offers the highest-quality standalone VR games available—including the incredible free pack-in Batman Arkham Shadow—but it also connects to any PC and can play PCVR games completely wirelessly. It's a win-win-win for anyone looking to get into VR or upgrade from an older headset. There are certainly reasons to choose a Quest 3 over a Quest 3S, but for most people, the price point and overall value of the Quest 3S make it a must-buy console this Holiday season. Get next-generation virtual reality and mixed reality games and apps with the Meta Quest 3S, a surprisingly affordable headset with capabilities beyond your imagination.

Title: Jensen Huang and Mark Zuckerberg each got $76 billion richer this year—equal to Spotify’s market cap
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/21/mark-zuckerberg-jensen-huang-net-worth-76-billion-wealth-gain-world-richest-billionaires/

Mark Zuckerberg and Jensen Huang, two of tech’s wealthiest and most famous executives, saw their net worth grow this year by more than anyone else’s on the planet. The net worth of Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, increased by $76.5 billion so far this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. Just behind Huang was Facebook cofounder and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose net worth rose by $76 billion in 2024. That is equal to or exceeds the entire market cap of some companies, such as fellow tech juggernaut Spotify and the spirits maker Diageo, which both have a market cap of $76 billion, as well as CVS ($73 billion), Target ($70 billion), and Capital One ($60 billion). Zuckerberg and Huang are now the third and 11th richest people in the world, respectively. Zuckerberg, who is behind only Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder and executive chair Jeff Bezos on Bloomberg’s rich list, has a total net worth of $204 billion, while Huang is worth $121 billion. Both Zuckerberg and Huang benefited tremendously from the standout stock performance of the companies they helm. Since the start of the year, Nvidia’s share price has surged 192% and Meta’s went up 65%. Both Meta and Nvidia are part of the so-called Magnificent Seven of mega-cap tech stocks that have powered much of the past year’s market rally. Investors have rewarded both companies for their solidified market positions—Meta in digital advertising and Nvidia in chip manufacturing—along with their AI-focused innovation pipelines and the steady leadership provided by their executives. The two executives control substantiation portions of their companies’ shares. Zuckerberg owns about 13.5% of Meta stock, amounting to about 345 million shares. Meanwhile, Huang owns between 3.5% to 4% of Nvidia, totalling about 861 million shares. Nvidia’s stock underwent a 10-to-one stock split in July. Earlier this year, Huang announced his intention to sell up to 6 million shares by the first quarter of 2025. To do so, Huang adopted a prearranged plan meant to avoid spooking investors and finished selling the 6 million shares in September, ahead of the 2025 date he had previously announced, according to regulatory filings. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: What's Behind The 15% Fall For Elevance Health Stock?

GERMANY - 2024/02/15: In this photo illustration, Elevance Health, Inc. logo seen displayed on a ... [+] tablet. (Photo Illustration by Igor Golovnov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Elevance Health (NYSE: ELV) recently reported its Q3 results, with revenues exceeding but earnings missing the consensus estimates. The company reported revenue of $44.7 billion and adjusted earnings of $8.37 per share, compared to the street estimates of $43.5 billion and $9.66, respectively. Furthermore, the company cut its full-year earnings outlook. This did not sit well with the investors and the stock plunged 14% last week. Let's dive deeper into the company's performance and its impact on the stock. As an aside, big Tesla earnings this week - one outlier scenario - Can Trump Take Tesla to $0? How Did Elevance Health Perform In Q3? Elevance Health's revenue of $44.7 billion in Q3 reflects a 5.3% y-o-y growth, led by a solid 15% rise in Carelon sales. Carelon includes Carelon Rx and Carelon Services. The segment growth can be attributed to the Paragon Healthcare acquisition earlier this year. Elevance Healthcare's total Medicaid membership base shrunk by 1.5 million to 45.8 million in Q3, due to eligibility redeterminations. Roughly, 25 million people have been disenrolled from Medicaid since April 2023. During the pandemic phase, states kept people enrolled in Medicaid with the backing of federal funding. But this policy ended in March 2023, and the states had to renew eligibility for all Medicaid enrollees. ((KFF News Release, Sep 18, 2024)) This has led to a decline in the Medicaid membership base, including that of Elevance Health. The key metric which investors were eyeing was the benefit expense ratio, which came in at 89.5%, versus 86.8% in the prior-year quarter. The adjusted operating margin contracted 70 bps to 5.3%. The company reported adjusted earnings of $8.37 per share, as compared to $8.99 in the prior year quarter. Overall, Elevance Health's Q3 performance wasn't great, despite a top-line beat. Furthermore, investors weren't happy with the outlook for both 2024 and 2025. The company lowered its 2024 earnings outlook to $33 per share, versus its prior outlook of $37 per share. For 2025, the company expects only a mid-single-digit earnings growth, implying adjusted EPS of around $35, versus the consensus estimate of around $39. It appears that the medical costs aren't going to come down anytime soon, and this clubbed with a lower Medicaid base, may continue to weigh on Elevance Health's performance over the coming quarters. What Does This Mean For ELV Stock? It is evident from the decline in ELV stock that the investors weren't happy with the outlook. At its current levels of around $430, ELV stock is trading at 13x its 2024 expected earnings of around $33. The 13x figure compares with the stock's average P/E ratio of 14x seen over the last three years. A slight decline in valuation multiple seems justified, given the bleak outlook for 2024 and 2025. ELV stock has underperformed the broader markets this year, with the stock down 8%, while the S&P 500 index is up 22%. Looking at a slightly longer term, the increase in ELV stock over the last three-year period has been far from consistent and has largely been as volatile as the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: What’s up with… ‘Fair share’ rules, Veon, China Mobile
URL: https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/what-s-up-with-fair-share-rules-veon-china-mobile-51570/
Time Published: 2024-10-21T15:23:30Z
Full Content:
Oct 21, 2024 In today’s industry news roundup: The Italian government puts its weight behind the case for ‘fair share’ payments from big tech in Europe; shareholder demands better returns and business progress from telco Veon; China Mobile’s numbers keep on growing; and much more! The Italian government is pressing for the introduction of so-called ‘fair share’ payments by big tech players to telecom network operators, a minister told the media in Milan on Monday. Asked about the potential of major streaming companies and cloud players contributing to telco capital expenditure (capex) budgets, Italy’s industry minister, Adolfo Urso, told reporters that “it’s important that we go in this direction,” reported Reuters. “It makes good sense for big tech to contribute to the workload that is then entrusted to the large telecommunications networks,” Urso reportedly added. National operator Telecom Italia (TIM) is one of the major European telcos urging the European Commission (EC) to introduce rules that would force large traffic generators (LTGs), the companies that produce large volumes of data and video traffic that run across telco networks such as Amazon, Google, Meta and Netflix, to contribute towards the costs of infrastructure upgrades and rollouts. The topic has been bubbling away for the past couple of years and was brought back into the limelight in September when a new report, The future of European competitiveness, recommended that the EC should introduce a slew of new rules, including pro-market consolidation policies and the introduction of fair share financial contributions from the big tech firms to telcos – see EC report proposes ‘fair share’ payments, easier telco M&A. Having wiped the sweat from its corporate brow after finally filing its 2023 annual report with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and receiving confirmation from the Nasdaq Stock Market that it is now compliant with the exchange’s listing requirements, the management team at international network operator Veon has come under pressure from an activist investor that is demanding changes in the way the company is run. Veon, which has about 160 million customers in six markets, including Ukraine (Kyivstar), Bangladesh (Banglalink) and Pakistan (Jazz), reported revenues of almost $2bn and an operating profit of $546m for the first six months of this year: It currently has a market value of just over $2.2bn. But Shah Capital, which holds a 7% stake in the operator, is “disappointed” in the company’s performance, its low valuation and its perceived lack of respect from the investment community. In a letter to the Veon board, which was shared with the media, Himanshu Shah, founder of Shah Capital, noted that Veon has a low profile amongst the investment community, is not regarded as a fintech or datacentre player (despite having activities in both sectors), has a relatively weak management team and has failed to deliver dividends or other returns to investors, such as share buybacks, in the past three years. So he wants changes and has laid out seven demands of the Veon team, including immediate and ongoing share buybacks, a local/regional IPO for Jazz, Veon’s operation in Pakistan (or a listing of its fintech unit JazzCash), the listing of Kyivstar on the Nasdaq, a greater profile for Veon in investment circles, a new governance model and a concerted effort to reduce Veon’s tax payments. According to Shah, Veon’s stock has underperformed by 80% over the past decade while the Nasdaq has risen by 400% and he believes his plans will help boost the operator’s investment profile and help to grow the company. Veon’s share price gained 2% in early Monday trading to $30.07 so there appears to be an expectation that Shah’s pressure will result in some changes at Veon. China Mobile ended September with 539.4 million 5G customers, more than half of its total mobile connections of 1,004 million, and 314 million fixed broadband customers, the operator noted in its third-quarter earnings report. For the first nine months of 2024, it generated total revenues of 791.5bn Chinese yuan ($111.2bn), of which 678bn yuan ($95.3bn) was service revenues, with both metrics up by 2% year on year. Profits before tax were up by 3.4% to 142.5bn yuan ($20bn) for the nine-month period. Rakuten Mobile’s customer base has hit the 8 million mark as the Japanese greenfield network operator continues to slowly but surely attract customers to its network. But it still has a long way to go before it starts to trouble the market leaders. Its 8 million total includes business continuity lines used as backup by enterprise customers: Excluding those connections, and those delivered by virtual network operators that offer their services over its network, Rakuten Mobile has 7.29 million customers signed up to its own services. The company is hoping to reach a total of 10 million mobile connections by the end of 2024, but even then it would still only command a single-digit market share: By contrast, Japan’s market leader NTT Docomo has 90 million mobile connections. – The staff, TelecomTV Oct 25, 2024 Oct 24, 2024 Oct 24, 2024 Oct 24, 2024 Oct 24, 2024 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Title: Best Stocks To Buy If Trump Or Harris Wins In 2024
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdaugherty/2024/10/21/best-stocks-to-buy-if-trump-or-harris-wins-in-2024/
Time Published: 2024-10-21T14:55:54Z

As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, investors are closely watching how the political landscape might impact their portfolios. Whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris emerges victorious, certain sectors and stocks are likely to benefit. Here's a look at some of the best investment opportunities for each potential outcome. If Trump Wins Energy Stocks. Trump's presidency was marked by deregulation in the energy sector, particularly for fossil fuels. Companies like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) could see significant gains under a second Trump term. Additionally, keep an eye on smaller, more agile players in the shale industry, such as Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD). Defense Contractors. Trump's emphasis on military spending could benefit major defense contractors. Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) are worth considering. Financial Services. Trump's administration was known for rolling back financial regulations. Banks and financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) might see reduced regulatory burdens and increased profitability. Infrastructure. Trump has consistently pushed for infrastructure development. Companies involved in construction and materials, such as Caterpillar (CAT) and Vulcan Materials (VMC), could benefit from increased government spending in this area. Pharmaceutical Companies. Trump's policies have generally been favorable to the pharmaceutical industry. Companies like Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) might see continued support and less pressure on drug pricing. If Harris Wins Clean Energy and Electric Vehicles. Harris's focus on combating climate change could further boost the already growing clean energy sector. Consider companies like First Solar (FSLR), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Tesla (TSLA). Infrastructure with a Green Focus. While both candidates support infrastructure spending, Harris's plan emphasizes green initiatives. Look at companies that blend traditional infrastructure with sustainability, such as Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) and Eaton Corporation (ETN). Healthcare Services. Harris's plans to expand the Affordable Care Act could benefit health insurers and hospital operators. UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Cigna (CI), and HCA Healthcare (HCA) are worth watching. Cannabis Industry. Harris has indicated support for federal decriminalization of marijuana. This could be a boon for cannabis companies like Canopy Growth (CGC) and Tilray (TLRY), though investors should be cautious of this still-volatile sector. Technology with a Focus on Cybersecurity. Harris has emphasized the need for improved national cybersecurity. Companies like CrowdStrike (CRWD), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), and Fortinet (FTNT) could see increased demand. Stocks That Could Perform Well Regardless of the Outcome The First Investment to Consider: IWM iShares Russell 2000 ETF (iShares Russell 2000 ETF). Small cap stocks historically rally significantly between election and the inauguration. This exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracks the Russell 2000 Index, representing the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity market. By including IWM in your portfolio, you're gaining broad exposure to a significant segment of the U.S. market, which can help buffer against policy-specific impacts on individual sectors or companies. Big Tech. Despite facing scrutiny from both parties, tech giants like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) have shown resilience and continue to dominate their respective markets. Consumer Staples. Companies producing essential goods tend to perform steadily regardless of political climates. Consider stocks like Procter & Gamble (PG), Coca-Cola (KO), and Walmart (WMT). Healthcare Innovation. The healthcare sector, particularly companies focused on innovation and biotechnology, may thrive under either administration. Look at firms like Moderna (MRNA) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN). Investment Strategies to Consider Diversification: Regardless of the election outcome, maintaining a diversified portfolio is crucial. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, even if you're confident in a particular election result. Long-term Perspective: While elections can cause short-term market volatility, historically, the market has trended upward over the long term regardless of which party is in power. Sector ETFs: For those preferring a broader approach, consider sector-specific ETFs aligned with the potential winner's policies. This strategy can provide exposure to benefiting sectors while mitigating single-stock risk. Dollar-Cost Averaging: Given the potential for market volatility around the election, implementing a dollar-cost averaging strategy can help mitigate timing risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of policy proposals and their potential impacts on various sectors. Be prepared to adjust your strategy as the political landscape evolves. While the outcome of the 2024 presidential election will undoubtedly impact the stock market, it's important to remember that other factors, such as global economic conditions, technological advancements, and unforeseen events, also play crucial roles in stock performance. As always, consult with a financial advisor to align your investment strategy with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance.

Title: Baird raises American Express stock target, keeps underperform
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/baird-raises-american-express-stock-target-keeps-underperform-93CH-3673260
Time Published: 2024-10-21T14:29:27Z
Full Content:
On Monday, Baird, a financial services firm, adjusted its stock price target for American Express (NYSE:AXP), increasing it to $240 from the previous $215. Despite this change, the firm maintained its Underperform rating on the credit card company's stock. The adjustment follows American Express's recent earnings report, which revealed a mix of financial results. American Express reported earnings per share (EPS) and pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) that surpassed expectations, attributed primarily to effective expense management. This positive performance was somewhat dampened by lighter revenue growth and a less certain future outlook. The company observed a slowdown in billed business trends, which could impact future revenues. The analyst from Baird noted that the stock's decline on Monday was likely due to the high expectations set before the earnings announcement combined with the slightly disappointing revenue forecast. Despite the challenges, the analyst believes that American Express's long-term earnings potential remains stable, even in the face of uncertain economic conditions. Baird acknowledged the company's strong execution in managing expenses but expressed concerns about the overall attractiveness of the stock's risk/reward profile. The firm's stance reflects a cautious view on American Express's valuation after considering both the recent underperformance and the updated financial metrics. Investors and market watchers will likely continue to monitor American Express's financial performance and market position, especially in light of the evolving economic landscape and consumer spending patterns. The updated price target from Baird provides a new benchmark for evaluating the company's stock performance in the near term. In other recent news, American Express has been in the spotlight for various reasons. The company reported strong financial results for the third quarter of 2024, with earnings per share reaching $3.49 and revenues totaling $16.6 billion, indicating an 8% increase year-over-year. Moreover, American Express raised its full-year EPS guidance to between $13.75 and $14.05. On the other hand, BTIG reiterated its Sell rating on American Express, maintaining a $230.00 price target for the company's shares. The firm's analyst raised concerns about the company's ability to achieve its 10% year-over-year revenue growth target and referred to it as "aspirational." In a significant business transaction, UBS divested its 50% stake in Swisscard to American Express. This move marked a major shift in Swisscard's ownership and was part of UBS's strategy to reshape its business following the acquisition of Credit Suisse assets. These are recent developments that highlight the dynamic changes within the financial industry. The transactions between UBS and American Express, the strong financial performance of American Express, and the cautious outlook from BTIG analysts provide a snapshot of the ongoing shifts within the sector. To complement Baird's analysis of American Express (NYSE:AXP), recent data from InvestingPro offers additional context. Despite Baird's Underperform rating, AXP's financial metrics paint a picture of a company with strong fundamentals. The company's P/E ratio of 20.39 and PEG ratio of 0.73 suggest that the stock may be undervalued relative to its growth potential, aligning with an InvestingPro Tip that AXP is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth. American Express's revenue growth of 8.94% over the last twelve months and 8.0% in the most recent quarter demonstrates the company's ability to expand its business, even as Baird notes concerns about billed business trends. Additionally, AXP's strong profitability is evident in its gross profit margin of 55.7% and operating income margin of 20.59%. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that American Express has maintained dividend payments for 54 consecutive years, showcasing its financial stability and commitment to shareholder returns. This is further supported by a dividend yield of 1.01% and a notable dividend growth of 16.67% over the last twelve months. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for American Express, providing deeper insights into the company's financial health and market position.

Title: The pill form of Ozempic could help reduce the risk of heart attacks, study says
URL: https://qz.com/semaglutide-rybelsus-heart-risks-1851677298
Time Published: 2024-10-21T14:26:58Z
Full Content:
The pill version of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-1.56%) blockbuster drug Ozempic was found to cut the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular events in a late-stage clinical trial. The Danish pharma giant announced Monday that the oral form of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, was shown to reduce the risk of major adverse heart events by 14% among people with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and/or chronic kidney disease, compared with patients who were given a placebo. Oral semaglutide is branded as Rybelsus in the United States and is currently approved for treating Type 2 diabetes. The company’s Phase 3 “SOUL” trial had nearly 10,000 patients enrolled and assessed the effect of oral semaglutide on heart health outcomes over three years. “We are pleased to see that the results from SOUL demonstrate that oral semaglutide reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and that the benefits of oral semaglutide come on top of standard of care,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president of development at Novo Nordisk, in a press release. “Approximately one in three adults with type 2 diabetes also have cardiovascular disease; therefore, it is crucial to have therapies that can address both conditions.” Novo Nordisk said it plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to expand the approved use of Rybelsus to include reducing the risk of adverse heart events. The news comes as both Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY-1.32%) are working to get more approved uses of their GLP-1 treatments beyond diabetes and weight loss. These additional approvals make it easier for health insurers to cover the medications. GLP-1s are a popular class of diabetes and obesity medications that mimic a hormone that regulates blood sugar and reduces appetite. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the producer of Mounjaro and Zepbound (both GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight loss), into the largest pharma companies in the world. In March, the FDA expanded the approved use of Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, months after the company announced results from a clinical trial that found the drug cut the risk of serious heart events by 20%. This opened the path for the weight loss drug to get coverage from Medicare. Earlier this year, Eli Lilly announced results from clinical trials that found tirzepatide, the drug behind Mounjaro and Zepbound, helped with sleep apnea and heart failure.

Title: Dear CTO: it's not 2015 anymore
URL: https://blog.godfreyai.com/p/dear-cto-its-not-2015-anymore
Time Published: 2024-10-21T14:00:54Z
Full Content:
Engineers have been spoiled rotten for the last two decades. It’s the harsh - but objective - truth. Pre-2022, twenty-somethings regularly landed 6-figure jobs with nothing but a boot camp on their resumes. Big Tech employers offered unlimited PTO, ‘20% time’, and lavish benefits - ex: private gyms, gourmet cafeterias, and on-campus childcare. Job security was a given; recruiters constantly swarmed engineers with offers of more: better benefits, bigger salaries, and higher titles. If you were lucky enough to be considered tech talent, there was virtually no way to fail. You could get fired for your own incompetence and find a new role within weeks - with a better title and salary to boot. There was an ulterior motive behind all this. Engineers fueled the software boom. It was an advantage for Google to hoard 60,000 ICs. The point was not to put them all to work, but just to have them; it bought optionality while keeping critical resourcing away from their competitors. The downstream effect of this would transform engineering as a function. If you (like most companies) couldn’t afford the $350k price tag of a senior dev, you only had one option to attract top talent: Build a ‘great engineering culture’ In other words, a culture where engineers don’t need to do anything that they don’t want to do. Engineers don’t like politics, so product management transforms into a glorified mouthpiece, running interference and smoothing things over with unhappy stakeholders. Dev time is precious, so bureaucracy is put in place to ensure that requests are screened before engineers ever need to lift a finger. Developer sentiment surveys are distributed regularly to make sure that the tech team knows their feelings very, very important. No other function is run this way, but it’s business as usual for engineering. It was for good reason - retention was critically important; losing your ICs (who were constantly solicited by Big Tech recruiters offering them bigger and better) meant you might not be able to keep the lights on. Two decades of this arms race has birthed an extraordinary phenomenon: we have an entire generation of engineering leaders who think that hiring and retention is the point. They coddle rather than manage, disdain and avoid corporate politics, and fail to prioritize the bottom line. This isn’t universally true of all engineering leaders, but these norms pervade engineering culture. Engineering has operated under unique circumstances for so long that most CTOs have never experienced a ‘normal’ business environment. They think priorities can be set on trust and good faith. They mistake developer experience metrics for ‘productivity’ indicators. They think that the product team sharing a roadmap should be enough to explain what engineering is working on. They’ve been so hyper-focused on retaining their teams and staying alive that they’ve never had to justify their existence. But these leaders don’t realize that the days of focusing on retention are over. Software ate the world, and there’s no longer a point for Google to hoard 60,000 engineers. In 2023, Big Tech unceremoniously laid off 250,000+ workers and slashed benefits left and right. The promise of AI put the nail on the coffin: the party is over, and it’s not coming back. This transition is gearing up to be a painful one for CTOs and their teams. Their C-Suite peers are looking at the massive cuts organizations like Google and Amazon were able to successfully make and wondering if they could do the same. This wouldn’t be a problem in any other function; you don’t read about JetBlue making cuts to their marketing budget and immediately wonder if you could also cut your ad spend. But engineering has a unique problem because no one really knows what engineers actually do all day. I'm including this in a pull quote to re-emphasize how weird this is: most leaders have little to no visibility into one of their business's most expensive and important core functions. There are a couple of compounding factors that got us to this point. To start, engineering just isn’t widely understood as a function. In business school, you learn about product positioning and operations, but nothing about maintaining InfoSec as strategic infrastructure. There’s just no good way for non-technical leaders to build even a basic mental model of how enterprise engineering works. This makes conversations between technical and non-technical leaders uniquely painful. Virtually every conversation requires explaining foundational principles. Imagine if the CMO, before, during, and after a proposal on a routine ad campaign, needed to explain the concept of brand, why demand generation is important, and why we run ads. It’s so bad that most engineering leaders quietly handle routine engineering tasks behind the scenes. It’s much easier to just get their team through a major update than explain [common example of maintenance that non-tech person is likely to have never heard of]. This creates an us vs. them schism between engineering and virtually every other part of the business. Engineering feels (rightly) that they aren’t understood and appreciated. The rest of the business feels (rightly) that they’re dealing with a withholding, black box. Their conversations become increasingly hostile, to the point where engineering leaders - who were often raised in environments where it was perfectly okay to avoid things they didn’t like - stop trying to explain themselves at all. In many orgs, it’s product management that ends up picking up the slack. They act as a soothing balm - building bridges on engineering’s behalf and helping explain the what, why, and how behind engineering decisions. It’s no wonder that, when someone asks what engineering is doing, the answer is usually the product roadmap. This has become the norm for many companies. And this is why it’s going to hurt like hell for engineering leaders as they navigate this era of streamlining: Engineering leaders have never had control over their own narrative. Owning your narrative is essential to playing politics. Good narratives make goals feel natural and inevitable. They help leaders get everyone - not just those they manage - excited about achieving them. They provide air cover when things get tough and kudos when things go right. Engineering teams don’t have this. At best, they have a roadmap—a literal wishlist of things that product management would like them to do. This is why most CEOs have no concept of the life-preserving maintenance activities their engineering teams do every day. They don’t know when refactors happen and why. They don’t understand when bottlenecks occur because they don’t know where critical institutional knowledge is held. In short, they can’t see the work that engineers do. Engineering feels like an expensive, entitled black box that magically delivers features. This would be bad on its own, but nature abhors a vacuum. Engineering isn’t in the driver’s seat, but it still has a narrative. Engineers are socially inept nerds. Their work is cold, sterile, and binary. They don’t understand business and have no place in the boardroom. We can’t put them in front of investors and customers. They play foosball and drink beer all day. This is how people have come to see engineers. Imagine a head of support (who brings home $120k a year after two decades of leading call centers), watching a bunch of twenty-somethings play ping-pong at 4 p.m. Engineers might have been needed, but they were only barely tolerated. This is why FAANG making cuts has been such a galvanizing force for completely unrelated companies to begin layoffs of their own. People just can’t wait to believe that engineers aren’t so damn precious anymore. Enter the fierce debates we now see on ‘developer productivity’; they’re chomping at the bit to rightsize their engineering teams. This is the existential threat that CTOs now face. The scary thing is that most of them don’t even realize it - they’re still operating like it’s 2015, where the goal is hiring and retention. They’re strolling into conversations with their CFOs on ‘productivity’ with developer sentiment surveys in hand. Their teams are sitting ducks. It’s painful to watch. The irony of it all is that most engineering organizations outside of big-tech are already lean. Tech talent has been so expensive that most leaders outside of FAANG have learned to do a lot with very little. When over-eager business stakeholders make misguided cuts, they inadvertently put business continuity at risk by cutting core infrastructure. This infrastructure - and the developers who built it - enabled the prosperity of the software boom. Software engineers might have enjoyed extraordinary privilege along the way, but it was for a job well done. Take a look at Big Tech’s stock performance over the last two decades; you could easily argue that these workers deserved even more. Other functions would do well to bring the same kind of focus on enabling productivity, happiness, and autonomy to their workers. In fact, CTOs-turned-CEOs I know tend to be some of the most kind, creative, and abundance-minded leaders I’ve ever had the pleasure to work with. They have an inherent understanding on the importance of culture and making people feel valued. But they - and their teams - won’t survive if they keep their heads in the sand. Just in this article, I probably made you feel all sorts of emotions about engineers. I did nothing to change your lived experiences; I just organized my thoughts, chose words carefully, and added necessary context. That’s the power of narrative. Good ones ring as truth because they help explain and reinforce our own experiences. That’s why it’s so important for engineering leaders to acknowledge that times have changed. If they don’t, it’s not just their teams and careers at stake - but the very continuity of the businesses they worked so hard to build. Are engineers a bunch of spoiled, overpaid geeks who were long overdue for a reckoning? Or are they the core infrastructure of revenue & innovation that we could all learn from? Whether or not CTOs choose to step up will make all the difference. After all, if you won’t write your story, someone else will. Godfrey helps CTO write their stories and bring people together. It tells the full story of what engineering teams do every day by visualizing maintenance, resourcing, and architecture in an easy, intuitive way. It’s Learn More A huge thank you to Matthew Casey, Sofia Hou, Mike Morreale, and Evan Kozliner for reading and proofing versions of this. I agree with a lot of what your article mentions. It does seem though that you think that the entire engineering population are just a bunch of spoiled overpaid 20 years-old with no developed communication skills since they didn't "need it". If this is the core point you are making then I am not sure if you are better than the average engineer that seems to think that everyone is stupid and not doing enough. While I agree that "creating a culture" was top-of-mind for CTO's in the "fatty years", I think there is a very important point that is not mentioned here. Hiring is a way of gaining power within an org. It is the prime and proven way to do exactly the "politics" the CTOs apparently "weren't doing enough of". What if we flip the idea here to "instead of trying to obtain influence and inflate headcount, CTOs should focus on building product and delivering value"? The "can you just use NORMAL WORDS" comment is a strange aside, and showing the person who wrote it in a very negative light. I know plenty of engineers who can use "normal worlds" alright, should anyone bother to actually listen. But the trend of the "fatty" years would be to prevent engineers from speaking to anyone because there was a thick (and thickening) layer of management which was laser-focused on usurping access to stakeholders. Personally, I think "the big shrink" will likely do very well by CTOs who can get back into the building mindset and the experienced engineers who will suddenly find themselves in a position where there is no insulating layer of middle management between them and the C-suite. Time will tell. No posts Ready for more?

About one year ago, a dividend investor shared his success story on /Dividends, a Reddit community of income investors with 600,000 members. The investor said he was 34, served in the air force for 12 years and worked as a defense contractor for four years.

Worked out well, because my defense contractor job was amazing ... but with the drawdown we all got laid off this year." The investor, who titled his post “bye-bye work," said he got an 80% VA disability rating, owns several rental income properties and decided to retire early. According to a screenshot of the portfolio the Redditor shared, his portfolio’s total dividend yield was around 4.52%. The investor said his total portfolio worth was $700,000, including non-dividend stocks. He estimated the total worth of his dividend portfolio to be "600’ish." Doing the math based on this dividend yield, the dividend portfolio’s total value is over $620,000. See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? The investor was repeatedly asked how he achieved this major milestone at the young age of 34. He explained that he had several real estate properties and lived frugally to save up. Answering another question about his achievement, the investor said: "I feel very blessed. I lived very frugally to get here and had quite a bit of luck for real estate timing," he said. Throughout the discussion, the investor emphasized the importance of financial discipline: "I came from poverty and only have a high school diploma. While I served, my favorite thing to do was help other military members appreciate the beauty of financial independence, instead of buying expensive cars at a young age. Putting numbers behind the advice always seems to be that light bulb moment for people." Trending: Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today. However, it's important to note that he won't be relying entirely on this $2,400-a-month dividend income during his retirement. He said, "most of my money" is in real estate. "I’m already making 25k tax-free from VA disability and 83k pretax from rental income," he added. Let's take a deeper look at the biggest holdings of the investor by examining his dividend portfolio details. Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF Shares (VTI) was among the top holdings of the investor. VTI tracks the total stock market, exposing investors to small-, mid- and large-cap stocks. About 69% of the fund is allocated to large-cap stocks. Its portfolio includes more than 3,600 stocks. Among the top holdings of the ETF are Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Amazon. In the comments section of the discussion, someone asked the Redditor for advice. Here's what he said: "Depends on your age. You can’t go wrong with just doing VTI honestly." Vanguard S&P 500 ETF Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) is another broader market ETF that was part of the investor's portfolio earning $2,400 monthly. However, the investor said his cash-secured put (CSP) option on VOO "didn't turn out as planned." That likely means the investor sold PUT options on VOO, hoping the fund's stock price would stay above the strike price until the option expired. However, the stock price may have fallen below the strike price before the option expired. VOO tracks the S&P 500 index and yields about 1.2%. It pays quarterly dividends. Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF Someone asked the Redditor making $2,400 per month in dividends about his biggest positions. He named SCHD among his top picks. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE:SCHD) tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and gives exposure to some of the top dividend stocks trading in the U.S., including Home Depot, Coca-Cola, Verizon, Lockheed Martin, Pepsi and AbbVie, among many others. Since SCHD's holdings are mostly conservative dividend payers, it's suitable for investors close to retirement looking for consistent dividend income. Realty Income With a 5% dividend yield and 30 years of consecutive dividend increases, Realty Income Corp (NYSE:O) has become a top dividend pick for many investors, especially after the first rate cut. Last month, Scotiabank increased its price target on Realty Income Corp (NYSE:O) to $64 from $61 and maintained its Sector Perform rating. JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSE:JEPI) was a key part of the Redditor's portfolio, earning about $2,400 in monthly dividends. JEPI makes money by investing in large-cap U.S. stocks and selling call options. It is ideal for those looking for exposure to defensive stocks. Altria Group Altria Group Inc. (NYSE:MO) was among the top high-yield dividend stocks in the investor’s portfolio, contributing to the $2,400 a month income. The stock yields over 8% and has gained about 20% this year. Arbor Realty Trust The Redditor said he had a "small amount" of Arbor Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:ABR) shares in his portfolio. Arbor Realty Trust is a mortgage REIT with a dividend yield of over 11%. WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund (NYSE:USFR) invests in U.S. treasuries with floating rates. The fund yields about 5% and pays monthly dividends.

Title: Stock market today: Dow slips as S&P 500, Nasdaq wobble with flood of earnings ahead

Stocks wobbled on Monday as investors braced for a packed week of top-tier earnings that could drive or drag on a record-setting rally. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped almost 0.1%, coming off a fresh all-time closing high and a sixth weekly win in a row. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged almost 0.2% lower, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) hovered near the flatline as shares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) hovered near new highs. Whether records keep rolling in rides in large part on corporate results in the coming days. Earnings season ramps up this week, as over 100 S&P 500 companies are lined up to report. So far, 80% of third quarter updates from those on the benchmark have topped the mark. Investors are on edge for Tesla's (TSLA) report on Wednesday, after its robotaxi unveiling fell short of expectations. The EV maker is the highlight of the week amid questions about Big Tech performance, even after Netflix's (NFLX) strong kickoff to the megacap season. General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola (KO), American Airlines (AAL), and UPS (UPS) are among several other big hitters on the earnings docket this week. Boeing (BA) faces a double-whammy on Wednesday, when it's expected to release earnings at the same time workers vote on whether to accept a tentative deal agreed with the union to end a five-week strike. Shares of the plane maker rose over 3% in early Monday trading. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) climbed over 6 basis points to 4.136%, the highest level since the end of July. Oil prices rose as much as 2% alongside gains for Chinese stocks (000300.SS) as China's stimulus push continued with a cut to key lending rates. Global benchmark Brent futures (BZ=F) traded near $74 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) crude futures topped $70, with Israel's next Iran move also in focus. Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more than 1.5% on Monday, helping mitigate a bigger decline in the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC). Shares of the AI chip heavy weight rose to hover above $140 each, briefly touching an intraday high of $141. The Nasdaq was trading near the flatline as Nvidia rose. The major averages opened slightly lower on Monday as investors await a fresh batch of earnings this weeek. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped roughly 0.2%, coming off a fresh all-time closing high while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged 0.1% lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) shed 0.2%. A fresh batch of quarterly results will roll in this week including Tesla (TSLA) on Wednesday, General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola (KO), American Airlines (AAL), and UPS (UPS) are among several other big names on the earnings docket this week. Boeing stock jumped as much as 4.5% Monday premarket on news that the aircraft manufacturer has reached a tentative labor deal with workers who've been on strike for more than one month. The contract would raise pay 35% over four years and increase Boeing's 401(k) contributions, but it would not reinstate pension plans — a major union demand. Analysts estimate the contract could lead to an additional $1 billion in wage-related expenses for the company. The union will vote on the contract Wednesday, the same day Boeing reports its quarterly earnings. Analysts expect the company to report an earnings loss per share of $1.50, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Boeing this year has struggled since an airplane part ripped off one of its 737 Max 9 planes during a flight in January. Shares are down over 40% this year. Of the Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, some 19 recommend buying the stock, while 11 have a Hold rating and three say to sell shares. On average, analysts see Boeing shares rising to about $192 over the next 12 months, implying a more than 20% gain.

Title: I'm a pharmacist. Knockoff Ozempic and other weight loss products have serious hidden risks
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-wegovy-zepbound-weight-loss-drags-safety-1851677271
Time Published: 2024-10-21T13:55:00Z
Full Content:
In just a few years, brand-name injectable drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound have rocketed to fame as billion-dollar annual sellers for weight loss as well as to control blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. But the price of these injections is steep: They cost about $800-$1,000 per month, and if used for weight loss alone, they are not covered by most insurance policies. Both drugs mimic the naturally occurring hormone GLP-1 to help regulate blood sugar and reduce cravings. They can be taken only with a prescription. The Food and Drug Administration announced an official shortage of the active ingredients in these drugs in 2022, but on Oct. 2, 2024, the agency announced that the shortage has been resolved for the medicine tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro (LLY-1.32%) and Zepbound. Despite the soaring demand and limited supply of these drugs, there are no generic versions available. This is because the patents for semaglutide – the active ingredient in Ozempic (NVO-1.56%) and Wegovy, which is still in shortage – and tirzepatide don’t expire until 2033 and 2036, respectively. As a result, nonbrand alternatives that can be purchased with or without a prescription are flooding the market. Yet these products come with real risks to consumers. I am a pharmacist who studies weaknesses in federal oversight of prescription and over-the-counter drugs and dietary supplements in the U.S. My research group recently has investigated loopholes that are allowing alternative weight loss products to enter the market. The dietary supplement market has sought to cash in on the GLP-1 demand with pills, teas, extracts and all manner of other products that claim to produce similar effects as the brand names at a much lower price. Products containing the herb berberine offer only a few pounds of weight loss, while many dietary supplement weight loss products contain stimulants such as sibutramine and laxatives such as phenolphthalein, which increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer. Poison control centers have seen a steep rise in calls related to off-brand weight loss medications. Unlike the dietary supplements that are masquerading as GLP-1 weight loss products, compounding pharmacies can create custom versions of products that contain the same active ingredients as the real thing for patients who cannot use either brand or generic products for some reason. These pharmacies can also produce alternative versions of brand-name drugs when official drug shortages exist. Since the demand for GLP-1 medications has far outpaced the supply, compounding pharmacies are legally producing a variety of different semaglutide and tirzepatide products. These products may come in versions that differ from the brand-name companies, such as vials of powder that must be dissolved in liquid, or as tablets or nasal sprays. Just like the brand-name drugs, you must have a valid prescription to receive them. The prices range from $250-$400 a month – still a steep price for many consumers. Compounding pharmacies must adhere to the FDA’s sterility and quality production methods, but these rules are not as rigorous for compounding pharmacies as those for commercial manufacturers of generic drugs. In addition, the products compounding pharmacies create do not have to be tested in humans for safety or effectiveness like brand-name products do. Proper dosing can also be challenging with compounded forms of the drugs. For people who cannot afford a compounding pharmacy product, or cannot get a valid prescription for semaglutide or tirzepatide, opportunistic companies are stepping in to fill the void. These include “peptide companies,” manufacturers that create non-FDA approved knockoff versions of the drugs. From November 2023 to March 2024, my team carried out a study to assess which of these peptide companies are selling semaglutide or tirzepatide products. We scoured the internet looking for these peptide companies and collected information about what they were selling and their sales practices. We found that peptide sellers use a loophole to sell these drugs. On their websites, the companies state that their drugs are for “research purposes only” or “not for human consumption,” but they do nothing to verify that the buyers are researchers or that the product is going to a research facility. By reading the comments sections of the company websites and the targeted ads on social media, it becomes clear that both buyers and sellers understand the charade. Unlike compounding pharmacies, these peptide sellers do not provide the supplies you need to dissolve and inject the drug, provide no instructions, and will usually not answer questions. Peptide sellers, since they allegedly are not selling to consumers, do not require a valid prescription and will sell consumers whatever quantity of drug they wish to purchase. Even if a person has an eating disorder such as anorexia nervosa, the companies will happily sell them a semaglutide or tirzepatide product without a prescription. The average prices of these peptide products range from $181-$203 per month. Peptide sellers do not have to adhere to the rules or regulations that drug manufacturers or compounding pharmacies do. Many companies state that their products are 99% pure, but an independent investigation of three companies’ products from August 2023 to March 2024 found that the purity of the products were far less than promised. One product contained endotoxin – a toxic substance produced by bacteria – suggesting that it was contaminated with microbes. In addition, the products’ promised dosages were off by up 29% to 39%. Poor purity can cause patients to experience fever, chills, nausea, skin irritation, infections and low blood pressure. In this study, some companies never even shipped the drug, telling the buyers they needed to pay an additional fee to have the product clear customs. If a consumer is harmed by a poor-quality product, it would be difficult to sue the seller, since the products specifically say they are “not for human consumption.” Ultimately, consumers are being led to spend money on products that may never arrive, could cause an infection, might not have the correct dose, and contain no instructions on how to safely use or store the product. To combat these alternative sellers, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly began offering an alternative version of its brand-name Zepbound product for weight loss in September 2024. Instead of its traditional injection pen products that cost more than $1,000 for a month’s supply, this product comes in vials that patients draw up and inject themselves. For patients who take 5 milligrams of Zepbound each week, the vial products would cost them $549 a month if patients buy it through the company’s online pharmacy and can show that they do not have insurance coverage for the drug. After a grilling on Capitol Hill in September 2024, pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk came under intense pressure to offer patients without prescription coverage a lower-priced product for its brand-name Wegovy as well. In the next few years, additional brand-name GLP-1 agonist drugs will likely make it to market. As of October 2024, a handful of these products are in late-phase clinical trials, with active ingredients such as retatrutide, survodutide and ecnoglutide, and more than 18 other drug candidates are in earlier stages of development. When new pharmaceutical companies enter this market, they will have to offer patients lower prices than Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk in order to gain market share. This is the most likely medium-term solution to drive down the costs of GLP-1 drugs and eliminate the drug shortages in the marketplace. C.

Tech led US stocks slightly lower on Monday as investors braced for a packed week of top-tier earnings that could drive or drag on a record-setting rally. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped roughly 0.1%, coming off a fresh all-time closing high and a sixth weekly win in a row. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged almost 0.1% lower, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) shed 0.1%. The 10-year treasury yield (^TNX) climbed to the highest level since the end of July. Whether records keep rolling in rides in large part on corporate results in the coming days. Earnings season ramps up this week, as over 100 S&P 500 companies are lined up to report. So far, 80% of third quarter updates from those on the benchmark have topped the mark. Investors are on edge for Tesla's (TSLA) report on Wednesday, after its robotaxi unveiling fell short of expectations. The EV maker is the highlight of the week amid questions about Big Tech performance, even after Netflix's (NFLX) strong kickoff to the megacap season. General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola (KO), American Airlines (AAL), and UPS (UPS) are among several other big hitters on the earnings docket this week. Boeing (BA) faces a double-whammy on Wednesday, when it's expected to release earnings at the same time workers vote on whether to accept a tentative deal agreed with the union to end a five-week strike. Shares of the plane maker rose over 3% in early Monday trading. Meanwhile, oil prices recovered, rising nearly 2% alongside gains for Chinese stocks (000300.SS) as China's stimulus push continued with a cut to key lending rates. Global benchmark Brent futures (BZ=F) traded near $74 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) crude futures topped $70, with Israel's next Iran move also in focus. The major averages opened slightly lower on Monday as investors await a fresh batch of earnings this weeek. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped roughly 0.2%, coming off a fresh all-time closing high while the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (^DJI) edged 0.1% lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) shed 0.2%. A fresh batch of quarterly results will roll in this week including Tesla (TSLA) on Wednesday, General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola (KO), American Airlines (AAL), and UPS (UPS) are among several other big names on the earnings docket this week. Boeing stock jumped as much as 4.5% Monday premarket on news that the aircraft manufacturer has reached a tentative labor deal with workers who've been on strike for more than one month. The contract would raise pay 35% over four years and increase Boeing's 401(k) contributions, but it would not reinstate pension plans — a major union demand. Analysts estimate the contract could lead to an additional $1 billion in wage-related expenses for the company. The union will vote on the contract Wednesday, the same day Boeing reports its quarterly earnings. Analysts expect the company to report an earnings loss per share of $1.50, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Boeing this year has struggled since an airplane part ripped off one of its 737 Max 9 planes during a flight in January. Shares are down over 40% this year. Of the Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, some 19 recommend buying the stock, while 11 have a Hold rating and three say to sell shares. On average, analysts see Boeing shares rising to about $192 over the next 12 months, implying a more than 20% gain.

Title: Here’s one economic message from the Costco gold bar craze

Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. It’s all about trust. The nation may have left the gold standard behind in 1933, but Costco (COST) shoppers have proven that gold is a red-hot buy. Sure, it’s an investment, but it’s also “reflecting this yearning for real money,” economist and senior fellow at the Independent Institute Judy Shelton told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below). “Gold is kind of a surrogate for the real economy, and it represents commodities but also that traditional role of money you can trust.” The wildly popular Costco bullion was introduced to warehouse club members last year via 24-karat 1 oz bars. The product has flown off the shelves, with Costco raking in a reported $200 million per month in gold bar sales. Demand has been so great that the retailer has begun to offer platinum bars. According to Shelton, the gold rush at Costco likely has personal meaning to the financially skittish consumer. Over the past few years, consumers have become accustomed to watching inflation spike as high as 9% while the US dollar lost 20% of its purchasing power. This hasn't exactly stoked Americans' confidence. Judy Shelton will be at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference in November. Register to attend here! The sudden rise in gold’s popularity could also relate to consumers’ overall trust in the precious metal and what it represents. “It’s a meaningful unit of account. It works across borders,” she said. “It has universal value, and it’s highly recognized.” Precious metals such as gold are currently having a solid ride. Year to date, gold prices are up 31.72% to $2,750 an ounce. Silver and platinum prices are up 41% and 3%, respectively. UBS chief investment officer of the Americas, Solita Marcelli, said the gold price rally has further room to run, citing the potential for more interest rate cuts and worsening geopolitical tensions. "Despite the rally, we think gold's hedging properties remain attractive. Alongside physical gold, investors may consider exposure through structured strategies, ETFs, or via gold miner equities. Investors unaccustomed to the volatility of individual commodities may also consider exposure via an actively managed strategy that seeks to deliver alpha over comparable passive indices," Marcelli wrote in a note to clients.

Title: BofA nearly doubles AppLovin stock price target, rates a Buy amid AI-driven growth
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bofa-nearly-doubles-applovin-stock-price-target-rates-a-buy-amid-aidriven-growth-93CH-3673022
Time Published: 2024-10-21T13:09:57Z
Full Content:
On Monday, BofA Securities made a significant adjustment to its valuation of AppLovin Corp (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:APP), raising the price target to $210 from the previous $120 while retaining a Buy rating on the stock. The adjustment reflects a reassessment of the company's growth prospects following the second quarter 2023 introduction of its artificial intelligence engine, Axon 2.0. The firm's analyst believes that Axon 2.0 has sparked a transformation in AppLovin's growth and profitability that has not been fully appreciated by the market or other analysts. This underrecognition has led BofA Securities to reclassify AppLovin as a growth stock. The firm has increased its valuation to 18 times enterprise value (EV) on the calendar year 2026 (CY26) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) from 14 times CY25 EBITDA. In addition to the revaluation, BofA Securities has also increased its estimates for the company's software topline growth for calendar years 2025 and 2026 by 600 basis points and 300 basis points, respectively. This revision is based on growing confidence in AppLovin's core business, particularly in mobile game advertisements. The firm's model for the Software Segment EBITDA now extends through calendar year 2028, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30%. The analyst highlighted that few stocks demonstrate approximately 90% incremental EBITDA margins, which justifies a significant change in valuation. Even with the raised target, BofA Securities' valuation of AppLovin remains conservative compared to the valuations of AppLovin's marketing technology peers such as The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), and Snap Inc . (NYSE:SNAP), which trade at 38 times, 37 times, and 18 times EBITDA, respectively. Notably, AppLovin's profitability surpasses that of these companies. BofA Securities' forecasts for AppLovin stand well above the consensus, and the firm claims to have the highest estimates on the street by a considerable margin. The analyst's outlook suggests a robust future for AppLovin, underpinned by solid fundamentals and a strong position within its industry. In other recent news, AppLovin Corp has seen a series of adjustments by financial analysts. Goldman Sachs downgraded AppLovin stock to neutral, setting a new price target of $147.00, following an upward revision of the company's Q3 revenue projections for 2024. Meanwhile, HSBC maintained a Buy rating for AppLovin, raising the stock target to $154.40, due to the company's growth momentum in the software platform sector and its expansion into online retail advertising. Macquarie also maintained its Outperform rating, increasing its price target to $150, recognizing AppLovin's significant growth and higher margins. Citi raised its price target for AppLovin to $155, maintaining a Buy rating, due to increased confidence in the company's potential for software revenue growth. On the other hand, UBS upgraded AppLovin's stock from Neutral to Buy, setting a new price target of $145, based on the company's improved visibility into medium-term revenue growth. BTIG maintained a Buy rating, raising its price target to $150, reflecting a positive view of the company's competitive position and future growth potential. Despite these positive assessments, Benchmark maintained a sell rating, raising its price target to $66, citing potential challenges. AppLovin's Q2 financial results showed strong performance, with a 44% increase in revenue to $1.08 billion. The company's future guidance predicts Q3 revenue between $1.115 billion and $1.135 billion, and adjusted EBITDA ranging from $630 million to $650 million. AppLovin's recent performance and future prospects align closely with BofA Securities' bullish outlook. According to InvestingPro data, the company's revenue growth remains strong, with a 37.31% increase over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This growth is complemented by an impressive EBITDA growth of 121.63% over the same period, supporting the analyst's view on the company's expanding profitability. InvestingPro Tips highlight that AppLovin's net income is expected to grow this year, and analysts anticipate sales growth in the current year. These projections reinforce BofA Securities' increased estimates for the company's software topline growth. Additionally, the tip indicating that AppLovin operates with a moderate level of debt suggests financial stability, which could contribute to the sustained growth trajectory outlined in the analyst's report. It's worth noting that AppLovin's stock has shown a strong return over the last year, with a price total return of 286.43% as of the latest data. This performance, coupled with the fact that the stock is trading near its 52-week high, aligns with the market's growing recognition of AppLovin's potential, as suggested by BofA Securities. Investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis can access 21 additional InvestingPro Tips for AppLovin, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

On Monday, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) released the headline results from the SOUL Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial. Last year, Novo Nordisk’s subcutaneous once-weekly (injectable) semaglutide 2.4 mg, available as Wegovy, showed a 20% reduction in MACE compared to placebo. The SOUL trial compared oral semaglutide to placebo as an adjunct to the standard of care to prevent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as cardiac arrest, stroke, heart failure, or cardiovascular death. The SOUL trial was initiated in 2019 and enrolled 9,650 people with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Also Read: Novo Nordisk’s Weight Loss Drug Ozempic Associated With Reduced Opioid, Alcohol Use Disorder Incidences, Study Shows. Oral semaglutide is administered once daily and is approved for use in three doses, 3 mg, 7 mg, and 14 mg, under the brand name Rybelsus. It is indicated for adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise. As part of the standard of care, 49% of patients received SGLT2i at some point during the trial. The trial achieved its primary objective by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior reduction in MACE of 14% for people treated with oral semaglutide compared to placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was defined as the composite outcome of the first occurrence of MACE defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. All three primary endpoint components contributed to the superior MACE reduction demonstrated by oral semaglutide. In the trial, oral semaglutide appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile in line with previous oral semaglutide trials. Novo Nordisk expects to file for regulatory approval of a label expansion for Rybelsus in the US and EU around late 2024 or early 2025. The detailed results from SOUL will be presented at a scientific conference in 2025. In 2023, Rybelsus generated global revenues of DKK18.75 billion (around $2.73 billion). Price Action: NVO stock is down 0.41% at $117.60 during the premarket session at last check Monday.

Title: Why and How Lenovo Is Outpacing the Competition in AI
URL: https://www.technewsworld.com/story/why-and-how-lenovo-is-outpacing-the-competition-in-ai-179428.html
Time Published: 2024-10-21T12:00:13Z

On paper, Lenovo Group and Dell Technologies are remarkably alike, but the two companies are organized and run differently. That will become clear to most who compare last week’s Lenovo Tech World 2024 event to Dell’s similar event next month. At the heart of the difference is the nature of both companies’ acquisitions and executive leadership. Lenovo’s leadership is geographically diverse, making it a truly global company, while Dell’s is primarily centralized in the U.S. Although Michael Dell was instrumental in the company’s growth, he appears to have almost retired in place. Meanwhile, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing, known as YY, is still a vibrant part of the company’s management. This difference allows Lenovo to move much more decisively on industry changes, while Dell appears unable to make big moves and has to undergo massive layoffs to make the same pivot to AI that Lenovo has already made. Another difference is the extent to which Lenovo is using AI. It’s already using AI operationally and selling mature AI solutions, while Dell still appears stuck on trying to sell a concept that the firm does not seem to know how to use yet. Dell’s marketing is doing a decent job of covering for these shortcomings, but the layoffs imply most customers are not fooled. Let’s discuss some of the highlights from Lenovo Tech World 2024. Then, we’ll close with my Product of the Week, an interesting, mechanized laptop that Lenovo highlighted at the event. In the opening moments of an event like this, you can often see where a company’s heart and focus are. It might do something humorous or feature the leading offering, but occasionally, I am surprised, and this was one of those times. Lenovo opened with a demonstration featuring an individual with advanced ALS who cannot speak and can only move her eyes. But Lenovo had fashioned an AI solution for her so that, using AI, she could talk again. This breakthrough is monumental for individuals with ALS, enabling both speech and online interaction. This demonstration was incredibly powerful, and Lenovo followed up by covering what it’s doing for education with AI. Education is interesting because while it enormously impacts the world, the segment is not very profitable. Personalized learning for students using AI could be a massive benefit, as it should better engage those students and significantly increase the effectiveness of education across all demographics. Automated AI quizzes coupled with classes that teach using multiple AIs to create more compelling documents and reports should far better prepare students for the AI future than any other existing curriculum. Both things told me that Lenovo is more about making a difference than making a profit, which is incredibly important when talking about a technology that could eliminate many jobs. Lenovo made it clear that it is not working on AI to replace people but as a tool that would make students, people with disabilities, and employees more valuable rather than redundant over time. This approach stands in stark contrast to Dell’s recent AI-related layoffs. One of the more interesting offerings at the event was the Lenovo AI Library. Most companies are nowhere near as advanced as Lenovo in using AI. However, Lenovo’s journey to AI has created a massive amount of information. The company has now placed it in a library that can help its customers gain the insights they need to make informed AI solutions. Too many vendors are marketing AI as if it were an end in itself, similar to how digital transformation was once promoted rather than a tool to achieve specific business goals. This should ensure that Lenovo’s customers succeed while most other efforts are still, unfortunately, incurring significant failures. Where Lenovo stands out when it comes to these efforts is the blending of multiple AIs into a solution. Like people, AIs are not all equal and are best suited for the tasks they were designed to handle. However, many projects require diverse skills, often necessitating using multiple AI systems for successful completion. Lenovo’s hybrid AI approach is unique in recognizing this, offering greater real-world benefits and a higher likelihood of success. One example of this was the Lenovo AI paralegal. My wife and I are watching the old TV show “Suits,” which does a surprisingly excellent job of pointing out the critical nature of paralegals. These people are overworked, and much of what they do requires massive amounts of research, where a mistake can make the difference between winning and losing a case. Another powerful example was using AI for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy. Qualified ABA practitioners are expensive, and only relatively wealthy children have access to this type of therapy, which is increasingly critical given how much damage social media tools like TikTok are doing to them. The use of AI in this context could tremendously reduce the growing depression and behavioral problems today’s kids are suffering. Lenovo has long had a robust partnering culture. Most OEMs are at arm’s length from their technology suppliers, and our industry is famous for vendor conflict. Lenovo collaborates surprisingly closely with its suppliers, which has paid dividends in the past with workstations. Lenovo uniquely adopted AMD’s Threadripper and almost immediately took workstation leadership. Today, Lenovo’s closeness with Nvidia is what has paid off. Lenovo showcased what is arguably the best Nvidia Blackwell solution, which is cooled with Lenovo’s 6th-generation warm-water cooling technology, Neptune. Blackwell is incredibly powerful but also uses a lot of power and generates a great deal of heat. Neptune cools the part cost-effectively, which addresses two of the shortcomings associated with a part in this class. Neptune is today’s most widely used and efficient cooling technology for data centers. Over a decade ago, Dell predicted at Dell World that robotics would become the next big thing for enterprises. Autonomous vehicles have since emerged as the leading class of autonomous robots, with other types of robots also developing. This year, Lenovo reinforced this idea by showcasing current solutions, while Dell has yet to follow through on its prediction. Working with Nvidia, Lenovo showcased a Blackwell-based drive solution for cars with 2000 TOPS (Trillions or Tera Operations per Second). High-performance AI PCs have only 40 TOPS. Dell looked at doing this over five years ago but never executed a growing problem with that company due to a lack of clear leadership and willingness to take critical risks. Lenovo also highlighted its version of the autonomous robotic dog. Other firms have advanced robotic dogs, but Lenovo is the first in its class to do this.

Occasionally, an OEM surprises me, but I’ve been disappointed by how companies like Dell have approached AI sales and deployment to date. Many are not yet using AI extensively themselves and, as a result, lack the understanding needed to drive successful implementations. Lenovo, however, isn’t just pushing AI; it’s offering complete AI solutions — from education to robotics — positioning itself and its customers for the future of AI. For me, it was the work in education that I found to be the most compelling. Technology is doing massive harm to kids now, and we need to prioritize technological solutions to address this critical problem. I found a kindred heart in Lenovo; its focus here could save many kids from uncertain futures. (Photo by Author) I typically put products you can buy in this section, but I was so impressed with this concept that I am making an exception this week. I have an expensive automotive hobby, and I often watch videos on how to do this while working on my cars. The problem is that seeing the screen as I move around the vehicle usually requires that I reposition the tablet or PC several times, but my hands are greasy and can make a mess of that hardware, not to mention that there are times when my hands are otherwise engaged. The ThinkBook Auto Twist AI PC concept looks like a regular laptop, but the screen rotates to follow you around the room. So, if you are cooking, working on a project (like a car), or otherwise moving around, the screen automatically moves to follow you. This demo video is pretty cool: One of the Amazon Alexa versions did this a few years ago, and I found it incredibly useful, but the device always had to be plugged in. Plus, Alexa’s capabilities limited it, and since Alexa isn’t a PC, it couldn’t access the videos I wanted to watch. The PC that Nvidia is secretly working on will take this concept further (and may not even need an OS like Windows), but the ThinkBook Auto Twist AI PC concept comes closer to what I think it will be than anything else I have seen. This thing is awesome, so it’s my Product of the Week. Rob Enderle has been an ECT News Network columnist since 2003.

Monday Tee Up: Here Comes Tesla The flood of earnings continues this week, while the U.S. presidential election and the next Fed rate meeting draw nearer. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was higher by 1.0%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both gained 0.8%. For the year, the DJIA is higher by 15%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have both gained 23%. The earnings calendar is packed this week, with companies reporting from a wide range of sectors. On Tuesday, General Electric, General Motors, Lockheed Martin, 3M, Philip Morris, Texas Instruments, and Verizon all report. On Wednesday, Tesla, IBM, AT&T, Coca-Cola, and Boeing. On Thursday, Honeywell, UPS, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and Northrop Grumman. And on Friday, Colgate-Palmolive. So far, 71 of the S&P 500 companies (14%) have reported. Earnings are coming in 4% higher than in the prior-year quarter. That follows a strong 13% rise in earnings for 2Q. We expect 5%-7% growth in earnings this quarter. For full year, we forecast high single-digit growth, so roughly a 7%-9% gain. For 3Q, we expect Information Technology, Communication Services, and Healthcare to be the sectors that shine. On the economic calendar, Wednesday features Existing Home Sales and the Fed Beige Book. Thursday brings New Home Sales, while Friday includes Durable Goods and Consumer Sentiment. Argus Chief Economist Chris Graja is highlighting Durable Goods orders as his 'Call of the Week.' Chris expects September Durable Goods to fall 4.5% year over year, this based on a tough year-ago comparison. Durable Goods orders, which include the huge-ticket civilian aircraft and defense categories, are probably the most volatile of the 40 or so economic indicators we forecast and will have increasing importance to our outlook in the coming months. In the 2Q GDP report, the Equipment category jumped 9.8% and added one half point to the economy's 3% growth. Equipment could be a strong performer again in 3Q based on the Atlanta Fed's GDP Nowcast. We also analyze shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircrafts, this for a less-volatile look at core trends in manufacturing. We expect more modest growth in 4Q and in 2025. Last week, Retail Sales came in higher than expected at 0.4% for September compared to expectations of 0.3%, and 0.1% the month before. Removing gas sales (which were down sharply as the price of gas declined) and car sales (which were flat), overall Retail Sales were even higher, rising 0.7%. Food remains a category on which people are spending a disproportionate amount of money. Both Food and Beverage Stores and Food Services a MKC BA TMO GLW, NEM DHR

Title: $2 trillion Norway oil fund CEO Nicolai Tangen says AI stock boom has created a concentration risk ‘we have never seen before’

The boss of Norway’s $2 trillion sovereign oil fund has fired a warning to investors who have won big on the AI stock market boom, as he cautioned that “we are heading for a period of low returns.” Nicolai Tangen, the CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, said there was a new reality in the stock market amid geopolitical tensions and falling liquidity. “The time of very low interest rates is gone. The world is a much more dangerous place,” Tangen told the Financial Times’ Unhedged podcast. The companies that have solidified their place at the top of that new reality are becoming a key risk area. Businesses that create or design AI semiconductor chips and those that use the tech for their burgeoning AI capabilities saw massive share price appreciation in the past couple of years. Tangen said leadership in the stock market was very narrow, pointing out that the top of the market now comprised “companies with some kind of AI connection,” while the top 10 companies in the U.S. S&P 500 accounted for around 20% of the index. “The concentration is absolutely worrying. It means that there is a risk in the stock market which we have never seen before.” Tangen described how the biggest players in the stock market were now heavily interlinked around the business of microchips. He cited Dutch giant ASML, “which makes the machines to make the chips,” before selling them to Taiwan. Many chips are then designed by Nvidia, before being sold to the likes of Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. “So there are very few companies tied into them, and they are getting bigger and bigger and more and more important.” Despite his warnings about concentration risk in the stock market, Tangen’s $2 trillion oil fund is heavily invested in the companies he cited as key risk areas. Norges holds a more than 1% stake in the U.S.’s biggest tech companies, including Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and Alphabet. It also holds a sizable stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Collectively, Norges owns $196 billion worth of shares in Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, TSMC, and ASML. Tangen said heavy AI regulation in Europe meant it was likely that the big tech players would continue to come from the U.S. “We have hardly any large tech companies in Europe; we are far behind. Will we manage to catch up? I would be surprised if we did. “In America, you have lots of AI and little regulation, and in Europe, you have little AI and lots of regulation.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Microsoft (MSFT+0.03%) has launched new capabilities for its “personal, private” artificial intelligence assistant, Copilot. The company announced that users can now build their own autonomous agents in Copilot Studio that can “understand the nature of your work and act on your behalf.” Microsoft customers will be able to create their own autonomous agents in public preview in November, the company announced during its AI Tour in London. AI agents range from simple prompt-and-response to being fully autonomous, meaning they can “work on behalf of an individual, team, or function” on business processes, Microsoft said. Users will be able to interact with the autonomous agents through Copilot. Read more: Inside Microsoft’s AI strategy The company also announced 10 new autonomous agents for its enterprise platform, Dynamics 365. The new agents are designed for workers in “sales, service, finance, and supply chain,” but the company plans to develop more agents, it said. The 10 autonomous agents will become available for public preview later this year and into early 2025, according to Microsoft. Microsoft said its Copilot Studio autonomous agents will use OpenAI’s new “reasoning” model, o1 — which is in preview — as well as other new AI models “to boost their AI and reasoning abilities.” “These models offer more precise predictions, enhanced natural language processing, and improved decision-making support,” Microsoft said. In July, Nvidia (NVDA+0.52%) chief executive Jensen Huang said the next wave of AI is in the enterprise, where everyone at a company “will have an AI assistant.” “We hope that we can give every single organization the ability to create their own AIs,” Huang said during a fireside chat at SIGGRAPH, a computer graphics conference. “So everybody would be augmented and have a collaborative AI that could empower them, help them do better work.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Inside Microsoft's AI strategy: Compete with everybody on everything

LOS ANGELES — At a Microsoft (MSFT) event here earlier this month, attendees sipped drinks and sampled hors d’oeuvres as Kendrick Lamar pulsed through the speakers. They meandered between rows of laptops, each demonstrating the latest capabilities of the company’s flagship AI product, Copilot. True to the city’s reputation, many of those present were influencers, filming their interactions with the technology for their followers. Yet even these arbiters of digital trends seemed genuinely intrigued. The artificial intelligence updates on display marked a significant shift from Microsoft’s previous focus on business productivity, with features that appealed to a broader audience — including tech-savvy influencers. The tech giant’s latest offerings represent a significant leap forward in personalized AI, integrating voice and vision features that promise to transform how users interact with the technology. Among the additions to Microsoft’s Copilot are a visual recognition tool, chatty conversational abilities, and a virtual news anchor. Microsoft isn’t done with Copilot announcements, with even more updates announced at a London event Monday morning. The ambitious moves position Copilot as a direct challenger to AI products made by Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Adobe (ADBE), and even OpenAI, one of the company’s partners and the maker of ChatGPT. By combining advanced language processing with visual and auditory capabilities, and envisioning how AI could help people throughout their day, Microsoft is aiming to become the go-to AI platform for both work and personal life. The Copilot revamp is the first major initiative led by Mustafa Suleyman since his appointment as CEO of Microsoft AI. Suleyman, a co-founder of DeepMind and the startup Inflection AI, joined Microsoft earlier this year when the tech giant acquired Inflection. “At Microsoft AI, we are creating an AI companion for everyone,” Suleyman wrote in a blog post. Carolina Milanesi, the president and principal analyst at Creative Strategies, went to an accompanying Copilot launch event in New York and described it as Suleyman’s coming out party. “It was the first time Microsoft talked about the consumer,” she said in an interview. Milanesi noted that some of the demos were running on iOS or Android devices, signaling Microsoft’s intent to reach users across all platforms. Milanesi said it was also the first time she thought that Microsoft could appeal to the non-business side of people’s lives beyond search and gaming. The focus on the updated Copilot app, one of the primary ways to interact with the tech, is an especially important move, given how much time people spend on their phones. By launching it for iOS and Android, Microsoft has beaten both Apple and Samsung to the punch in bringing a comprehensive AI assistant to smartphones. “Consumers are still not quite sure what the return on investment is,” Milanesi said of using phones with AI capabilities. “Having an app that delivers value to you is going to be easier to see versus when it’s embedded across the device.” The strategy gives Microsoft a window of opportunity to establish itself in the mobile AI space before Apple rolls out its Apple Intelligence or Samsung embraces solutions like Google’s Gemini. Whether Copilot will live up to other offerings, Microsoft’s strategy is clear. “Whatever they sell,” Milanesi said, “generative AI is part of it and will drive a differentiation in what they’re selling.” Not long after investing a reported $13 billion in OpenAI last year, Microsoft announced AI assistants it calls Copilots, which plug into its biggest software products including Word, Excel and PowerPoint — all powered at least in part by ChatGPT. The Copilots are meant to make work easier by doing things like generating slide decks or creating notes from a Zoom meeting. But Microsoft’s latest Copilot update reaches far beyond the workday, challenging a wide array of existing tools. Taking cues from OpenAI’s recent voice innovations in ChatGPT, Microsoft has given its AI assistant a human-like conversational ability. Users can now choose from four distinct voices and engage in natural, flowing dialogues with Copilot. The AI allows for mid-conversation interruptions and follow-up questions, mirroring the back-and-forth of chatting with a real person. Even Microsoft’s Paint app, once the lowliest of visual editing tools, now comes with generative AI abilities that compete with Adobe’s Firefly. A feature in the app called Image Creator lets users generate images from any text description. Doodlers can sketch out a basic scene and have Paint make it more elaborate and realistic, using a creativity slider to adjust the output. Updates to Microsoft’s Edge browser, which has Copilot built-in, can now summarize page contents in Bing searches, a shot across the bow at Google’s rocky foray into AI-infused search. Other updates also take on Google. Copilot Daily creates audio summaries of the news that rival NotebookLM, a Google AI product that can take text and generate a podcast in minutes. But at the heart of Copilot’s overhaul is Microsoft’s ambitious foray into visual AI: Copilot Vision. This feature gives the assistant the ability to comprehend and analyze the content of web pages in real-time, effectively allowing it to “see” alongside the user. By integrating this visual acuity with its enhanced voice capabilities, Copilot can now engage in nuanced, context-aware dialogue about on-screen content — be it text, images, or multimedia. So far, only a select number of paid subscribers have access to this service. Even with all these announcements, Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, downgraded his rating on Microsoft stock from “Buy” to “Neutral.” “Our perspective on Microsoft is still very positive,” Luria said in an interview. “They’re doing a lot to provide both enterprise and consumers with AI tools. Our recent downgrade is predicated more on the fact that we think that in many regards, Amazon (AMZN) and Google have caught up, and in some regards they’re even in the lead.” Luria said that while Microsoft is ahead of the curve for many AI offerings, AI chip development, a very time-consuming process, is a key area where Microsoft lags its rivals. Google started work on its chips over a decade ago, with Amazon following a few years later. “Microsoft was a little late to the party in realizing that they can’t just depend on Nvidia (NVDA),” Luria said, referring to the AI chipmaking behemoth. “So they’ve only had a couple of years of development into their products.” D.A. Davidson has found that while Amazon and Google have extensively deployed their own custom chips across their data centers, Microsoft has not achieved the same level of broad deployment. “They started their chip development later than Amazon and Google,” Luria said. “But apart from that, they’re doing what they need to do.” Microsoft rode the wave of AI enthusiasm in 2023, with its stock surging almost 57% last year. But 2024 has proven to be a more challenging landscape for the tech giant. Microsoft stock has risen about 12% so far this year, trailing most of its peers and even the broader S&P 500 index. While Microsoft has not yet disclosed specific revenue figures for generative AI products such as Copilot, the company has provided some insight into AI’s impact on its business. During its last quarterly earnings call in July, Microsoft said its cloud service saw 29% year-over-year revenue growth, with 8 percentage points of that growth attributable to AI services. If it becomes a seamless part of people’s lives, Microsoft’s Copilot could unlock new revenue streams and solidify the company’s position in both consumer and enterprise markets. The challenge lies in creating AI tools that are not just innovative, but indispensable to users’ daily lives and work processes. “Our task is to ensure AI always enriches people’s lives and strengthens our bonds with others, while supporting our uniqueness and endlessly complex humanity,” Suleyman wrote. “This is a new era of technology that doesn’t just ‘solve problems,’ it’s there to support you, teach you and help you.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: Oral semaglutide demonstrates a 14% reduction in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes in the SOUL trial

October 21, 2024 05:26 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 21 October 2024 — Novo Nordisk today announced the headline results from the SOUL cardiovascular outcomes trial. The double-blinded, randomised trial compared oral semaglutide to placebo as an adjunct to standard of care for the prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The trial enrolled 9,650 people with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD). As part of standard of care, 49% of patients received SGLT2i at some point during the trial. The trial achieved its primary objective by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior reduction in MACE of 14% for people treated with oral semaglutide compared to placebo1. The primary endpoint of the study was defined as the composite outcome of the first occurrence of MACE defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. All three components of the primary endpoint contributed to the superior MACE reduction demonstrated by oral semaglutide. In the trial, oral semaglutide appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile in line with previous oral semaglutide trials. "We are pleased to see that the results from SOUL demonstrate that oral semaglutide reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and that the benefits of oral semaglutide come on top of standard of care,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president and head of Development at Novo Nordisk. “Approximately one in three adults with type 2 diabetes also have cardiovascular disease; therefore, it is crucial to have therapies that can address both conditions.” Novo Nordisk expects to file for regulatory approval of a label expansion for Rybelsus® in both the US and EU around the turn of the year. The detailed results from SOUL will be presented at a scientific conference in 2025. About the SOUL trialSOUL was a multicentre, international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial with 9,650 people enrolled. It was conducted to assess the effect of oral semaglutide vs placebo on cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes and established CVD and/or CKD. The SOUL trial was initiated in 2019. The key objective of SOUL was to demonstrate that oral semaglutide lowers the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite endpoint consisting of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke) compared to placebo, both added to standard of care in patients with type 2 diabetes and established CVD and/or CKD. About Rybelsus® Oral semaglutide is administered once daily and is approved for use in three doses, 3 mg, 7 mg and 14 mg, under the brand name Rybelsus®. It is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise. In the EU, a new formulation of 1.5 mg, 4 mg and 9 mg doses of Rybelsus® are approved and are bioequivalent to the original formulation of Rybelsus®. 1Based on treatment policy estimand: treatment effect regardless of treatment adherence Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark. Our purpose is to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases, built upon our heritage in diabetes. We do so by pioneering scientific breakthroughs, expanding access to our medicines, and working to prevent and ultimately cure disease.

We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI news investors should not miss. According to Ark Invest, an investment manager focused on disruptive technologies, artificial intelligence breakthroughs are expected to increase the share of the global equity market associated with disruptive innovation from 16% to 60% by 2030. With inflation transitioning to deflation in several sectors, the firm believes that five innovation platforms, namely robotics, energy storage, AI, blockchain, and multi-OMIC (biological analysis) sequencing will be profoundly impacting macroeconomic metrics over the next few years. “Interest rates are likely to surprise on the low side of expectations, broadening the equity rally from a narrow subset of stocks and reinforcing the need for diversified AI investments.” -Catherine Wood, CEO and CIO Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. One of the firm's ETFs with the investment theme of next-generation internet outperformed broad-based global equity indices in the third quarter, benefiting from its holdings in companies involved in innovative technologies. The year-to-date performance of the fund is 16.81%, outperforming its category by 1.59 percentage points year-to-date. In light of this trend, joining CNBC’s “The Exchange”, technology reporter Kate Rooney revealed how Wall Street is trying to cash in on the AI craze using AI itself. According to Rooney, the new world of generative AI is starting an “arms race for hedge funds”. Modern versions of AI today are better than human traders in ways more than one. They learn from mistakes and get smarter along the way, and they ultimately require minimal human intervention. Combining this with the rise of OpenAI and Anthropic, these “off-the-shelf” models tend to be cheaper. Moreover, while human traders may be capable, they often succumb to emotions and tend to make mistakes. This is why Intelligent Alpha CEO Doug Clinton believes that a “lack of emotion” is actually the edge or “superpower” of AI. That said, the program revealed how hedge funds are now looking into AI to “get ahead of the markets”, where their use of AI will ultimately help them improve decision-making in the field. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, which have raised significant capital along the way, ultimately need enterprise clients to scale, and Wall Street is an ideal fit due to its reliance on data and analysis. Intelligent Alpha has launched a first-of-its-kind ETF named after famed stock trader Jesse Livermore. The ETF uses OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini to construct a global equity portfolio. As per Clinton, firms that get on board with AI could gain an edge with a price tag of millions of dollars. “What it does is it adds some intelligence to indexes, which are just definitionally sort of a set of rules that can’t be smart. And they also take that emotion out of the active side where human beings are still making decisions, but we get caught up. You know, we make mistakes and sometimes those compound. And so I think by fixing those two issues, AI has the potential to really capture a lot of value in terms of assets flowing to these new AI-powered funds.” - Intelligent Alpha CEO Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 308 Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American technology company offering e-commerce, cloud computing, and other services, including digital streaming and artificial intelligence solutions. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) uses artificial intelligence for everything from reinventing shopping experiences to automated ad creatives, streamlining healthcare access, and more with generative AI powered by Amazon Web Services. In its latest step in advancing its reach towards AI, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has struck a five-year deal with startup Databricks, a data and artificial intelligence company. This deal can potentially help businesses looking to cut costs when building their own artificial intelligence capabilities by developing custom generative AI models built with Databricks Mosaic AI on AWS. Databricks will be using Amazon’s Trainium AI chips for powering the training and serving of their large language models, providing joint customers with unmatched scale, performance, and cost-efficiency for their generative AI applications. While many tech analysts and business leaders don’t consider Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a leader in AI innovation, its AI chips, Trainium and Inferentia, are helping it change the narrative and that too, cost-efficiently. “Generative AI is disrupting every industry and a company’s data will ultimately be its competitive advantage. Strengthening our collaboration with AWS allows us to provide customers with unmatched scale and price-performance so they can bring their own generative AI applications to market more rapidly”. -Ali Ghodsi, Co-founder and CEO at Databricks. Overall, AMZN ranks 1st among the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61 Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is an American multinational digital communications technology conglomerate corporation offering a vast portfolio of technology innovations. The company has integrated AI-powered capabilities across many of its products, introduced a $1 billion fund earlier this year to invest in AI startups, and even maintains a strong foothold in cybersecurity, offering AI-powered security tools, and much more. On Wednesday, October 16, Citigroup analysts upgraded the stock to “Buy” from “Neutral” and raised the price target to $62 from $52 per share. This reflects an estimated 15% upside from Tuesday’s close. According to Citi analysts, investors shouldn’t overlook the artificial intelligence potential of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). The upgrade in the networking company’s shares by analyst Atif Malik highlights a narrowing valuation gap relative to peers, as well as a rapidly expanding AI Ethernet total addressable market that is projected to reach $10 billion by 2025. “While AI is currently a small piece of the biz (~2% of revs), we see the potential for a stronger contribution,” he wrote. “With more AI coming, we are incrementally more constructive on the group and expect continued investor rotation out of semis/hardware into networking equipment to benefit group valuation.” Furthermore, the addition of the company’s products in Meta Platforms’ AI hardware comes as a “positive validation of CSCO’s technology.” With at least three major hyperscalers already using its tools in their backend networks, Malik believes that the company’s $9 billion 2027 hyperscaler AI opportunity forecast may be “potentially understated”. The analyst has also increased his earnings per share estimates for 2025 and 2026 by 2% and 5%, respectively. “We believe shares warrant a sizable discount to networking peer valuation to reflect lingering share loss concerns, somewhat tempered by growing AI opportunities. Even at a 30+% discounted target multiple to peer average, we see meaningful upside to shares”. Overall CSCO ranks 8th on our list of AI news investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of CSCO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This increase follows a five-year low of 3.65% in August. 2)The food inflation, which accounts for around half of the overall CPI basket, jumped to 9.24 per cent in September from 5.66 per cent in the previous month, the data showed. The inflation rate for vegetables grew 35.99 per cent in August as against 10.71 per cent in the previous month, while pulses & products inflation eased to 9.81 per cent as against 13.6 per cent in August. 3)Rural inflation quickened to 5.87 per cent as against 4.16 per cent in August, whereas urban inflation accelerated to 5.05 per cent as compared to 3.14 per cent in the previous month. 4)India’s wholesale inflation rose to 1.84% in September from 1.31% in August, driven by changes in the Wholesale Price Index covering primary articles, fuel, and manufactured products. The RBI’s MPC retained the repo rate and adjusted inflation projections, maintaining a neutral stance amidst varied inflation and growth trends. 5)India’s forex reserves contracted by $10.7 billion to $690 billion as of October 11, with foreign currency assets reducing by $10.5 billion to $602 billion. Gold reserves and SDRs also saw a dip, while the RBI continues managing market volatility to prevent steep rupee depreciation. 6)India’s merchandise trade deficit narrowed to a five-month low of $20.78 billion in September as imports grew at the slowest pace in six months and exports rose marginally after two months of decline, the official data showed. The trade deficit, or the gap between imports and exports, had widened to a 10-month high of $29.65 billion in August. Goods worth $55.36 billion were imported last month, up 1.62 per cent compared to the year-ago period, amid softening global petroleum prices. In September, exports rose by 0.5 per cent to $34.58 billion due to muted global demand amid geopolitical challenges, according to the data. 7)According to Primedatabase, in H1FY25, funds raised by NBFCs from debt capital markets totaled to Rs 3.23 trillion, up 3.11 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) during the same period last year. In 2024 so far (upto September), this number adds up to Rs 5.09 trillion, up almost 4 per cent Y-o-Y. 8)India’s GDP is expected to grow at 6.95% in the current financial year, which is about 25 basis points (bps) lower than the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) forecast, according to a note by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). 9)At the India Credit Forum hosted by Bloomberg, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das addressed key economic concerns, stating that inflation in October is expected to remain sticky but may ease in November and December, although upside risks persist. He emphasized that the RBI is not behind the curve on policy rates and the upcoming December decision will hinge on the inflation outlook rather than external factors like U.S. elections. Das clarified that the RBI doesn’t manage exchange rates but responds to market demand and supply, countering market assumptions. Regarding growth, he highlighted that India, as a large economy, must rely on multiple growth levers, not solely manufacturing or services. He also noted the need for more institutional investors, especially Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), in India’s bond markets, where only 15% of the allocated space is currently utilized. However, FIIs’ biggest hurdle remains the complex KYC process and UBO declarations, which are constrained by FATF regulations. 10)The mutual fund industry AUM hit an all-time high of Rs 67.90 lakh crore in September, led by net inflows across open-ended categories and mark-to-market (MTM) gains in the equity market. The industry’s AUM increased from Rs 66.70 lakh crore in August, reflecting growth of Rs 0.39 lakh crore or 0.58% over the previous month, according to a monthly note by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). WORLD 1)OPEC said in its monthly report that the world oil demand will rise by 1.93 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 -106,000 barrels per day less previously estimated, or the growth of 2.03 million bpd it expected last month. 2)As of October 17, 2024, the US initial jobless claims were 241,000, which is a 7.31% decrease from the previous week and a 14.22% increase from one year ago. 3)The price index for US exports fell 2.1% year-on-year in September, the largest 12-month decrease since January 2024. This was due to lower prices for nonagricultural exports, which more than offset higher agricultural export prices. The price index for US imports fell 0.1% year-on-year in September. This was due to cheaper energy products. 4)Retail Sales in the United States increased 1.7% year-on-year in September 2024, the smallest yearly gain since January, following an upwardly revised 2.2% rise in August. Retail Sales YoY in the United States averaged 4.74 percent from 1993 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 52.50 percent in April of 2021 and a record low of -19.90 percent in April of 2020. 5)Industrial Production in the United States decreased 0.6% year-on-year in September 2024, the biggest decline in five months, following a downwardly revised 0.2% fall in August. Mining sank 2.2% and manufacturing contracted 0.5% while production of utilities increased 0.6%. 6)The United States saw a 0.5% year-on-year decline in manufacturing production in September 2024, following a downwardly revised flat reading in August. Over the long term, U.S. manufacturing production has averaged 3.56% from 1920 to 2024, with an all-time high of 67.90% in July 1933 and a record low of -39.40% in February 1946. 7)The United Kingdom’s (UK) ILO Unemployment Rate eased to 4.0% in the three months to August, following July’s 4.1% reading, the data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed. Additional details of the report showed that the number of people claiming jobless benefits increased by 27.9K in September, compared with a gain of 23.7K in August, missing the expected 20.2K print. 8)The annual inflation rate in the UK fell to 1.7% in September 2024, the lowest reading since April 2021 and driven down by lower airfare and petrol prices, compared to 2.2% in each of the previous two months and forecasts of 1.9%. Meanwhile the core inflation rate fell to 3.2% from 3.6% in the previous months. 9)In the UK, producer input prices fell by 2.3% in September 2024, further declining from a revised decrease of 1.0% in August, while producer output (factory gate) prices dropped by 0.7%, down from a revised increase of 0.3% in the previous month. On a monthly basis, input prices decreased by 1.0%, and output prices fell by 0.5% in September 2024. In contrast, UK services producer prices rose by 3.3% in the year to Quarter 3 (July to September) 2024, slightly up from a revised increase of 3.2% in Quarter 2 (April to June). 10)The Retail Price Index in the United Kingdom advanced by 2.7% year-on-year in September 2024, easing from a 3.5% rise in the previous month and below market expectations of a 3.1% gain. On a monthly basis, the RPI fell by 0.3%, reversing from a 0.6% increase in the prior period and compared to market forecasts of a 0.1% rise. 11)The Governing Council decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rates on the deposit facility, the main refinancing operations and the marginal lending facility will be decreased to 3.25%, 3.40% and 3.65% respectively, with effect from 23 October 2024. 12)The euro area annual inflation rate was 1.7% in September 2024, down from 2.2% in August. A year earlier, the rate was 4.3%. European Union annual inflation was 2.1% in September 2024, down from 2.4% in August. The core inflation rate in the Eurozone was 2.7% in September 2024, down from 2.8% in August 2024. 13)The Euro Area recorded a trade surplus of 4583.60 EUR Million in August of 2024. Balance of Trade in Euro Area averaged 5584.95 EUR Million from 1999 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 29946.10 EUR Million in July of 2015 and a record low of -55033.30 EUR Million in August of 2022. 14)Japan’s trade balance shifted to a deficit of JPY 294.24 billion in September 2024 from a surplus of JPY 60.56 billion in the same month a year earlier. It was the third straight month of a trade gap, coming in worse than market forecast of a shortfall of JPY 237.6 billion, with exports unexpectedly shrinking while imports grew. Sales declined by 1.7% to JPY 9,038.20 billion, marking the first drop since November 2023 and missing consensus of a 0.5% rise. Meantime, imports rose 2.1% to JPY 9,332.55 billion, pointing to the sixth straight month of expansion but falling short of estimates of 3.2%. 15)Japanese inflation slowed in September with prices up 2.4 percent on-year, not including volatile fresh food, official data showed Friday. The core Consumer Price Index eased from 2.8 percent to 2.4% percent in August as the pace of increase in electricity and gas prices relented, the internal affairs ministry said. 16)China’s debt-to-GDP ratio hit a jaw-dropping 366% in Q1 2024, a new all-time high. Since the 2008 Financial Crisis, the ratio has doubled. To put this differently, for 1 unit of GDP, the Chinese economy has produced 3.66 units of debt burden. 17)China recorded a trade surplus of 81.71 USD Billion in September of 2024. Balance of Trade in China averaged 16.08 USD Billion from 1981 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 125.16 USD Billion in February of 2024 and a record low of -61.99 USD Billion in February of 2020. 18)The Chinese economy expanded 4.6% yoy in Q3 of 2024, compared with market forecasts of 4.5% and a 4.7% rise in Q2. It marked the slowest annual growth rate since Q1 2023, amid persistent property weakness, shaky domestic demand, deflation risks, and trade frictions with the West. 19)China’s retail sales climbed by 3.2% year-on-year in September 2024 from 2.1% gain in the previous month, easily beating market estimates of 2.5% rise. 20)In September 2024, China’s industrial production increased by 5.4% year-on-year, which was higher than the 4.6% market forecast and the 4.5% increase in August. This was the fastest expansion in industrial output since May and the first acceleration in five months. 21)China’s surveyed unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in September 2024, compared to market estimates and August’s reading of 5.3%. This marks the lowest reading in three months. The jobless rate for locally registered residents decreased by 0.2 percentage points to 5.2%, at which non-local registrants had a rate of 4.8%, while the rate for non-local agricultural registrants stood at 4.6%. In 31 major cities, the urban unemployment rate was also 5.1%. 22)The Philippine central bank reduced its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday for a second meeting and left the door open to further cuts with medium-term inflation expected to stay within its 2%-4% target range.

and Sensex clocked new peaks in September, with the former crossing the psychological 26,000 mark. A bumper rate cut by the US Fed and a resilient American economy bolstered investors’ confidence. FIIs remained net sellers in domestic equities for the fourth consecutive month. Yet, the markets had a hard landing as they set foot into October, facing the sharpest decline since June. Rising tensions in the Middle East and a fresh set of derivative norms did dent sentiments. But the key trigger for correction was the huge selling pressure by FIIs in early October. The massive stimulus by the Chinese government created an opportunity for hot money to look for tactical trade in terms of buying China at the expense of other emerging markets. In fact, the selloffs from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) amounted to Rs. 27,142 crore in just the first three days of October, leading to a decline of 5-5.5% in the Nifty from its recent peak. Fortunately, the BJP pulled off a miraculous victory in Haryana state elections that suddenly changed the mood in the Indian equity markets. The opposition had the advantage of a two-term incumbency against the ruling party, BJP, along with some other crucial factors. However, the BJP has romped home with a comfortable majority which is far ahead of even the most optimistic expectations. The victory in Haryana would boost confidence of their cadre in Delhi and Maharashtra – the two states scheduled to go for elections soon. In terms of events ahead, the market has to deal with Q2 results season, which is likely to turn out to be another quarter of muted growth in Nifty earnings. The consensus is building 4-4.5% growth in the Nifty earnings due to high base effect, pressure on margins and moderation in earnings growth in heavyweight sectors such as banking and energy. Globally, there are elections scheduled in the US. Also, the market would want to watch for progress in the rate cut cycle along with impact of the intensifying Middle East crisis on the crude oil and commodity prices. Given the macro environment and valuation concerns post the rally in post couple of months, it would be healthy if the markets take a breather and consolidate in a range. Moreover, the stock-specific volatility could rise in the Q2 result season as some of the pockets of stocks in the broader market do look overheated with little valuation comfort at the current level. The consolidation phase could offer an opportunity for investors to accumulate good quality stocks at prices that are 10-25% lower than their recent peak. Do keep the big picture in mind. The Indian economy is on a multi-year upcycle with all engines of growth firing like rising infrastructure spending, real estate upturn and beginning of a new privatesector capex cycle.

Title: Should you buy Nvidia stock now? It may be a once-in-a-generation opportunity

Nvidia has been one of the most hyped and closely followed stocks in recent memory as the fortunes of the broader market increasingly hinge on the AI chip leader. At one point this year, the stock accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500’s gains, and some investors even held watch parties for Nvidia’s earnings release. Nvidia’s astronomical run to a $3 trillion company has also been somewhat divisive as many on Wall Street have doubted that the stock can sustain further gains while others see the AI boom fueling more upside. That’s left investors asking, “Should I buy Nvidia stock right now, or sell it?” Analysts at Bank of America have an answer: In a note on Thursday, they reiterated their buy rating on Nvidia stock and raised their price target to $190 from $165, implying it could soar 38% higher from Friday’s closing price. At $190 a share, Nvidia’s market cap would also explode to $4.7 trillion, from $3.4 trillion today. In fact, BofA is so bullish on Nvidia stock that analysts called it a “generational opportunity,” estimating a total addressable market of more than $400 billion for AI accelerators. “AI models (demand) continue to evolve, with the cadence of new LLM model launches now increased to 3-5 times/yr per developer (OpenAI, Google, Meta, etc.), and each new major generation requiring 10-20x compute requirement to train,” analysts said. Their confidence in Nvidia has been boosted by others in the chip sector like Taiwan Semiconductor and ASML, which both recently signaled strong AI demand. BofA’s meetings with executives at Broadcom and Micron as well as comments from AMD have yielded similar indications. Meanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also touted huge demand for the company’s next-generation AI chip. “Blackwell is in full production. Blackwell is as planned, and the demand for Blackwell is insane,” he told CNBC earlier this month. “Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.” Adding to BofA’s bullish case for Nvidia is its underappreciated enterprise partnerships with the likes of Accenture, ServiceNow, Microsoft, and others as well as its software products that help reinforce Nvidia’s dominance in hardware. They combine to create a deeper overall Nvidia ecosystem for AI. Plus, Nvidia could generate more than $200 billion in free cash flow over the next two years, rivaling even Apple, BofA estimated. Earnings reports later this month from tech giants that are developing AI technologies, such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, should provide more insight into demand. And Nvidia is due to report Nov. 20. While some on Wall Street have expressed skepticism on whether massive investments in AI are translating to the bottom line, the tech sector is locked in a cutthroat race to be first on the scene with the latest advances in AI. “We continue to see the pace of new model development increase,” BofA said. “LLMs in particular are being developed for both larger size and better reasoning capabilities, which both require greater training intensity.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: NVIDIA (NVDA): Among the Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other profitable stocks. In an interview with CNBC on October 14, Michael Kantrowitz, Chief Investment Officer at Piper Sandler noted that while the market is expensive, it's not a reason to get bearish and that unless a risk arises, the market will likely stay expensive. Kantrowitz explains that the market's valuation is driven by the pricing out of risks that existed two years ago, such as inflation and higher interest rates. He believes that if these risks were to resurface, it would be a reason to get worried, but currently, that's not the backdrop. He also notes that investors should focus on stocks with continued earnings momentum, as these names will likely see the best outperformance and can hold their expensive multiples for longer. Kantrowitz is not too concerned about higher bond yields but notes that they can be a problem at some point. He thinks that yields would need to reach 4.25% to show up in the broader market. Regarding earnings revisions, Kantrowitz believes that revisions coming down have not overdone it and that it's normal to see estimates from the sell-side start out high and then trickle down throughout the year. He expects to see more downward earnings revisions but notes that large-cap stocks have held up far better in terms of earnings, which is why they continue to outperform. Tom Lee, Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors discussed the markets and his recent observations. Lee believes that the market's resilience is due to the large amount of cash on the sidelines. He thinks that investors have been under-invested in stocks and that the market is becoming less dependent on macro data. Lee pointed out that the market has been able to shrug off negative news and that the recent PPI and CPI reports were not enough to knock the market off track. He believes that the Fed will continue to be dovish, especially since inflation is still tracking towards the 2% target. Lee also thinks that the election, which is becoming less of a coin toss, is also contributing to the market's conviction. Regarding the impact of the election on the market, Lee believes that markets like visibility, but they also need to like what they see on the other side of the election. He thinks that whether Trump or Harris wins, stocks will do well next year, but there will be differences in sector and asset class performance depending on who wins. While some may be concerned about the market's expensive valuation, others see it as a sign of strength and resilience, with that in context, let’s take a look at the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years. Our Methodology To compile our list of the 10 most profitable stocks of the last 10 years, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 30 largest companies by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to companies with positive TTM net income and 10-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 10-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income. Our list is sorted in ascending order of the 10-year net income growth rates. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 smallcap and largecap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. 10-Year Net Income CAGR: 58.47% TTM Net Income: $53.01 Billion Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) and a pioneer in AI, gaming, and data center technology. The company’s GPUs are widely utilized in gaming, deep learning, and high-performance computing. NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI and machine learning solutions have been adopted across various industries, including healthcare, automotive, and finance. Notable customers include Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Tesla. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is positioned for ongoing growth, driven by its strong presence in the data center market and the upcoming Blackwell chip. Blackwell is highly sought after by companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta, who are building AI data centers to support their products. The Blackwell GPUs, priced between $30,000 and $40,000 each, are already being distributed to data centers and industrial customers for AI applications, with consumer availability expected in 2025. In a CNBC interview, CEO Jensen Huang remarked that "Blackwell is in full production and demand for Blackwell is insane," adding, "Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first." NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) leadership in accelerated computing and generative AI is also a key factor in its growth outlook. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is poised to benefit from the expanding enterprise AI market, along with growing opportunities in the automotive and healthcare sectors, as its products and solutions gain traction in these areas. In Q2, global spending on cloud infrastructure rose by 19% year-over-year to $78.2 billion, according to Canalys. Hyperscalers are expected to spend approximately $160 billion on AI infrastructure in 2024. With its robust position in the data center market and emerging opportunities in various industries, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and drive further growth. Analysts estimate that the company’s earnings will grow by 81.88% this year. With a consensus Buy rating from industry analysts, the stock has a target price of $148.53, which represents a 12.08% upside potential from its current level. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the most profitable stocks of the last 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is poised to benefit from the expanding enterprise AI market, along with growing opportunities in the automotive and healthcare sectors, as its products and solutions gain traction in these areas. In Q2, global spending on cloud infrastructure rose by 19% year-over-year to $78.2 billion, according to Canalys. Hyperscalers are expected to spend approximately $160 billion on AI infrastructure in 2024. With its robust position in the data center market and emerging opportunities in various industries, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and drive further growth. Analysts estimate that the company’s earnings will grow by 81.88% this year. With a consensus Buy rating from industry analysts, the stock has a target price of $148.53, which represents a 12.08% upside potential from its current level. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the most profitable stocks of the last 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Internet of Things (IoT) Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other IoT stocks. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vast network connecting physical objects to the internet. Industries are embracing IoT technologies for applications like smart manufacturing and supply chain management. Enterprise IoT spending is expected to slow down in the second half of this year due to economic concerns which will affect corporate spending in general. However, corporate spending on IoT will rebound in 2025. The global market for IoT is expected to grow at a rate of 24.3% annually between 2024 and 2032. In 2032, it is expected to reach a value of $4,062.34 billion. The rise of smart homes, buildings, and manufacturing, along with advancements in smart infrastructure, is driving significant growth in the IoT market. Moreover, smart city initiatives are becoming increasingly prevalent due to the growing population and expansion of cities. Consumers are adopting smart city solutions, including smart utility meters, transportation, waste management, grids, and air quality controllers. IoT adoption is also growing rapidly in other sectors, particularly healthcare. The global IoT in healthcare market is projected to expand significantly and reach $952.3 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18%. IoT is a major force behind healthcare's digital transformation, revolutionizing the way medical data is collected, analyzed, and used. This is leading to better patient care, greater operational efficiencies, and innovative treatments. IoT is also seeing increased adoption in warehouse management. The global IoT warehouse management market is projected to grow from $14.8 billion in 2023 to $57.2 billion by 2033, reflecting a CAGR of 14.5% over the next decade. This growth is driven by the need for better inventory management, increased automation, and improved operational efficiency in logistics and supply chain operations.

Wi-Fi accounts for 31% of all IoT connections. On the other hand, Bluetooth is used by 25% of connected IoT devices, and cellular IoT, including 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE-M, and NB-IoT, accounts for nearly 21% of global IoT connections. A key trend in the IoT market for 2024 is the integration of AI technologies, including generative AI and edge AI, into IoT devices. Edge AI, in particular, is transforming the IoT landscape. By allowing IoT devices to process and store data locally, edge AI reduces lag and allows real-time responses. Incorporating AI into IoT devices within industries offers numerous benefits, including improved operational efficiency, safety, and decision-making. It plays an important role in predictive maintenance and supply chain management. The future of IoT looks promising. Businesses and investors can expect significant returns as the technology continues to evolve. Keeping this context in mind, let’s take a look at the best IoT stocks to buy now. To create our list of the 10 best IoT stocks to buy, we focused on companies that offer IoT solutions or products, including firms involved in manufacturing IoT devices and hardware. The companies have been shortlisted based on hedge fund sentiment, sourced from our database of over 900 hedge funds. The best IoT stocks have been ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding a stake in them as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 219 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the tech giant formerly known as Facebook, has been taking significant steps to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to improve its social media platforms. The company's recent introduction of AI-powered image editing tools and new chat stickers on Instagram is a prime example of this strategy. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has demonstrated impressive financial performance over the past decade, with a compound annual revenue growth rate of 29.7%. As the global digital ad market is going to expand significantly, reaching over $1 trillion by 2030, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has maintained an average operating margin of 34.8% in the past five years. These strong financials are fueled by cost-cutting measures and a focus on operational efficiency. Meta's substantial cash reserves of $58.1 billion and free cash flow generation of $10.9 billion reported during the most recent quarter enable it to invest aggressively in AI initiatives. The stock has received a consensus rating of “Strong Buy” from analysts. Here’s what Mar Vista Investment Partners, LLC said about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “During the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company’s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street’s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels). The subsequent decline in Meta’s stock price during 2022 reflected these concerns. Overall META ranks 3rd on our list of the best IoT stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The US Consumer Is Healthy And This 10% Dividend Will Profit
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2024/10/20/the-us-consumer-is-healthy-and-this-10-dividend-will-profit/
Time Published: 2024-10-20T13:59:00Z
Full Content:
Strengthening and building your savings Last year, the White House published a blog post titled “As the US Consumer Goes, So Goes the US Economy.” No matter what your politics are, I think we can all agree that America’s economy depends on consumers buying things. For us income investors, then, the consumer’s health is a key thing to watch, as it ultimately sets the direction of stocks. So how healthy is the US consumer today, and can we confidently buy stocks—and better still, high-yielding CEFs like the one we’ll talk about below (current yield: 10%)? Often, the signals are murky. America is, after all, a big country with a lot of people in it, and some of those people are obviously doing better than others, so it’s tricky to zero in on the overall health of consumers. Still, there are some things every consumer is sensitive to and, ultimately, will affect everyone’s spending. The biggest variable, as you can likely guess, is inflation. Inflation/SPY In 2021, as we all know well, inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (in orange above) started climbing. That caused stocks to tank in 2022, as spiraling prices of everyday things forced pretty well everyone, no matter how rich, to cut back to varying degrees. But see how the orange line kept going down? The CPI is now back around pre-pandemic levels. With that in mind, you’d expect US consumers to boost their spending again. And they have. Fun Spending This is an obscure metric, but it’s important: how much Americans spend on recreation services (think movie tickets, concerts, hotels, amusement parks and such). After the pandemic slump, inflation slowed the recovery to the pre-pandemic trendline in 2021 and 2022. Growth recovered in 2023 and has kept strengthening so far in 2024. In short, Americans have more money to spend on fun because 2022’s inflationary pressures have started to ebb. Here’s another interesting chart on the health of the consumer: Household Debt/Income What this shows us is that, if you take the average US household and count up its debt, the total amounts to less than 100% of their disposable (or after-tax) income. In other words, putting 100% of that income toward their debt could erase their borrowings in less than a year (which is obviously impossible but useful for context here). Contrast that with other wealthy nations, like Canada and Australia, where households would need a year and 10 months. Combine healthy US household balance sheets and higher spending on recreation and it’s hard to conclude that, generally speaking, the US consumer is anything but healthy. A strong consumer means a strong economy and strong corporate earnings. That, in turn, translates to larger returns to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. In 2023, S&P 500 firms spent over $800 billion buying back shares from investors, while giving them over $500 billion in cash dividends. You can be one of the people getting a “paycheck” from companies like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V) when you invest in an index fund like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY Principal Shareholder Yield Index ETF SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ). But don’t expect that to turn into a big cash flow overnight. With SPY yielding just 1.2%, even a million dollars in this fund won’t replace more than $1,000 per month in income—hardly a living wage! But we can speed that up without sacrificing quality if we instead buy a fund like the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA), one of my favorite closed-end funds (CEFs). USA invests in US mid-cap and large-cap firms: Its portfolio holds Apple, Microsoft, Visa and many other top S&P 500 names. While its holdings resemble those of SPY, its dividend does not. USA turns gains and dividends from the stocks it holds into an income stream for investors, which is how it can pay out a far bigger dividend than SPY: 10%, to be exact. Based on USA’s yield (note that its payout does fluctuate a bit, based on the fund’s portfolio returns), a million-dollar portfolio now pays $8,333 averaged out on a monthly basis—higher than the average American’s paycheck. But will the income stream hold? A 10% yield seems unrealistically high, which is why a lot of people scoff when I show them facts like these. So let’s look at history. USA Dividend USA’s payout has steadily risen with the stock market over the last decade. As long as consumers have money to spend, giving companies revenue they can translate into profits for their shareholders, USA will be able to pump that dividend number up further. Finally, let’s talk about USA’s discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the fund’s underlying portfolio). As I write this, the fund trades just a hair over par. While we prefer discounted CEFs, that’s reasonable for USA, given its strong management and outsized yield. We’ve also seen the fund trade at healthy premiums (north of 4%) as recently as July 2023. Nonetheless, if you prefer to buy at a discount, I get it. In that case, go ahead and put USA on your watch list. Given the fund’s very slight premium, it wouldn’t take much to push it back into discount territory. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Investors seeking sustainable returns will need to look for companies with solid long-term growth potential. To this end, top Wall Street analysts, with their expertise, can help investors understand the key drivers that could support a company's long-term growth and pick stocks that are likely to deliver lucrative returns. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is cybersecurity company Fortinet (FTNT). The company aims to become a leader in the secure access service edge space. Fortinet leverages machine learning and AI technologies to offer cybersecurity solutions. Recently, TD Cowen analyst Shaul Eyal reaffirmed a buy rating on Fortinet stock and raised the price target to $90 from $75. The analyst stated that channel checks and discussions with industry participants indicate continued recovery in FTNT's business and healthy demand across the company's broad product portfolio. In fact, channel checks suggest that Fortinet's third-quarter revenue and billings will reach the top end of the company's outlook, with the possibility of a modest upside. Also, the analyst is confident about his Q4 revenue growth estimate of 12%, given "healthy closure rates and further pipeline building into a seasonally strong 4Q24." Eyal also noted that one of the key drivers supporting Fortinet's ongoing recovery is the solid traction in the company's operational technology products, backed by a long-term replacement cycle that will replace legacy OT systems. The analyst added that FTNT is also gaining from the adoption of AI-led networks and the company's growing focus on cloud security, which was bolstered by the recent acquisition of Lacework. Eyal ranks No. 12 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 71% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.3%. (See Fortinet Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks) We move on to GitLab (GTLB), an AI-powered, cloud-based software company that helps organizations enhance developer productivity, improve operational efficiency, and reduce security and compliance risks. Following meetings with the company's management, Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz reiterated a buy rating on GitLab stock with a price target of $62. The analyst noted that management is highly confident about capturing further opportunities in the $40 billion total addressable market. Currently, the two vendors, GitLab and Microsoft's GitHub, together account for just about 5% of the market share in the software development life cycle space. In particular, management expects the momentum for GitLab's Duo Pro product to pick up in 2025, fueled by the generative AI wave. The analyst also highlighted the company's optimism about the GitLab Dedicated offering, which is witnessing better-than-anticipated customer interest and driving higher average revenue per unit. Overall, Moskowitz remains "constructive on GTLB's ability to execute and grow at a high level over the medium-to-longer term, due in large part to multiple upside levers that include seat expansion, price increases, and upsell potential." Moskowitz ranks No. 321 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.6%. (See GitLab's Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks) Finally, let's look at semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA). The company has been seeing stellar revenue growth rates, driven by robust demand for its advanced GPUs (graphics processing units) in building artificial intelligence models and applications. Following an investor meeting with Nvidia's management, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated a buy rating on NVDA stock and raised the price target to $150 from $135. The analyst's optimism after the meeting reflects a "better appreciation of the company's competitive moat and, importantly, the projected increase in Inference workload complexity as well as its implications for future compute demand." Hari noted Nvidia's confidence about the demand backdrop, given continued spending on accelerated computing and GPUs by data center operators amid the generative AI wave. Management also highlighted the prospects for its Blackwell platform. The analyst thinks that Blackwell's launch and ramp-up are not just near- and medium-term revenue growth drivers, but also key factors that will enhance Nvidia's competitive advantage. Hari increased his revenue estimates for fiscal 2025-2027 to reflect recent industry developments like increased cloud spending, solid order trends at the major AI server original equipment manufacturers like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and an improved chip-on-wafer-on-substrate shipment outlook. Hari ranks No. 32 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 68% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.5%.

Title: Details Better Than The Headline This Earnings Season
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/10/20/details-better-than-the-headline-this-earnings-season/
Time Published: 2024-10-20T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
The blended earnings performance has underperformed expectations at the end of the quarter, but 79% ... [+] of S&P 500 firms have reported better-than-expected earnings this season. Within the S&P 500, 42 companies reported earnings last week. 79% of S&P 500 firms have reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The third-quarter earnings season enters its second busiest reporting week, with 112 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Among the companies scheduled include Coca-Cola (KO), Tesla (TSLA), Union Pacific (UNP), 3M (MMM), and Honeywell (HON). A more detailed preview of the earnings season is available here. S&P 500 Earnings Season The S&P 500 rose by 0.9% for the week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), had a gain of 0.7%. Interestingly, despite the S&P 500 setting a new all-time closing high on Friday, the Magnificent 7 remains about 5% below its July high. However, the Magnificent 7 still dominates the year-to-date performance. Stock Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical outperformed, the less economically exposed defensive stocks. The spike in cyclical outperformance followed the much better-than-expected monthly jobs report, which removed the short-term fear of recession. The outperformance of smaller-capitalization stocks is another sign that markets are becoming less concerned about the risk of recession. Cyclicals Versus Defensives The financials sector was the most significant contributor to earnings growth, led by JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Progressive (PGR), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Morgan Stanley (MS), according to FactSet. Conversely, the energy, healthcare, and industrials sectors have been the most significant detractors of S&P 500 earnings growth. Earnings estimates for energy companies, including Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), were cut, sending the energy sector estimates to -26.0% year-over-year after expecting a -19.1% at the start of the earnings season. Boeing (BA) announced much worse than expected preliminary results last week, which caused analysts to slash earnings estimates, sending the industrials sector estimates to -8.4% year-over-year versus 1.3% growth at the start of the earnings season. Boeing is scheduled to make its official earnings report on Wednesday. Healthcare sector earnings, expected to be a bright spot this quarter, have fallen to an expected 5.7% growth rate compared to 11.2% year-over-year at the end of the quarter. The primary culprit was Eli Lilly (LLY), which saw earnings estimates revised lower after an announcement that acquisition-related charges for in-process research and development (IPR&D) would lower profits by approximately $2.83 billion or $3.08 per share. 3Q 2024 Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, combining after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. With nominal GDP growth likely solid year-over-year for the first quarter, topline revenue growth for companies should have a tailwind. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth has matched expectations. 3Q 2024 Sales Growth By Sector So far, the blended earnings performance has underperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +3.4% year-over-year, below the expectation of +4.4% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary Based on the better-than-expected consumer spending data last week, the Atlanta Fed estimates 3.4% 3Q GDP growth. The hurricanes and the threatened dock worker strike complicate the analysis of economic data since the more robust retail sales could have been driven by pulling forward demand, which will then be a headwind for upcoming consumer spending data. In any case, the economy remains resilient; it is just a matter of how strong the normalized growth is. 3Q 2024 U.S. GDP Growth Estimate The additional rate cuts expected in 2024 are two successive 25 basis point (0.25%) cuts in November and December. While the probability, based on the pricing of Fed Fund futures, remains high, they have fallen from even higher conviction levels as recent economic data has been robust. Federal Reserve Expected Rate Cuts The heart of earnings season kicks off this week with the laggard of the Magnificent 7, Tesla (TSLA), reporting earnings. Even though the current estimated third-quarter earnings growth doesn’t reflect it yet, almost eighty percent of companies have outperformed earnings forecasts. Forward guidance remains critical, with less fear of an economic downturn and consensus estimates calling for double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter and 2025. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL), Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Coca-Cola (KO), Visa (V), Union Pacific (UNP), 3M (MMM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Honeywell (HON) within its recommended investment strategies.

On Monday, Morgan Stanley downgraded Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) to Underweight with a $332 price target. *TLDR: Morgan Stanley sees mounting pressures and potential de-stocking downturn for CAT’s Construction Industries. Analysts predict 2025 EPS 10% below consensus, suggesting negative risk-reward for CAT shares. What’s the full story? Morgan Stanley analysts see mounting pressures for Caterpillar’s Construction Industries segment. They have been cautious about US Non-Residential construction activity and CAT earnings throughout the year. Now, they observe rising evidence of a potential de-stocking downturn for US construction equipment. Factors such as optimistic expectations of non-residential growth driven by near-shoring, a normalizing supply chain, an increasingly competitive market, and deteriorating used equipment markets have led to bloated channel inventories that need to be de-stocked. As a result, the analysts foresee increased risk of downward earnings revisions for CAT, with their 2025 EPS estimate now 10% below consensus. Combined with CAT shares’ year-to-date outperformance and a valuation that places an above mid-cycle multiple on what they believe are closer to peak earnings, the analysts suggest a negative risk-reward scenario. Underweight at Morgan Stanley means “The stock's total return is expected to be below the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months.” What happened? On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs downgraded Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) to Sell with a $45 price target. *TLDR: Goldman Sachs issues Sell rating for Etsy due to persistent GMS declines and low growth visibility. Analysts foresee further negative revisions and unfavorable risk/reward despite Etsy’s YTD underperformance. What’s the full story? Goldman Sachs has issued a Sell rating for Etsy, citing three main concerns. Firstly, the bank notes that Gross Merchandise Sales (GMS) declines have persisted longer than expected, with low visibility on a return to positive growth, contrary to the Street’s 2025 GMS forecast of +3% year-over-year. Secondly, Goldman Sachs expects Etsy to continue losing market share in global eCommerce (excluding China) due to muted active buyer growth and an increasingly competitive market. Lastly, the bank warns that Street Adjusted EBITDA estimates could be revised lower if GMS declines persist or if Etsy increases growth investments, which would reduce valuation support for the shares. Despite Etsy’s 39% year-to-date stock underperformance, Goldman Sachs sees an unfavorable risk/reward scenario due to the potential for further negative revisions to medium-term consensus estimates. Sell at Goldman Sachs means “Being assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock’s total return potential relative to its coverage universe.” What happened? On Wednesday, HSBC downgraded Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) to Hold with a $100 price target. *TLDR: EL’s restructuring affects staff morale and risks losing quality managers. Internal candidates likely to replace CEO Freda; future management should influence restructuring. What’s the full story? HSBC is not expecting the shake-up it believes is necessary. As the restructuring progresses, it comes with collateral damage, affecting staff morale and potentially leading to the loss of quality managers who may find it difficult to trust their career paths within the firm. HSBC now views the implementation of the cost-cutting program as an indication that the replacement of CEO Freda will likely be an internal candidate. Given the length of non-compete clauses in the sector, if an external candidate had been secured, the market would have likely heard about it by now. Future management should have a say in what is cut and what is enhanced. Stéphane de la Faverie, executive group president, and Jane Lauder, executive VP of enterprise marketing and chief data officer, are leading the restructuring program together. It would be logical for the group to be led by one or both of them. However, despite their qualities, they are partly responsible for the group’s track record and might find it challenging to implement the type of reset or cultural change that HSBC feels is needed. Hold at HSBC means “… the stock may be classified as a Buy or a Hold; when it is between 5% below and 5% above the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Hold; when it is between 5% and 20% below the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Hold or a Reduce…” What happened? On Thursday, B.. Riley upgraded Alcoa (NYSE:AA) to Buy with a $50 price target *TLDR: Alcoa’s Q3 adjusted EBITDA of $455M beat estimates; B. Riley upgrades to Buy. B. Riley raises 2025 EBITDA estimate to $2.4B, citing strong cash flow and alumina prices. What’s the full story? On Wednesday Alcoa reported a third-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $455 million, surpassing B. Riley’s estimate of $383 million and the FactSet consensus of $386 million. The brokerage attributed this beat primarily to lower-than-expected intersegment eliminations. As a result, B. Riley has upgraded Alcoa from Neutral to Buy, citing the company’s successful execution of profitability savings programs, the full realization of higher alumina prices, and an increased likelihood of debt paydown, which could ultimately lead to higher shareholder returns. Despite concerns about the sustainability of current alumina prices in the long term, B. Riley believes that Alcoa’s cash flow generation in the medium term will remain robust, bolstered by the timely acquisition of Alumina (OTC:AWCMY) Limited. The brokerage has revised its 2025 adjusted EBITDA estimate from $1,764 million to $2,412 million, translating to a 2025 FCFE of $983 million, or a 9% yield. Additionally, B. Riley has adjusted its fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA estimate from $413 million to $563 million. Buy at B. Riley means “We generally expect “Buy” rated stocks to have an above-average risk-adjusted total return over the next 12 months. We recommend that investors buy the securities at the current valuation. “ What happened? On Friday, UBS upgraded Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) to Buy with a $150 price target. *TLDR: UBS upgrades Datadog to Buy, citing improved spending and strong cloud growth prospects. UBS expects Datadog’s revenue growth to reach 25-30% in 2025-2026, despite premium valuation. What’s the full story? UBS has upgraded Datadog shares to a Buy from a Neutral, following the latest industry checks that indicate potential improvements in second-half spending and strong medium-term growth prospects for the AWS/Azure cloud infrastructure sector. The analysts believe these trends could help Datadog maintain or even modestly accelerate its mid-20% growth rate in the coming quarters. Despite Datadog shares trading at a premium—10 times the estimated 2026 revenues and 34 times the estimated 2026 free cash flow—UBS sees potential upside. This optimism is based on the expectation that revenue growth estimates for 2025 and 2026 could increase to the 25-30% range, up from the current 25-26%, with UBS estimates being approximately 200 basis points higher than consensus. Buy at UBS means “FSR is > 6% above the MRA” where FSR means Forecast Stock Return.

Title: Mastercard Incorporated (MA): Among the Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stands against the other stocks owned by hedge funds. Wall Street stocks surged this month after the Federal Reserve released minutes of its September meeting, which resulted in the first interest rate cuts in over four years. The details disclosed a ‘substantial majority’ of central bankers backing the 0.5 percentage-point cut, raising optimism among investors for further cuts ahead. The broader market hit record highs on October 11, driven by several financial stocks reporting stronger-than-expected results during the recently concluded quarter. Another factor encouraging investors has been the downturn in US inflation, which fell to 2.4% in September and is inching toward the Federal Reserve’s goal of a two percent annual rate. This has raised hopes of a quarter-point cut in the central bank’s next meeting in November. However, some analysts warn against diving into stocks after interest rate cuts, citing uncertainty around the upcoming presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider in early September discussed historic patterns in US markets towards the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth. She noted how the market performs well between June and August due to thinner volumes when traders are on vacation, while volatility picks up with an uptick in activity after they return to their desks in September. However, during the election year, this volatility peaks around mid-October, instead of September, according to Young Thomas. Fundstrat Global Advisors’ co-founder, Tom Lee, has also cautioned investors against election-related uncertainty. Here is what he stated in an interview with CNBC late last month: This Fed cut cycle I think is setting the stage for markets to be really strong over the next one month or next three months. But, what the stocks do between now and let’s say election day, I think is still a lot of uncertainty. And that’s the reason why I’m a little hesitant for investors to dive in. Earlier that month in the weeks leading to the interest rate cuts, Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, forecasted a 7-10% dip between September and October amid nervousness around the presidential elections. However, Lee urged investors to ‘buy the dip’, indicating that he sees the likely fall as an opportunity to buy stocks while they trade for a lower value. Adam Turnquist from LPL Financial also anticipates seasonal volatility in the weeks ahead but reiterated what Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes. Turnquist advises investors not to readjust their existing portfolios because seasonal volatility has short-term effects and is difficult to forecast. With that said, let’s now shift focus to hedge fund sentiment on the stock market and discuss some of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A woman using a payment terminal at the checkout of a store showing payment products and solutions. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 142 Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is an American payment card services company headquartered in Purchase, New York. It provides financial services to individual consumers, merchants, small and large businesses, and governments by facilitating electronic funds transfers. During the second quarter, the company delivered strong results with net revenues growing 13% to $6.96 billion. Adjusted net income stood at $3.3 billion, expanding 24% from last year, resulting in an EPS of $3.59 which comfortably beat estimates of $3.51 per share. CEO, Michael Miebach, credited the strong performance to healthy consumer spending and cross-border volume growth. Miebach said that the decline in inflation rates, wage growth, and a solid labor market drove increased consumer spending during the quarter. While price levels are still elevated for various key essentials, many central banks have started to ease their policies amid a reduction in interest rates. Cross-border volume climbed 17% which was attributed to an increase in travel demand. According to the United Nations, international tourism is on track to reach pre-pandemic levels this year, which bodes well for Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)’s future outlook. The company also signed several new travel partnerships in Q2. These included a co-brand agreement with Ethiopian Airlines, the largest airline in Africa, and multi-year contracts with Expedia and Wells Fargo to launch two new co-brand cards with a range of unique travel benefits. Switched transactions on Mastercard’s network increased 11% year-over-year in Q2, compared to 12% in Q1, reflecting some deceleration in growth. Despite that, consumer spending remains on solid ground and is on track for growth as international travel continues to rise. As a result, Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock and have a consensus on its Buy rating. Hedge fund sentiment also remains strong. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q2 2024, 142 hedge funds had investments in Mastercard, making it one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now. Overall MA ranks 10th on our list of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now. While we acknowledge the potential of MA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Disco Elysium 2 - Leaks, Rumors, & What's Confirmed (So Far)

Your changes have been saved Email is sent Email has already been sent Please verify your email address. You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics. Rumors of a Disco Elysium sequel, spinoff, or spiritual successor have been circulating since before the game was even released. The surreal, politically charged detective RPG met with near-universal acclaim at launch, going on to take home no fewer than four trophies at The Game Awards 2019, and three BAFTAs. With its humble beginnings as a tabletop system, Disco Elysium relies on traditional dice rolls to tell its groundbreaking, genre-defying story. It revolves around a dilapidated detective who drinks himself into a stupor so potent that he forgets the very nature of reality, waking up with a festering body and a murder to solve. Only shortly after its smash-hit success, the developers of Disco Elysium, an indie studio called ZA/UM, quietly began work on a spinoff. Unfortunately, internal conflict at the studio led to a series of legal troubles, ultimately ending in what may be the total dissolution of ZA/UM. That doesn't mean the legacy of Disco Elysium is dead, though - although the possibility of a sequel is next to nil, there's a good chance that there's more to come from its creators. The first whisper of a Disco Elysium 2 actually came from a Rock Paper Shotgun interview with its developers, published just twelve days before its release on October 15, 2019. It seemed that, even before Disco Elysium was out, ZA/UM was toying with ideas for a sequel. Writer Robert Kurvitz was particularly interested in putting players in the shoes of a pregnant protagonist, using the game's conversational skill system as an interface between mother and child. With the first Disco Elysium's musings on identity and the potential for change, this would've represented a generational evolution of its themes. The release was a success, and what followed was a whirlwind of lofty announcements: a console port, an expanded Director's Cut, even an Amazon streaming series. (The first two eventually materialized; the latter didn't.) For a time, though, there was no further word of a sequel. In 2022, ZA/UM appeared to be hiring developers for a sci-fi game, codenamed P1 and led by ZA/UM investor/Disco Elysium executive producer Kaur Kender. That October, however, it was revealed that Disco Elysium writer Robert Kurvitz was involved in a lawsuit filed against ZA/UM. Although details were scarce, the Estonian court filing did reveal that Kurvitz had requested access to unspecified documents. Shortly thereafter, representatives of ZA/UM announced that Kurvitz, fellow writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov had all been fired from the studio the year prio, citing misconduct. It alleged that they had created a toxic work environment, marked with verbal abuse and misogyny. In addition, ZA/UM stakeholder Ilmar Kompus claimed that Kurvitz had attempted to illicitly sell ZA/UM's intellectual property, but had failed to find a buyer. He claimed that P1 lead Kaur Kender had been responsible for demanding their dismissal, and had gone on leave. One of the best RPGs of 2024 is being swept under the rug and overshadowed by much bigger games, despite it easily being a GOTY contender. Rostov and Kurvitz later penned a post on Medium, in which they claimed that ZA/UM had been fraudulently sold to a company called Tütreke OÜ with Kender's aid. While these claims were never substantiated, it soon became clear that entertainment tycoon Margus Linnamäe had sold his shares in ZA/UM to two new stakeholders, Ilmar Kompus and Tõnis Haavel, the former of whom is registered as a beneficiary of Tütreke OÜ. Kender was next to file a lawsuit against Kompus and Haavel, this time for damages in the amount of €913,000 (roughly $991,883 USD). Kender claimed he and several other developers had been entitled to part of what they had paid Linnamäe for his share of the company, but that Linnamäe had gone over their heads. Kurvitz, Rostov, and Kender later withdrew their respective lawsuits in 2023. Kurvitz and Rostov cited a lack of evidence, while Kender admitted his own suit had been "misguided." It was revealed in 2023 that Kender had also been let go from ZA/UM after an extended period of leave. Then, in February 2024, an article in Sports Illustrated broke the news that ZA/UM was on its last legs, facing sweeping layoffs and the cancelation of a mystery project codenamed X7. This was said to be a standalone expansion for Disco Elysium, featuring writer Argo Tuulik, the last writer of the original game still employed at ZA/UM. Tuulik spoke with Sports Illustrated in a separate article the very next day, saying: "[ZA/UM] will forever stay a one-game studio. The individuals of ZA/UM, the cultural movement, have left the corporate body behind like the King Cobra slithering out of its dead skin. Remember, we promised: Un jour je serai de retour près de toi [one day I'll return to your side]. " That's shockingly final, but it's worth noting that there's never been any official confirmation that ZA/UM has shut down completely. A representative from ZA/UM responded to Tuulik's statement, saying only, "As with all studios, we adapt the size of our team to the work underway, growing when we start a new project and shrinking if one is cancelled. It is always hard to lose talented colleagues, and we thank those leaving for their many contributions to ZA/UM." The official ZA/UM X (formerly Twitter) account is still active as of October 2024, as is its website, which still has several job listings posted, including one posted as recently as October 10. There could indeed still be projects in development at ZA/UM, but it seems unlikely. And even if there are, there's no way of telling what those look like, or whether they have anything to do with Disco Elysium. It's not necessarily ethical, or even desirable, for a studio to can all the developers responsible for a successful game, then produce a sequel with a whole new team - but it's not exactly unheard of, either. Disco Elysium advanced video games as a legitimate storytelling medium, and it did so with the strength of its writing. ZA/UM has lost key talent. Then, on the morning of October 11, a new development studio named Longdue announced its existence in a press release, claiming to be developing a spiritual successor to Disco Elysium. It promised a "psychogeographic" RPG, which seems to imply an intersection between the player characters' inner dialogues and the world around them. Longdue claims that creatives from the original Disco Elysium and its canceled sequel (presumably X7) are somehow involved, but none have come forward at the time of writing. It is known that neither Kurvitz nor Rostov are involved in any of the three (yes, three) Disco Elysium successors announced on October 11. Later that day, another studio came out of the woodwork: Dark Math Games. With a teaser trailer, it claimed to have been founded by former ZA/UM devs, and to be working on a game called XXX Nightshift. Described as a "true detective" RPG - a phrase Disco Elysium also used in much of its marketing - XXX Nightshift stars Patrol Operative Dinorah Katz as one of many people stranded at a ski resort in Antarctica, in the near future of 2086. The three-minute teaser for the game, posted on YouTube the same day, shows a dialogue window strikingly similar to Disco Elysium's, complete with dice, and a system by which certain dialogue options are divided into red, green, and blue. Katz's alignment with these three colors may affect the results of her skill checks, as the "dice roll" graphic uses thos same three colors. Ample talk of chinchilla-fur blankets seems to imply a setting replete with luxury, which will likely be contrasted by gruesome crimes as the story unfolds. Finally, on the same day, a third studio, founded in part by Tuulik, appeared on the scene. In an extensive manifesto posted on its website, Summer Eternal announced that it intends to release a similarly genre-breaking game, but without all the drama. It has yet to announce any concrete plans, but claims it'll be launching a crowdfunding campaign in the coming days. Kurvitz and Rostov also appear to have founded their own studio, Red Info, Ltd., but nothing appears to have come out of it just yet. It's difficult to see the studio stripped for parts after such a wild and beloved success, but the lawsuits' withdrawal means that fans will probably never know exactly what happened internally before the DE team's dissolution. But while the future of ZA/UM is shaky at best, at least three studios have risen out of its ashes, and claim to have projects in the works. There may never be a second Disco Elysium game, but it's clear that the first has left its indelible mark on the industry, and will continue spawning imitators for a long time to come. Sources: Rock Paper Shotgun, Sports Illustrated (1), Medium, Sports Illustrated (2), ZA/UM/X, XXX Nightshift/YouTube, Summer Eternal Your comment has not been saved Disco Elysium is an open-world RPG that places a heavy emphasis on dialog and player choice. Players control Harrier "Harry" Du Bois, an amnesiac detective trying to piece together the shattered remnants of his past. The game received widespread praise from both players and critics alike, with many reviewers commenting on the quality of the game's writing. The Final Cut version of Disco Elysium is one of the highest-rated video games on Metacritic with a MetaScore of 97.

Despite having incredible gameplay and amazing reviews, one of the absolute best RPGs from 2024 has gone completely overlooked by everyone. Franchise veteran Patrick Dempsey confirms that he has been approached to return for Scream 7, and teases his potential return opposite Neve Campbell. Melissa Barrera's new anti-romance horror rom-com, Your Monster, receives a Fresh Rotten Tomatoes score as it heads into its opening weekend. Despite underwhelming animation, season 2 of Blue Lock adapts one of the manga's best arcs, resulting in a great story. Venom: The Last Dance features all kinds of Easter eggs and Marvel references amid all the crazy symbiote mayhem and Knull the Symbiote God. 20th Century Studios' president reveals there are three upcoming Agatha Christie adaptations in the works and shares which books they'll be tackling. Whether or not The New Batman Adventures is canonically part of Batman: The Animated Series has been a point of confusion since they aired.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Tech Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other promising tech stocks. Big tech is expected to outperform in the coming months. On October 2, Ari Wald, Oppenheimer's Head of Technical Analysis, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis and explain why investors must consider high-growth companies. Wald highlights that market breadth is expected to remain high supporting extended highs throughout the end of 2024. In addition to that, he expects the bull cycle to remain intact and believes the trend will continue in 2025. During the late summer, the market saw a change in the high beta versus low volatility ratio stocks. It was seen that high-beta stocks could not keep up with high dividend-paying and lower-volatility names. Given the rotational nature of the market, Wald expects higher beta names to make a strong comeback and reclaim their leadership position. Wald suggests that investors should consider investing in higher growth companies, as the Nasdaq and Russel 100 are expected to lead again. Trends show that the mag seven is growing and climbing, as the market conditions continue to settle. Technology stocks have more room to run. On October 14, Malcolm Ethridge, Capital Area Planning Group managing partner, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the technology market outlook and revealed his favorite picks. Ethridge suggests that judging stocks based on their valuations alone is a big mistake, especially in the current market cycle which is heavily influenced by the AI boom. Looking at the broader perspective, he believes there are a lot of positive opportunities among the magnificent seven and outside of it. He adds that companies among the mega tech have been pouring billions into generating large language models and the likes of it. He also suggests that most of this technology is yet to be understood and therefore the true value we can derive from these technologies is yet to come. These companies also have a lot of intrinsic value and there is more to be realized soon. Now that we have studied the technology market outlook, let's take a look at the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. You can also read our piece on the most promising AI stocks according to analysts. Our Methodology To come up with the most promising technology stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through multiple ETFs, our own rankings, and similar rankings on the internet. We then ranked the most promising tech stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Security personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69 CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity company that ranks 10th on our list of the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. The company provides a range of security products including identity management, threat intelligence, and threat detection. The company has 29,000 clients in multiple sectors including healthcare, retail, technology, and the government, reflecting its strong position in the market. Its AI native cybersecurity platform, Falcon is its primary product, growing at 80% year-over-year, in FQ2 2025. Despite the July 19 incident, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been resilient and showcased transparency and accountability to its customers. In the past 40 days, the company closed crucial partnerships, added innovations to its Falcon Platform, and expanded its CrowdStrike Marketplace to meet the growing demand for cybersecurity solutions. On August 29, Eric Heath, KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his stance on CRWD. He suggested that despite its global outage in July, the long-term opportunity CRWD offers remains intact. He also added that the company is taking corrective action to avoid such incidents in the future and suggested the company has grown since the incident and will continue to do so. As our reliance on software increases so does the need for cybersecurity, which makes CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) an important stakeholder now and in the coming years. That said, according to our Insider Monkey database, 69 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the close of Q2 2024. Overall CRWD ranks 10th on our list of the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
