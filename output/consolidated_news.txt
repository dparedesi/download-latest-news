BySusie Violet Ward BySusie Violet Ward Contributor. LONDON, ENGLAND - MAY 29: People pass through the Bank area of the City of London on May 29, 2024 in ... More London, England. In recent months, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has reportedly met with the boss of Shein, the Chinese-founded fashion retailer, to encourage the company to launch its initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. London's reputation as a global financial hub has suffered in the wake of Brexit, compounded by an industry-wide slowdown in public offerings due to high interest rates and economic uncertainty. Photo by Carl Court The UK has a proud history of excellence and innovation in both financial services and in computer science. But its regulatory approach to bitcoin, which sits at the intersection between these disciplines, is undermining that position. The Financial Conduct Authority has created uncertainty, driven businesses offshore, and is damaging the UK’s competitiveness in digital finance. Regulatory uncertainty, restrictive policies, and a risk-averse approach have put the UK at a disadvantage as institutions elsewhere move forward. While other jurisdictions recognize Bitcoin’s role in institutional finance, UK regulators have created an environment that stifles progress. The Bitcoin for Institutions event, held recently in London at The Law Society, brought together investors, policymakers, and industry leaders to assess bitcoin’s growing significance. The consensus? The rest of the world is advancing while the UK remains stuck in bureaucratic inaction. Bitcoin for Institutions at The Law Society. Allen Farrington, co-founder of Axiom, a bitcoin-native investment firm focused on capital deployment in the bitcoin economy, captured the shift in institutional thinking. He described bitcoin as “forming the basis of a viable institutional asset class.” However, despite bitcoin being the best-performing asset of the decade, UK institutions remain hesitant. The FCA, tasked with ensuring financial stability, has instead become a barrier to innovation, and the result is that businesses have been driven out of the UK, driven out by regulatory hostility or simply deciding that the cost of compliance with poorly thought-out regulation is too high. While the UK stalls, the U.S. moves fast. One message was repeated throughout the event. Ignoring bitcoin is now seen as a career risk. https://x.com/Blockstream/status/1903109220393750840 In the U.S., pension funds, corporate treasuries, and asset managers are integrating bitcoin into their portfolios. In recent months, the largest buyers of bitcoin have not been retail investors or hedge funds, but institutional funds. Andrew Hohns, founder and CEO of Newmarket Investment Management, described the contrast, “Many U.S. companies have started incorporating bitcoin into their financial planning, and many others are well down the road. In the UK, institutional awareness of the benefits of bitcoin is more nascent, but the topic will move closer to center stage as corporate and sovereign game theory quickly take hold." Dominic Frisby summed up the cost of inaction: "Given the potential of bitcoin, and its record, the risk is not so much owning bitcoin as not owning it." In dialogue with Izabella Kaminska, Steve Baker, who served as Minister of State in the Cabinet Office until July 2024, commented on U.S. policymakers’ proactive stance, stating, “It’s great that the US is governed by a group of people who understand this.” In contrast, jurisdictions like the U.S., UAE, and Singapore are attracting capital by implementing frameworks that distinguish between bitcoin and speculative cryptoassets. The FCA has created a framework that treats bitcoin the same as speculative crypto tokens, ignoring its distinct characteristics as a decentralized monetary network. Adrian Cannon from Musqet pointed out this fundamental mismatch, "Bitcoin is revolutionary in ideas and concepts and that doesn’t fit within regulation and banking." Beyond the FCA’s misclassification of bitcoin, the UK’s broader regulatory structure is also a barrier to institutional adoption. Baroness Claire Fox, who sits in the House of Lords, told the audience about a recent government initiative called the Regulatory Innovation Office, which was implemented with the intention of reining in regulators. However, the reality is a system of self-replicating bureaucracy, as she described a quango of regulators where no one has accountability. This structure discourages innovation, shields regulators from scrutiny, and blocks new market entrants, creating a system that protects incumbents while deterring progress. While regulators insist their approach is about protecting investors, the reality is that businesses are being forced offshore, limiting choice and harming competitiveness. Beyond regulatory concerns, institutional adoption has also been slowed by misconceptions about bitcoin’s environmental impact. Discussions at the event highlighted how bitcoin is being used to stabilize energy grids, reduce waste, and improve sustainability. One panel on social benefits discussed bitcoin’s growing role in advancing financial inclusion and human rights - and the fintech products being built to enable this. In regions affected by financial repression, bitcoin is being used to bypass restrictions, support activist movements, and provide stable value transfer in fragile economies. In areas with poor access to banking, whether in sub-Saharan Africa, Afghanistan, or refugee communities, bitcoin offers a way to receive donations, store value, and operate independently from centralised financial institutions. LONDON, ENGLAND - MAY 30: In this photo illustration, a visual representation of Bitcoin in London, ... More England. Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency, which has been in use since 2009. Photo illustration by Edward Smith Recent data indicates that over 50% of bitcoin mining is now powered by renewable energy sources. Miners are increasingly co-locating with wind, solar, and hydro projects, acting as flexible demand-response partners and absorbing excess energy when supply outpaces demand and powering down during peak consumption to relieve pressure on the grid. In the UK, this model could deliver substantial savings, especially given that electricity prices here are among the highest in the world. Reducing energy costs could offer a vital boost to both households and businesses facing mounting bills. According to the National Grid ESO, curtailment of wind power alone cost British consumers over £800 million in 2023, as renewable generators were paid to shut down during periods of oversupply, with the tab being picked up by households. If this curtailed energy were redirected to bitcoin mining, an approach already implemented in parts of the U.S., Scandinavia, and Africa, it would reduce these costs and provide an additional revenue stream for renewable operators. Instead of paying producers to switch off, excess energy could be monetised in real-time, and customers would see immediate savings on their bills. Bitcoin mining is also being used to capture vented methane from oil fields and repurpose landfill gas into electricity, turning environmental liabilities into economic opportunities. These developments challenge legacy thinking and position bitcoin as an energy solution. The discussion repeatedly returned to one key issue, namely that the UK is falling behind. While British firms continue debating whether bitcoin should be included in institutional portfolios, U.S. asset managers and corporate treasurers are already executing their bitcoin strategies. Dominic Frisby captured the financial risk of inaction, "The risk is not owning it." At the same time, institutional investors in the U.S. and elsewhere are increasing their exposure. In recent months, institutional funds have been the largest single buyer of bitcoin. This shift was largely due to BlackRock and Fidelity launching U.S.-approved bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, an institutional milestone that the UK has yet to match. What’s more, President Donald Trump signed an executive order in early March 2025 to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, positioning bitcoin as a strategic asset within the U.S. financial system. ​ The tension between legacy finance and emerging alternatives was clear throughout the event, which was described as a clash between Wall Street and Main Street. The real risk for the UK is not that bitcoin will fail but that it will succeed elsewhere and leave the UK institutions scrambling to catch up. If the UK wants to remain a serious player in global finance, it needs to adapt before the next wave of innovation settles elsewhere. Baroness Claire Fox offered a blunt assessment of the current state of affairs and the path to change, “Rebellion is the way forward.” The Bitcoin for Institutions event clearly demonstrated an unavoidable truth: that UK institutions must act. Regulatory paralysis is not stopping bitcoin’s adoption. It is simply pushing progress elsewhere. While the U.S., UAE, and Singapore create supportive policies, the UK remains locked in bureaucratic complexity. Without a course correction, UK financial firms will be left behind in the next phase of institutional finance. Bitcoin is no longer an emerging trend, it is a financial transformation already in motion. And transformations do not wait for governments and regulators to catch up. This event was held under Chatham House Rule. All participants quoted in this article gave permission for their remarks to be used.

Title: Four in five workers in Ireland not aware of State’s auto-enrolment pension details
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/03/31/four-in-five-workers-in-ireland-not-aware-of-states-auto-enrolment-pension-details/

Four in five Irish workers are still not aware of the details of the incoming compulsory workplace pension regime just six months out from the launch date, according to a survey carried out by US investment giant BlackRock. BlackRock is understood to be among asset managers lining up a bid to manage part of the so-called auto-enrolment pension pot. The scheme will capture up to 800,000 workers between the ages of 23 and 60 and earning more than €20,000 who are not currently part of a pension plan, at the end of September. BlackRock’s 2025 Ireland Read on Retirement report also said that only 41 per cent of Irish workers feel they are on track for a reasonable standard of living on retirement. This falls to 26 per cent across individuals that do not have a defined contribution (DC) workplace pension. “As we approach the introduction of auto-enrolment in the Republic of Ireland it is crucial that we address the gaps in awareness and understanding to ensure that all workers can benefit from this pivotal step forward,” said Tim Hodgson, of BlackRock’s UK & Ireland DC Platforms and Retirement Solutions. “Irish workers face similar challenges to those encountered by retirement savers around the world. The introduction of auto-enrolment later this year is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to help individuals set themselves up for a comfortable retirement.” The Department of Social Protection launched a long-delayed official search for three companies to manage the investment of contributions that will be made by employers, employees and the State into the auto-enrolment pot. Each will have to provide fund options of low, medium and high risk. Investment managers interested in the business have until April 7th to pitch for it. BlackRock is expected to compete alongside Amundi, Irish Life’s investment management arm, State Street Global Advisors and others for one of the three contracts. The “request for tender” document says that there may be €21 billion in assets under management in the My Future Fund – the name given to the auto-enrolment scheme – within 10 years. The document, filed on the Government’s eTenders website, sets a cap on any all-inclusive annual management charge of 0.1 per cent of the assets under management. Under auto-enrolment employers and employees will both contribute 1.5 per cent of their gross earnings to it initially, with the State adding a further 0.5 per cent. The contributions of all parties will gradually increase, reaching 6 per cent and 2 per cent respectively by 2034. The BlackRock survey results reflect an international trend of poor retirement readiness. BlackRock’s UK Read on Retirement published in 2024 found that nearly three-quarters of UK DC pension savers feel they are not on track to achieve a reasonable standard of living in retirement while 60 per cent of workers who participated in a US study said they feared outliving their retirement savings.

Title: AI's "Biggest Test" Is Turning Into a Catastrophe as CoreWeave Flounders
URL: https://futurism.com/ai-test-coreweave
Time Published: 2025-03-31T00:48:52Z
Full Content:
So far, the AI industry has enjoyed smooth sailing. It's courted billions in slap-happy investments and sign-first, read-later contracts, ballooning some Silicon Valley companies to the top of the financial food chain. Now it's facing its toughest challenge yet in the form of CoreWeave, the AI processing company that went public on the stock market this week and the first all-AI startup to do so. It was said to be a major test for the industry — and so far it's failing, miserably. CoreWeave stocks hit the public market with a wet thud on Friday, opening at $39, down slightly from its IPO price of $40 per share, which was already reduced from the highest projection of $55 per share the previous week. The company's hopes of raising $4 billion in the offering thus fell way short at a soggy $1.5 billion. That flat opening helped spurn a rough day for the Magnificent 7 — the term used to describe Google, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft — which all tumbled following announcements of Donald Trump's auto tariffs. Nvidia, the chip giant that's tried to prop up CoreWeave, saw its stock price fall 1.5 percent on Friday, after a 2.1 percent fall on Thursday. Apple, meanwhile, fell 2.5 percent, while Amazon tumbled 4.5 percent, and Tesla dived 3.7 ahead of worldwide protests aimed at CEO Elon Musk. Though CoreWeave isn't entirely to blame for the M7's terrible rotten day, its failure to instill faith in the tech industry and stave off mounting losses still feels like a big deal. The company's entire business model hinges on the mass adoption of generative AI — a resource-intensive technology whose main impact so far has been polluting the internet with computer generated slop. If CoreWeave does well, it would be a major boost for the tech industry, kicking off even more demand for chips and a wave of AI IPOs. However, if CoreWeave can't survive despite the massive contracts it has with Microsoft, OpenAI, and Nvidia, then investors will have little reason to trust the generative AI hype going forward — something many have questioned after the Chinese AI company DeepSeek suggested a sustainable alternative to US AI development. And unfortunately for American AI hopefuls, there's little reason to think CoreWeave can hold out the next six months, let alone lead the AI revolution. As tech critic Ed Zitron notes, CoreWeave is a company primed for disaster. Its business is far from stable, relying on those huge revenue injections over sustainable, diversified income. According to the company's financial filings, 77 percent of CoreWeave's revenue comes from just two customers — meaning the company could collapse like a house of cards if just one of its clients cancels a contract. Meanwhile, it has what Zitron calls a "fatal amount of debt" via loans from companies like Blackstone and Magnetar. The interest alone on CoreWeave's top two loans could be as much as $1.5 billion per year thanks to some high-risk terms, suggesting a lack of faith from the company's lenders. All told, it's a pretty lame showing given all the hype we've heard from AI tycoons. The next few months will tell whether they can keep CoreWeave — and the AI industry — afloat as the market grows impatient with empty promises.

Title: Sustainable investing the new standard
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/investment/2991619/sustainable-investing-the-new-standard
Time Published: 2025-03-30T23:15:00Z

ESG investing is more than just a trend -- many expect it to become the new standard. The strategy is considered sustainable, measuring environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors to judge an investment's financial returns and impact. Environmental factors can include carbon emissions, waste management and sustainability efforts. Social factors involve employee treatment, workplace diversity and community relations. Governance factors value leadership decisions, transparency and business ethics. With growing investor interest and regulatory support, ESG investing is becoming a mainstream approach to building sustainable and profitable portfolios. Research suggests ESG-focused investments often outperform traditional ones, offering competitive returns with less risk. At the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), ESG investment is being prioritised and support is provided to listed companies to align with international ESG standards. Many Thai listed companies received global ESG scores and emerged as industry leaders, recognised by S&P Global's Sustainability Yearbook 2025, which evaluates and awards companies for outperforming their peers in sustainability. GROWING POPULARITY Global ESG fund investments have been increasing, with assets under management now exceeding US$40 trillion, according to Bloomberg. Reports from Morningstar and MSCI indicate ESG funds tend to outperform conventional funds in the long term. During the pandemic, global ESG funds recovered more quickly than the overall market. Research from Harvard Business Review suggests ESG stocks exhibit lower volatility and offer stable returns during market downturns. Sustainable businesses are more likely to survive and grow in the long term due to improved risk management in ESG aspects, according to these reports. Governments are introducing regulations on net-zero policies, carbon taxes and ESG standards, affecting companies that fail to adapt. Companies reliant on fossil fuels or lacking ESG policies may face rising costs due to fines, environmental fees, and higher energy costs. Institutional investors such as BlackRock, Vanguard and Norges Bank emphasise ESG criteria and require companies they invest in to uphold clear sustainability standards. Recognising this trend, the SET supports Thai listed companies in enhancing sustainability. Soraphol Tulayasathien, senior executive vice-president and head of sustainable market development at the SET, said the bourse is driving ESG adoption among listed companies through various initiatives, including the development of the SET ESG Ratings and SET ESG Index. The SET utilises its ESG Ratings to compile the SET ESG Index, which has been published on the SET's website since Nov 6, 2023. The SET ESG Ratings are based on a voluntary sustainability assessment that evaluates companies across ESG dimensions. The assessment is reviewed annually to align with evolving sustainability trends at both global and national levels. To be included in the SET ESG Ratings, listed companies must score at least 50% in each ESG dimension and meet specific criteria, such as corporate governance reporting (CGR) quality, net profit performance, shareholder equity, and adherence to ESG-related compliance standards. Any companies failing to meet these criteria are excluded from the ratings. ESG IN THAILAND More than 100 Thai ESG funds manage some 30 billion baht in assets. Chavinda Hanratanakool, chairwoman of the Association of Investment Management Companies, said firms are encountering greater risks across the global business landscape. "ESG information will be an important tool investors should use to make investment decisions," she said. "Companies that take into account ESG issues can see their business risks reduced, while investors are also focusing on managing their risks." To serve the growing popularity of ESG investments and to prop up a struggling bourse, the government endorsed the Thai ESG Extra (ESG X) fund category last month, designed to encourage investment in sustainable and high-growth equities through substantial tax incentives. Investors can transfer existing holdings from long-term equity funds maturing this year, estimated at 180 billion baht, to Thai ESG X funds to qualify for a tax deduction of up to 500,000 baht. Investors can claim 300,000 baht in the 2025 tax year, with the remaining 200,000 baht available for deduction in subsequent years at 50,000 baht a year. New investments in Thai ESG X funds are also eligible for a separate tax deduction of 300,000 baht in the 2025 tax year, provided the units are purchased between May and June. The SET listed 242 stocks for inclusion in Thai ESG and Thai ESG X funds, consisting of 228 companies with SET ESG Ratings and 14 companies disclosing greenhouse gas emissions data. Whether other stocks can be included depends on the individual fund policies. The bourse announced Thai ESG X funds must invest at least 65% of net asset value in securities listed on the SET or Market for Alternative Investment that meet one of the three following sustainability criteria. First, securities that have a good SET ESG Rating or international ESG rating, such as from the FTSE Index or MSCI Index. Second, companies that disclosed greenhouse gas emissions data, and third companies that have a CGR score from the Thai Institute of Directors of at least 90 and disclosed data on at least 85% of their items on the SET ESG data platform. RATINGS BENEFITS Mr Soraphol said an ESG rating serves as a tool for improving sustainable business practices and risk management. Companies receive scores and recommendations in order to enhance their ESG performance, he said. ESG scores allow companies to compare their sustainability performance against peers, while companies gain visibility among sustainable investors, facilitating better access to capital, said Mr Soraphol. "An ESG credit rating benefits investors and analysts, providing a benchmark for comparing companies' ESG performance," he said. For analysts, the rating supports stock valuation and investment decision-making. In addition, the rating helps fund managers develop ESG-focused investment products, said Mr Soraphol. The rating also serves as a tool for investor engagement and corporate ESG advocacy, he said. In 2024, 228 listed companies clinched a spot on the SET ESG Ratings, echoing the growing wave of sustainable investments locally and globally. There are 242 listed companies on the list. GLOBAL LEADERSHIP S&P Global recently launched the Sustainability Yearbook 2025 to recognise top-performing companies in sustainability. The assessment is based on the 2024 S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA), which evaluated 7,690 companies on economic and ESG factors. S&P global CSA scores range from 0 to 100 and categorise companies into the top 1%, top 5%, and top 10% globally: The top 1% comprises companies with the highest CSA scores worldwide. The top 5% covers companies ranking just below the top 1%. The top 10% comprises the highest-ranked 10% of companies in each industry. Beyond ESG stocks, investment themes such as climate change, green bonds and carbon credits are gaining traction. The SET partnered with the London Stock Exchange Group through FTSE Russell to enhance ESG assessments in Thailand, aligning SET ESG Ratings with global standards. The assessment methodology, which is used for more than 8,000 securities worldwide, ensures Thai listed firms can be benchmarked against global peers, strengthening investor confidence. A pilot assessment is planned for 2024-2025, with full public ESG score disclosure by 2026. NET-ZERO COMMITMENTS As the SET enters its 50th year, the bourse is driving sustainable capital market development and aiming for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As part of these efforts, it is developing the SET Carbon system to disclose climate change management data about the capital market, aiming to enhance climate data disclosure and streamline corporate greenhouse gas emissions reporting. The first phase of SET Carbon is available to interested companies in the first quarter of this year. In collaboration with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, the bourse is also integrating listed companies' energy consumption data. The SET recently obtained validation for its net-zero targets from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an internationally recognised authority on science-based target setting. The validated targets include a 42% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and a 90% reduction by 2050. With this distinction, the bourse becomes the fourth stock exchange worldwide to secure SBTi validation for both near-term and long-term net-zero targets, alongside Bursa Malaysia, the Nasdaq and Deutsche Börse Group. "ESG investing is more than just an option, it is the new global investment standard," said Mr Soraphol. Investors prioritising ESG will unlock superior opportunities, while companies committed to sustainability will attract greater investor attention and achieve long-term growth potential, he said.

Crypto users are backing a spot XRP ETF approval on Polymarket as odds soar past 85%. Anticipation for altcoin ETFs has dominated the market since Donald Trump’s election victory in November 2024. With US regulatory waters easing, most users have called for possible XRP, SOL, and ADA spot ETFs. On March 24, the odds for a spot XRP ETF in the United States soared past 85% on Polymarket. The prediction platform recently gained traction regarding U.S. policies, including the last Presidential election. Users expect the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to give applications the regulatory nod this year following recent events in the market. This became a major morale boost for traders due to the high chances of Polymarket predictions. A previous Dune Analytics study showed that the betting market had a 90% success rate. At press time, the prediction volume has soared past $55,000, while 42% of users back an earlier approval date of July 31. Similarly, digital asset enthusiast Nate Geraci wrote on X that a spot XRP ETF approval is just a matter of time, citing participation from BlackRock, Fidelity, and other firms. He added that the asset is the third largest by market cap, hinting that these top firms would not miss out on it. Several crypto users have toed the same line, stressing that the asset’s market cap and institutional demand place it next in line for approval. In Q4 2024, XRP flipped USDT to become the third-largest asset by market cap after it soared above $3. Institutional investors also increased their exposure to the asset following global partnerships coupled with its cross-border functionalities. At the time of writing, XRP gained 0.5% to trade at $2.14 in the past few hours. Aside from wider institutional adoption, the present regulatory environment in the United States has triggered a new wave of optimism. Last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that the SEC would drop its appeal against the firm after years of litigation. For most commentators, the Ripple v SEC lawsuit remained a setback for the firm in terms of institutional demand. Furthermore, the launch of a strategic crypto reserve in the United States and growing acceptance from traditional firms have heightened investor appetite.

Title: Shiba Inu Insider Explains Why SHIB Is Ready For Multi-Billion-Dollar Inflows From ‘SHIB ETFs’

The debate over whether Shiba Inu (SHIB) is ready for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) continues to gain traction in the crypto space. Despite ranking as the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and boasting over 110 exchange listings with 212 trading pairs, SHIB has yet to receive a proposed ETF in the United States. However, its community remains steadfast in pushing for recognition. On Sunday, Lucie, the lead marketing strategist for Shiba Inu, took to X to highlight SHIB’s readiness for an ETF and why even boomers could embrace the popular meme token. “SHIB is listed on over 110 exchanges with 212 trading pairs—including all the major platforms. It’s basically everywhere: easy to access, easy to trade. Is SHIB good for an ETF? YES. Will boomers invest in a ‘doggy coin’? Also yes,” Lucie asserted. She emphasized that SHIB is more than just a meme; it is a decentralized, community-driven asset built to last. One of the strongest arguments for a SHIB ETF is its resistance to price manipulation. The pundit pointed out that to manipulate SHIB, one would need to be a billionaire, similar to Bitcoin. This characteristic differentiates SHIB from low-cap tokens susceptible to extreme price swings. Additionally, she highlighted SHIB’s decentralization as a critical factor in its ETF potential. Unlike projects that rely on central entities, SHIB continues to grow organically, with various teams building around it. She referenced Shiba Inu’s ecosystem, including the core development team, Shibarium’s Layer-2 blockchain, and the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange, as key innovations that bolster SHIB’s long-term sustainability. This is not the first time the Shiba Inu community has advocated for an ETF. In January 2025, Shibizens, a prominent SHIB community handle, published a detailed case for why major asset managers like BlackRock and Grayscale should consider launching a SHIB ETF. Their argument rested on ten key points, including SHIB’s massive global community, high liquidity, and operational success of Shibarium. The post quickly gained traction, with community members rallying behind the idea. Users voiced strong support and predicted a price surge for SHIB ecosystem tokens, such as BONE, SHIB, and LEASH. Shibizens also highlighted SHIB’s affordability, ESG-friendly initiatives through the Shib Karma Foundation, and potential for long-term institutional adoption. One of Lucie’s more interesting claims was that boomers could warm up to SHIB. While traditionally wary of volatile assets, older investors could find SHIB appealing due to its accessibility, decentralization, and expanding role in DeFi, gaming, and payments. Additionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently clarified on February 27, 2025, that most meme coins do not qualify as securities under federal law. This shift strengthens SHIB’s prospects for an ETF, potentially making it easier for older investors to enter the meme coin market.

Title: Elon Musk’s X and xAI ‘Intertwined’ in $45 Billion Deal

Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence (AI) company has acquired his social media platform in a multibillion-dollar deal. The deal, announced by Musk Friday (March 28), values his xAI at $80 billion and X, the social media platform once known as Twitter, at $33 billion ($45 billion minus $12 billion in debt). “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined,” Musk wrote in a post on the social media site. “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach.” According to Musk, X now has 600 million active users. Data from those users has been used to train Grok, xAI’s artificial intelligence model. And premium subscribers to X can access some of Grok’s higher-end features. The news follows reports from last month that X was in talks to raise funds from investors at a $44 billion valuation, the same figure Musk paid for the platform in 2022. An investor in X told the Financial Times (FT) that getting back to the original purchase price has been a symbolic target for Musk. As that report noted, Musk loosened X’s moderation policies after taking over. That prompted an advertiser exodus, driving down revenues. Fidelity Investments, the report points out, has slashed the company’s value, saying in late September it was under $10 billion. However, many advertisers have returned, with Amazon recently increasing its spending as Musk forged stronger ties with the White House. Investors told the FT that X’s finances seem to be improving, with the company having posted $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization last year. That figure aligns more or less with the time just before Musk acquired Twitter, the report added, though one source said the number was subject to “significant adjustments.” Meanwhile, xAI and chipmaker Nvidia recently joined the $30 billion AI Infrastructure Fund, an AI infrastructure project backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and Abu Dhabi AI investment group MGX, with the goal of raising up to $100 billion for the technology. “The global buildout of AI infrastructure will benefit every company and country that wants to achieve economic growth and unlock solutions to the world’s greatest challenges,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in the announcement. “AI factories built on Nvidia full-stack AI infrastructure will convert data into intelligence that will accelerate every industry and help society achieve unimaginable breakthroughs.” Elon Musk's X and xAI 'Intertwined' in $45 Billion Deal Frank Founder Charlie Javice Convicted of $175 Million Fraud Experience Economy Meets Hollywood: Live Events Redefine Movie, Streaming Engagement Lululemon Offers New Products and Events to Draw ‘Cautious Consumer’ We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Cork Con seal their place as Division 1A play-off contenders with win over Ballynahinch

The make-up of the Division 1A play-off contenders has been decided with a round to spare after results contrived to ensure St Mary’s, Clontarf, Cork Constitution and Lansdowne will contest the semi-finals. Cork Con sealed their place thanks to a 28-5 win in a tough, hard encounter at Ballynahinch which ended the home side’s play-off hopes. Con had first use of a swirling wind and led 14-5 at half time thanks to tries by lock Eoin Quilter and tight head Luke Masters. Entering the final quarter, scrumhalf Adam Maher rewarded sustained pressure, and a try five minutes from time by the Ireland Clubs captain Jack Kelleher sealed a bonus point. That also sealed a play-off place ahead of next Saturday’s concluding game at home to Terenure, who suffered a fourth defeat in a row at home by 20-12 to Young Munster. A try by Evan O’Connell gave “Munsters” a 7-5 lead at half time after playing into the wind, and two second half-tries by another Munster player, Shay McCarthy, secured the win. St Mary’s ensured their semi-final place with a 40-12 win at home to City of Armagh and unexpectedly went top by dint of Garryowen’s gritty 19-18 win at home to Clontarf. Gordon Wood scored tries in either half as the Light Blues recovered from a 13-7 deficit to win through a Mikey Veale try converted by Dylan Hicks. Despite this Garryowen’s relegation was mathematically confirmed. Clontarf now need to beat St Mary’s at home next Saturday to ensure a home semi-final or else they could be overtaken by Cork Con. UCD remain two points adrift of City of Armagh in the relegation play-off place after their 25-7 loss at home to in-form Lansdowne, and have the tougher last game away to Young Munster, whereas Armagh host Ballynahinch. Nenagh Ormond sealed a home semi-final in the 1B play-offs with 21-17 win over third-placed Blackrock, who next host fourth-placed Old Wesley, while UCC could overtake the losers at home to champions Old Belvedere. Shannon’s 1B status hangs by a thread after their 34-5 loss to Old Wesley. The nine-time champions sit tenth and last, and trail Highfield and Trinity by five points ahead of next Saturday’s last round when Shannon host Queen’s, Highfield go to Naas and Trinity entertain Nenagh. Greystones overtook Corinthians on points difference in the final 2A play-off place by dint of beating the Galway side 45-15 at home. Wanderers secured the 2B title and promotion with a 42-7 home win over Clogher Valley, while Midleton will take a two-point lead into the final round ahead of Enniscorthy atop 2C.

Title: Ireland secure record-breaking eight-try victory over Italy
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/03/30/ireland-secure-record-breaking-eight-try-victory-over-italy/

A superb win and a great performance underscored by eight tries, there was plenty to celebrate for Scott Bemand’s team as they bounced back from their opening day defeat to France with an impressive victory in Parma. Ireland’s Aoife Dalton was a deserved player of the match, not only a try scorer, but also consistently excellent on both sides of the ball, making 15 tackles and nine carries. Although Ireland’s right wing Anna McGann might feel it’s not often that a hat-trick of tries is overlooked in handing out the laurels. There were others too that stood out. Stacey Flood added value every time she touched the ball, Eve Higgins had an eye for a gap, and outhalf Dannah O’Brien’s kicked brilliantly out of hand and off the tee, from which she landed seven from eight conversions. Up front the pack were excellent to a player, Aoife Wafer, Erin King and Linda Djougang especially prominent. Italy got off to the worst possible start as they lost their secondrow Valeria Fedrighi to a yellow card for a shoulder to the head of Ireland captain Edel McMahon after less than a minute. The subsequent bunker review adjudicated it should remain a yellow, but by the time she returned the home side had conceded 14 points. O’Brien kicked the penalty to touch. Ireland mauled the ball and after a couple of carries from the pack, pursued a wider option. Despite the fact that Higgins had her pass deflected, Dalton scooped up the ball and demonstrated speed and strength to force her way over. O’Brien’s conversion was unerring. It got even better for Ireland on seven minutes when Higgins deceived the defence with a dummy and accelerated through a gap. Both the timing and accuracy of her pass enabled Anna McGann to cross for her first try in Test rugby. The work of the Irish backrow at the breakdown was first class in the opening quarter, Wafer and King especially prominent, so too hooker Neve Jones. The Italians had served notice with some enterprising back play before scrumhalf Sofia Stefan profited from soft Irish defence to scamper over for a try. Ireland’s determination to drift without closing the space inside was costly. The visitors then dodged one or two more defensive lapses without conceding further points before Higgins, once again, cut the Italian defence asunder. Amee-Leigh Costigan still had work to do but accomplished it with a lovely in-and-out swerve to cross for Ireland’s third try. The fourth and bonus-point try was a brilliant team effort. Wafer and Djougang were direct and powerful to guarantee front foot possession, before fullback Stacey Flood glided on to the ball, straightened, and gave McGann the space to squeeze over in the corner for her second try. O’Brien kicked a superb touchline conversion, her fourth from as many attempts. A gutsy goal-line stand in the final moments of the half enabled Ireland to take a 28-5 interval lead. Wafer had a try disallowed soon after the restart Niamh O’Dowd pinged for blocking. Britanny Hogan and Dorothy Wall made an immediate impression off the bench, their energy and power conspicuous in the build-up to a deserved try for the hard-working Djougang. Unfortunately for the Irish tighthead prop her next involvement resulted in a yellow card, which stayed at that level of censure on review. It meant that Christy Haney had to come on for flanker McMahon. Hogan and Wall collaborated for Ireland’s sixth try on 64-minutes, the latter powering over from close range. O’Brien failed to convert for the first time. Italian centre Beatrice Rigoni was awarded a try after a TMO review, a strange decision on the basis that she didn’t get to her feet before playing the ball for a second time. Her right knee remained on the ground/back of the Irish player. She maximised her good fortune by adding the conversion, but it was merely window dressing in scoreboard terms. Given a glut of changes on both sides the contest lost a little of its shape as the teams struggled to maintain cohesion. Replacement scrumhalf Emily Lane might have added to Ireland’s tally, but lost control of the ball just shy of the Italian line following a sharp break. The visitors did get that seventh try, Hogan barging past a couple of lacklustre tackles, which O’Brien improved upon and with the last play of the match McGann grabbed her hat-trick, outflanking and outpacing the Italian defence. O’Brien’s conversion a fitting epitaph for a stellar placekicking display.

Title: How Performative Activism Enabled Mass Persecution

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/30/2025 9:23:17 AM PDT by MtnClimber Reality engineering requires three components: institutional power to create the narrative, social pressure to enforce it, and the deliberate persecution of anyone who challenges either. The Covid era provided the perfect case study in how this machinery operates—and revealed how performative activism serves as its most potent enforcement mechanism. Every major element of the official Covid narrative has been proven false: The origins of the virus, the validity of PCR tests, the suppression of early treatments, the denial of natural immunity, the so-called “safety and effectiveness” of vaccines, and the utility of masks, lockdowns, and vaccine passports. Yet those who questioned any part of it faced unprecedented ostracism and persecution. The manufactured panic ignored fundamental reality: Covid posed minimal risk to healthy people under 70, but was significantly more dangerous to the elderly and immunocompromised. Rather than focusing resources on protecting vulnerable populations, we destroyed economies, stole childhoods, and enforced measures that made no epidemiological sense. This wasn’t just about control—it was an engineered economic coup, the largest financial consolidation of power in modern history. While small businesses were forcibly closed, Amazon’s profits soared. As working-class neighborhoods struggled, Wall Street celebrated record gains. The laptop class posted about ‘we’re all in this together’ from their home offices while essential workers were forced into what was portrayed as dangerous conditions to deliver their groceries. The same corporations trumpeting their commitment to “equity” through DEI initiatives were destroying economic mobility for the very communities they claimed to champion. Just months before Covid, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY. An examination of the event reveals that the priority of the exercise centered not on treatment protocols or protecting the vulnerable but rather on how information control could be used to manufacture mass compliance. When the real crisis arrived, this strategy found willing accomplices in a culture already primed for performative virtue. The height of this hypocrisy revealed itself during the pandemic, exposing not just empty virtue signaling, but active participation in one of the most egregious civil rights violations in recent American history. As millions changed their profile pictures and posted solidarity symbols for social justice, these same voices fell silent—or worse, actively participated in the persecution of two distinct groups: the unvaccinated and the vaccine-injured. The Profitable Performance of PowerThe economic devastation fell hardest on those least able to bear it. While professionals attended Zoom meetings in their pajamas, service workers faced an impossible choice: show up to what was marketed as a deadly environment or lose their livelihoods.

Rather than focusing resources on protecting vulnerable populations, we destroyed economies, stole childhoods, and enforced measures that made no epidemiological sense. This wasn’t just about control—it was an engineered economic coup, the largest financial consolidation of power in modern history. While small businesses were forcibly closed, Amazon’s profits soared. As working-class neighborhoods struggled, Wall Street celebrated record gains. The laptop class posted about ‘we’re all in this together’ from their home offices while essential workers were forced into what was portrayed as dangerous conditions to deliver their groceries. The same corporations trumpeting their commitment to “equity” through DEI initiatives were destroying economic mobility for the very communities they claimed to champion. Just months before Covid, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY. An examination of the event reveals that the priority of the exercise centered not on treatment protocols or protecting the vulnerable but rather on how information control could be used to manufacture mass compliance. When the real crisis arrived, this strategy found willing accomplices in a culture already primed for performative virtue. The height of this hypocrisy revealed itself during the pandemic, exposing not just empty virtue signaling, but active participation in one of the most egregious civil rights violations in recent American history. As millions changed their profile pictures and posted solidarity symbols for social justice, these same voices fell silent—or worse, actively participated in the persecution of two distinct groups: the unvaccinated and the vaccine-injured. The Profitable Performance of PowerThe economic devastation fell hardest on those least able to bear it. While professionals attended Zoom meetings in their pajamas, service workers faced an impossible choice: show up to what was marketed as a deadly environment or lose their livelihoods. The data tells the story: - Black-owned businesses declined by 41% during the first few months of lockdowns - Latino unemployment reached 18.9%, the highest of any demographic - Women left the workforce in unprecedented numbers, erasing decades of gains - Small businesses, the primary path to middle-class stability in minority communities, closed at triple the rate of their corporate competitors The financial beneficiaries were clear: - Amazon’s market value increased by $570 billion - Zoom’s stock rose 396% - Moderna executives became billionaires overnight - Pfizer reported record profits of $100 billion - BlackRock acquired 34% of single-family homes in major markets During the lockdown, ostensibly put in place to “protect the vulnerable”, vulnerable small businesses lost $4.6 trillion in value, with minority-owned enterprises accounting for 41% of closures despite representing only 20% of total businesses.

The data tells the story: - Black-owned businesses declined by 41% during the first few months of lockdowns - Latino unemployment reached 18.9%, the highest of any demographic - Women left the workforce in unprecedented numbers, erasing decades of gains - Small businesses, the primary path to middle-class stability in minority communities, closed at triple the rate of their corporate competitors The financial beneficiaries were clear: - Amazon’s market value increased by $570 billion - Zoom’s stock rose 396% - Moderna executives became billionaires overnight - Pfizer reported record profits of $100 billion - BlackRock acquired 34% of single-family homes in major markets During the lockdown, ostensibly put in place to “protect the vulnerable”, vulnerable small businesses lost $4.6 trillion in value, with minority-owned enterprises accounting for 41% of closures despite representing only 20% of total businesses.

A tweet or a regulatory shift can send prices soaring, while unexpected market shocks like trade wars can wipe out billions of dollars in minutes. This volatility is behind two key terms that define cryptocurrency market cycles: bull and bear markets. Understanding these trends isn’t just about knowing when to buy or sell—it’s about survival. The differences between a bull and bear market are simple yet complex. A bull market fuels optimism, risk-taking, and price surges, while a bear market brings fear, sell-offs, and a test of investor resilience. This article will explain what defines these market conditions, and how they impact cryptocurrency. The terms "bull market" and "bear market" date back to the 18th century. A bull charges with its horns upward, symbolizing rising prices, while a bear swipes downward, representing a market decline. In traditional equities markets, a bull market is generally defined as a sustained period of rising stock prices, typically lasting months or years, with gains of 20% or more. With a few key differences, bull and bear markets in crypto function much the same as traditional finance. Unlike legacy markets, however, crypto cycles are amplified by: Cryptocurrency investors rely on technical, macroeconomic, and on-chain analysis to identify trends and effectively navigate market cycles. “Standard technical analysis tools like moving averages, Relative Strength Index, and Bollinger Bands, can help signal cyclical shifts along with correlated markets such as the NASDAQ and Tech Stocks,” Mike Marshall, Amberdata’s head of research, told Decrypt. “Additionally, macro factors, including Fed policy, inflation, and global events, also heavily influence crypto cycles.” On January 20, 2025, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $108,786, spurred on by the hope of a friendlier regulatory environment in the United States under newly re-elected President Donald Trump, who had promised the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Some analysts speculated that the industry was in a bull market, with some even calling it a 'supercycle'—a prolonged period of economic expansion driven by sustained demand and investor optimism. However, that narrative was challenged when Bitcoin tumbled more than 31% to nearly $73,000 two months later. “Everyone seemed to be saying that when the Trump administration comes in, it's going to give such a huge boost to crypto regulations,” Alice Liu, Head of Research at CoinMarketCap, told Decrypt at ETH Denver. “But so far, we haven't seen that play out in action.” However, as Liu explained, this drop in Bitcoin’s price did not necessarily mean a bear market had taken over. “This is a technical pullback as opposed to a structural change. The reason for that is the liquidity is still healthy,” she said. Liquidity—how easily assets can be bought and sold without significantly impacting price—is key in distinguishing bull and bear markets. High liquidity indicates a market where transactions occur smoothly, with minimal price volatility, due to a large number of active buyers and sellers. In bear markets, liquidity tends to dry up as trading slows, amplifying price volatility. “Even in reaction to the market shock, we saw a definite spike in trade volume, averaging around $150 million to $160 million daily,” Liu said. “And even now, as the dust has settled a little, we still see a healthy trade volume moving through the market.” Defining the start of a Bitcoin bull market isn’t always straightforward, since different analysts use varying metrics to pinpoint its beginning. Some argue that it starts when prices recover from a major downturn, while others believe it only becomes clear once previous all-time highs are surpassed. “Technically, one could say the bull market begins with capitulation, as prices start to rise, but most people only perceive a bull market in Bitcoin after the prior all-time high is reached until the bubble pops about a year later,” Michael Terpin, founder and CEO of Transform Ventures, told Decrypt. Capitulation is when an investor, often driven by fear or panic, gives up on trying to recover losses and sells their assets. This typically happens after a prolonged market downturn triggered by a massive event, like the collapse of FTX in November 2022. Investors who hold onto their cryptocurrency despite being in a bear market, and mounting pressures to sell, are considered to have “diamond hands.” The term "diamond hands" originated in 2018 on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit. Not all financial analysts agree that a 20% swing should be considered the standard for measuring whether a market is in bull or bear territory. “I think the typical 20% threshold that’s commonly used to define bull and bear markets in traditional finance may not be as applicable to crypto, due to the wider price moves in the latter and the 24/7 trading that makes crypto more sensitive to global events,” Coinbase Head of Institutional Research David Duong told Decrypt. As Duong explained, crypto is often used as a proxy when traditional markets are closed, increasing the magnitude of the reaction to crypto prices. “I’d be more inclined to use metrics like the 200-day moving average, in combination with measuring the sustainability of the given upside or downside move,” he said. “For example, how long the move lasts to define a bull or bear market.” While crypto markets share similarities with traditional financial markets, they have unique characteristics—including extreme volatility, higher sensitivity to hype, and regulatory changes that set them apart. “When it comes to cryptocurrency-specific technical indicators, I prefer the Market Value to Realized Value ratio or the MVRV z-score to gauge how markets are moving,” Duong said. Investor sentiment plays an important role in shaping market cycles, with various indicators offering insights into broad trends. Measures like the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), the Put/Call Ratio, and the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Sentiment Survey help gauge investor confidence and risk appetite. One widely followed metric, the Fear and Greed Index, aggregates market factors to assess whether investors lean toward caution or excitement. The Fear and Greed Index ranges from 0 to 100, with lower values indicating fear, suggesting cautious or bearish investor sentiment, and higher values reflecting greed, signaling optimism or bullish market behavior. On March 30, 2025, as of this writing, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index stood at 32 (Fear), up from 17 (Extreme Fear) earlier in the month. While such indices don’t predict price movements, they often reflect broader shifts in investor thinking. “Investors often look to sentiment as a key indicator to assess whether markets are nearing a top or bottom,” Joe Vezzani, CEO and co-founder of crypto sentiment aggregator LunarCrush, told Decrypt. “Current crypto market sentiment reached its lowest point since August 2024, when volatility spiked due to the unwinding of the yen carry trade.” For financial analyst Jacob King, founder and CEO of WhaleWire, market sentiment also depends on whether investors believe the data. “Indicators exist—if you trust the data, which is questionable,” King told Decrypt. “Bitcoin falling below the 200-day moving average is a major red flag. When bulls fail to hold that line, the market structure weakens, and declines accelerate.” Markets go through natural growth and decline cycles. While no strategy guarantees success, those who take a long-term, well-researched approach are better positioned to navigate financial uncertainties. “It's important to note that what defines a bull market in crypto today isn’t just price—it’s utility, infrastructure maturity, and institutional participation,” Mike Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, told Decrypt. “When it comes down to it, the key indicators are transaction volume acceleration, fee growth, stablecoin velocity, and capital formation on-chain.

View all partners The first months of Donald Trump’s presidency have been defined by a single word: tariffs. He has framed tariffs as a panacea to the woes of the American economy, promising they will restore the country’s manufacturing sector and reduce the national deficit. As the United States’ largest trading partner, Canada’s smaller economy is poised to suffer the most from a prolonged trade war. Although the price of all consumer goods will be affected, the grocery aisle has become a particular battleground. Canadians have remained defiant, with vows to “buy Canadian” already spurring rapid drops in the sale of American products. But with calls for the country to strengthen its economic backbone and reduce dependence on the U.S., perhaps it’s also time to consider rebooting Canada’s grocery sector to better serve Canadians as well. Read more: Canada is now in a trade war with the U.S. — here's what you need to know to prepare for it Rising grocery bills have been an ongoing concern for Canadians long before Trump’s inauguration. Today, an estimated 18 per cent of Canadians are struggling with food insecurity owing to persistent inflation and the rising cost of living. Food banks saw a record number of monthly visits in 2024 as a result. Yet, even as consumers feel the squeeze, Canada’s grocery giants have been posting record profits. Loblaw Companies Limited, whose supermarkets hold a dominant 28 per cent share of the sector, has become the poster child for this trend. In the final quarter of 2022, as Canadians were grappling with rapid inflation on their grocery bills, Loblaw posted $529 million in profits — up 30 per cent from the previous year. This has led customers to accuse Loblaw and other large grocery chains of profiteering, provoking both a 100,000 signature petition against “greedflation” and a month-long boycott of Loblaw chains. All this while Loblaw was still reeling from a bread price-fixing scandal yielding a $500 million antitrust settlement. Read more: Food giants reap enormous profits during times of crisis In response to the mounting concerns, the federal government met with the heads of Loblaw, Sobeys, Metro, Costco and Walmart in 2023 to discuss stabilizing grocery prices in Canada. Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would threaten and later implement amendments to the Competition Act through Bill C-56, although these reforms were focused less on immediately lowering grocery bills and more on giving new tools to Canada’s competition watchdog. Another area of concern is the initiatives supermarket chains such as Loblaw and Metro have been investing their profits in. Since 2020, supermarkets in Canada have invested heavily in self-checkout aisles. While initially a concession to the social distancing measures of the COVID-19 pandemic, these kiosks have become a ubiquitous — and often unwelcome — part of the retail experience for both workers and consumers. Beyond the concern that self-checkouts pressure customers to perform more work, they have also increased the precarity of supermarket employees. These technologies generally reduce total worker hours and eliminate well-paying full-time positions, all with an eye towards boosting profit margins. Read more: The rise of robo-retail: Who gets left behind when retail is automated? Loblaw has also invested in automating their fleet of delivery vehicles, jeopardizing jobs in the logistics sector at a time when Canada’s unemployment rate, already struggling to recover, is expected to rise due to Trump’s tariffs. There is also the looming concern of dynamic pricing. Following the lead of American grocery stores such as Kroger, chains run by Loblaw, Metro and Sobeys have begun to implement electronic price tags. These tags enable retailers to instantaneously update prices based on supply and demand, similar to surge pricing on ride-sharing apps like Uber. While online commentators were quick to mock fast food chain Wendy’s for potentially using dynamic pricing to charge more for a Frosty on a hot day, this practice becomes more problematic as the availability of family staples like baby formula, which already experiences perennial scarcity, are affected by the trade war. There is little reason to believe Canada’s grocery industry will reform itself. Many of the pro-consumer and pro-worker initiatives put forth by these chains have amounted to little more than public relations moves. The much-lauded COVID hero pay for front-line grocery workers disappeared only months into the pandemic, despite pressure from unions and MPs during the Omicron wave. Loblaw’s widely publicized price freeze on No Name products was similarly criticised for its short duration and for merely repackaging seasonal price freezes as a pro-consumer initiative. The company’s promise to create a discounted version of its already discounted grocery chain No Frills drew further scepticism, with the stock being entirely sourced from Loblaw brands that generate higher revenue for the company. The question remains: what concrete measures can be implemented to safeguard Canadian grocery bills as our country navigates this next crisis? A report from the Broadbent Institute suggests the idea of a windfall profit tax, which would incentivize grocery companies to invest excess profits into price reductions or higher wages. A more durable reform would involve creating a central bank-style regulatory entity to oversee the grocery industry, instead of relying on industry-born measures such as Canada’s recently introduced grocery code of conduct. Read more: The new Grocery Code of Conduct should benefit both Canadians and the food industry Federal or provincial legislation could be also passed that places guardrails on dynamic pricing in the grocery aisle, if not banning the controversial practice altogether. Government grants and tax incentive programs could be withheld from companies that invest heavily into automating workforces so the government isn’t inadvertently subsidizing job losses. The Competition Bureau’s 2023 report highlights another key issue: there is a need for all levels of government to shift from subsidizing large chains and encourage the growth of independent grocers in the Canadian market, driving down prices for consumers through meaningful, local competition. Trump’s trade war has filled Canadians with a newfound pride and motivation to buy local to support the economy.

More Wednesday could bring the total to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) While the economic data was a bit softer on the margin last week, markets were likely rattled more by concerns about the upcoming tariff announcements on President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day,” scheduled for Wednesday, April 2. Though the range of possible outcomes is extensive, the scope and size of the tariffs should be meaningful. Goldman Sachs estimates a five-percentage-point increase in tariffs trims 1% to 2% from S&P 500 earnings growth. So, Goldman Sachs has lowered its 2025 earnings per share growth estimate to 7%. Strategas Research Partners notes that the size of the contemplated tariffs could bring the total size to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union as a group account for almost 50% of imports in the U.S. Following COVID-19 and the last trade war, supply chains have made progress in diversifying away from China. Share Of U.S. Imports: Last 12 Months While supply chains have reduced their dependence on China, it still has the largest trade surplus with the U.S., making it likely to remain subject to significant and possibly increased tariffs. Mexico and Canada also have large trade surpluses, so they are targets. Notably, the U.S. has significant leverage with many large trading partners as their exports to the U.S. make up a large enough portion of their GDP. If sizable tariffs crimp their net exports to the U.S., as would be expected, their economic growth will suffer. The European Union has a significant trade surplus with the U.S., so they are expected to be targeted when the administration proceeds with reciprocal tariffs this week. Reciprocal tariffs are meant to place U.S. tariffs equal to those experienced by U.S. goods imported into that region. If value-added taxes are included in the reciprocal calculation by the administration, then the tariffs on the European Union will be significantly higher than if only their tariff rates are considered. Selected Countries With Large Trade Surplus With The U.S. President Trump’s use of tariffs and threats of additional tariffs has added to the policy uncertainty. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. As we have experienced since mid-February, all other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas Research Partners, stocks usually do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. The poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen, but the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty After a 1.5% decline last week, the S&P 500 sits 9.2% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a plunge of 20.5% since mid-December. Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness and that stress intensified last week. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks isn’t yet at levels seen before past recessions. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Beyond Wednesday’s highly anticipated tariff announcements, Friday’s monthly jobs release will be an important marker. If job growth continues, there will be less concern about any drag from increased tariffs pushing the economy into recession. The March unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%, but growth in nonfarm payrolls and hours worked should be closely watched for signs of further softness. U.S. Unemployment Rate While the Federal Reserve projects two rate cuts, markets expect three for 2025, with the first in mid-June. These expectations could change quickly depending on this week’s releases. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected If you own your stocks as an investment — just like you’d own an apartment, house, or a farm — look at them as a business. – Warren Buffett Warren Buffett’s mentor, Benjamin Graham, taught him much about investing. Graham’s most essential lessons were to analyze stocks as a business and not react to short-term fluctuations in the quoted price of a stock. Buffett has said that chapters eight and twenty of Benjamin Graham’s “The Intelligent Investor” book are the bedrock of his investment process. Graham thought investors should look at stock holdings as owning a part of various businesses, like being a “silent partner” in a private company. Hence, stocks should be valued as a portion of the company’s intrinsic value, not as something constantly changing in price on the stock market. An investor should take advantage of the stock market’s fickle view of a company or concerns about macroeconomic factors rather than allowing it to dictate what one should do. Valuing stocks as a business and purchasing stock with a “margin of safety” enable investors to ignore the market’s emotional ups and downs. For Graham, the “margin of safety” meant buying at a price below the “indicated or appraised value,” which should allow an investment to provide a reasonable return even if there are errors in the analysis. The recent market turmoil makes it an optimal time to revisit investment first principles. Given the growing downside risk to the economy and the current inflationary environment, investors should find comfort in owning quality companies with pricing power when searching for opportunities during any selloff. Quality is defined as high returns on capital, consistent earnings, and low debt levels, which should help the company survive a possible economic slowdown or tariff-related challenges. For example, consider Constellation Brands (STZ), which is best known for owning the rights to Corona and Modelo beers in the U.S. It also owns some wine and spirits brands, but beer accounts for about 80% of its sales. Potential tariffs on Mexico could negatively impact its beer earnings since almost all its beer is produced in Mexico. It seems unlikely that a tariff headwind will erode the long-term value of its beer brands, even if profitability could be dented in the short term. Corona and Modelo have two of the best growth profiles among beer brands, and alcohol consumption tends to remain relatively unscathed by economic downturns. Notably, there are fears that the GLP-1 diet drugs and a growing preference for cannabis could weigh on long-term alcohol consumption which could be a structural headwind. On the other hand, the stock is now selling for a multi-year low in valuation across several metrics. Constellation boasts a solid balance sheet and free cash flow generation to sustain it through a possible recession or tariff-related disruption. Just as the zenith of economic and earnings optimism in early 2025 gave way to creeping concerns about the durability of growth under pressure from possible tariff increases, maximum pessimism will eventually give way to a better reality. History tells us that better stock returns follow maximum policy uncertainty. Whether next week’s tariff announcement provides that bottom is unclear, but markets have shifted from pricing in a benign environment to a more difficult path. Current data points to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. Macroeconomic forecasting is fraught, so one should still admit that the odds of a recession have risen, and no one truly knows the eventual outcome. Though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies, and the tariffs can be reduced in the short term. In addition, the focus could shift to more market-friendly topics of tax cuts and deregulation. In any case, investors must always deal with uncertainty and unpredictable market volatility. Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham have provided a better blueprint for dealing with this by focusing on the health and valuation of the underlying businesses rather than the macroeconomic environment or the movement of stock prices. This focus doesn’t avoid the volatility but allows one to use it to their advantage if executed correctly. Just as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) keeps more than enough cash to pay insurance claims without touching any stock investments, investors should have enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses to ignore any depressive states of the stock market and perhaps benefit from taking advantage when they invariably occur.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

(“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025.

Title: Googlers have questions for the company after getting smaller pay bumps

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. With "Signalgate" dominating headlines, BI's Katie Notopoulos wants to know: Which high-ranking official's group chat texting style most matches yours? Let her know here for an upcoming story! On the agenda today: But first: Googlers have questions. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. We've written a lot about the tech industry's hardcore moment. Talk of efficiency and intensity has replaced perks and pampering. Rolling layoffs have become the norm. Management layers are thinning. AI can help companies do more with less. Now, at least at Google, some employees aren't pleased about their recent compensation packages. And they're speaking out about it. Some Google employees received smaller pay bumps in their 2025 compensation packages than they anticipated, according to an exclusive report from my BI colleague Hugh Langley. Googlers raised the issue at a recent company all-hands, per a meeting transcript that Hugh obtained, where they wondered why some employees had seen a decrease in their refreshed stock grants and overall comp. A Google exec at the all-hands said some employees in less technical roles received smaller equity packages this year to calibrate pay to local markets. But the story got me thinking about how Google's lower comp fits into the changing tech industry. I spoke with Hugh about his reporting and what it means for Google. Steve: What's the reaction to your scoop? Hugh: Whenever I write about compensation, I get a lot of feedback from employees across Big Tech. I know some of these stories can have a "world's smallest violin" feeling to them — Googlers, on the whole, are still paid very well! But in the battle for talent, this stuff really matters. What impact do you see this having on Google's workforce? The fact it got raised during the company's all-hands means it's on a lot of employees' minds. The biggest possible impact is a hit to morale, especially for employees in non-technical roles that have been dinged hardest. As the tech industry becomes more hardcore about work, how do you see Google fitting into that overall trend? Google is certainly going hardcore, but in typical Google fashion, it's doing it less dramatically, less publicly, and without any of the political chest-thumping we've seen from the likes of Meta. Googlers once felt they were the only ones safe from layoffs, but now rolling job cuts have become the new norm. It's also chopped away at management layers and in some cases set a higher bar for performance. Of course, there are plenty of employees who see this all as a good thing, but there's a feeling among many staff that the era of mollycoddling at Alphabet is well and truly over. Many assumed Elon Musk's proximity to President Donald Trump would be a net positive — but the opposite has proven to be true. Musk's involvement with DOGE has triggered an identity crisis within Tesla. Over the years, Tesla and its CEO have faced dire predictions, but each time they seem to have emerged stronger. However, for some employees, analysts, and investors, Musk's political entanglements represent a new challenge. Why this time feels different. Also read: The business of buying and selling companies is slowing down. Buyout funds recently underperformed the stock market for the first time in decades. But that doesn't mean PE vets and newcomers have to fret. Certain opportunities are in demand, and — if you're more junior — there's good news for you, too. What to know about PE careers. Since CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg started calling for more "masculine energy" in the workplace, a small group of their female colleagues has been organizing their resistance. Some female executives worry that big business's latest testosterone injection could push them out of leadership roles. Others see it as galvanizing, a sign that women are making serious progress. "The masks and the gloves are off." "If a billionaire can steal from me, I can scrape a little off the top, too." That's how one person justifies stealing little treats from Whole Foods. Middle-class shoplifters and thieves of opportunity are fudging Amazon returns and sneaking Whole Foods goods to stick it to The Man — whose name, in this case, is Jeff Bezos. The problem is that small-time swiping doesn't actually effect the change these anti-Amazon avengers want to see. Worse, it could be causing unintended harm. This week's quote: "We are catching a lot of balls, with very little people. Eventually one of them is probably going to fall." — A NOAA employee concerned about how DOGE's job cuts at the agency will affect extreme weather alerts and air travel forecasts.

Title: ‘I was 34 and all my friends were having kids... I was like: what am I waiting for?’

Karen Heffernan wouldn’t know the father of her child if he passed her on the street. What she does know is what he looked like as a baby, his height, that he is Danish, and has a clean bill of health. That’s because when Heffernan, a 37-year-old hairdresser from Blackrock in Co Dublin was in her early 30s, she began to explore the idea of intrauterine insemination (IUI), using donor sperm. “I always knew I wanted a child, but my last long-term relationship ended when I was 25. I told myself, if I didn’t meet anyone I would be happy to have a child by myself, and then I hit 30 and gave myself two years to look into the option of using a donor properly. But then Covid hit,” she recalls. “That put a stop to socialising and going on dates. When restrictions were lifted I was around 34 and all my friends were having kids at the same time and I was like ‘what am I waiting for?‘” Before she went for the first consultation at a fertility clinic to discuss her options, Heffernan sat her parents Paula and Alan down to explain her plans. “I knew that taking this on as a single mother would require support. From the outset, they were 100 per cent behind my decision and my mum came with me for my first consultation,” she says. At a new Thérapie Fertility Clinic in Carrickmines, Heffernan was told of her options. Learning about women’s fertility and how rapidly it starts to decrease in their 30s, she knew she would be taking a chance on the donor route. She purchased three “straws” – three IUI rounds with the donor’s sperm, at a total cost of around €5,000. Under the Children, Family and Relationships Act (CFRA) 2015, which commenced in Ireland in May 2020, all imported donations – sperm or eggs – must be from a non-anonymous, or traceable, donor. Donors must agree to open contact with a donor-conceived child once that child reaches 18 years of age. “The donor was listed under the European Sperm Bank. In Ireland, there’s a lot of rules and regulations, so only three women in Ireland can use the same donor, and we can only use what is termed ‘open donors’, who can be contacted at a later stage by the child,” Heffernan explains. “I was only looking for a healthy, happy baby so that meant a donor [with] no health issues. It didn’t matter if they had brown or blonde hair, or [were] a boy or a girl.” [ The meaning of motherhood in a world that devalues, judges and polices itOpens in new window ] When her first attempt with IUI failed, Heffernan decided to go for a second round, but this time she kept what she was doing under wraps. In October 2022, she found out she was pregnant. “I live alone so I was sitting in my house in shock and happy-crying. I couldn’t believe it had happened for me so quickly. I hadn’t told my parents that I had gone for the second round It was my mum’s birthday on the day I was getting the blood tests to confirm my pregnancy, so I wrote on the card ‘Love from baby H’,” she adds. “When I told people I was pregnant, some would ask if I was going to say how it happened. My reaction was always, of course I will, because getting pregnant from a donor is nothing to be ashamed of.” In June 2023, her daughter was born. Heffernan sees her own family in the looks and traits of her child, now 21 months old, but has noticed some characteristics that are probably from the donor. “She’s quite a tall baby. Her skin is more sallow than mine too, but she looks like my family and she’s quite active in the way I was at her age.” Aimee Crinion wasn’t thinking about having children when she married her partner Dave in 2009. Then aged 32, and with both of them working full-time – she as a professional dog walker and he in IT – there was plenty of time to start a family, but first they would travel, enjoy plenty of nights out and long lie-ins. When the couple from Glasnevin in Dublin 9 decided to have children, they expected it to happen naturally. Except it didn’t. At 36, Crinion shared her concerns with her doctor and the couple subsequently opted for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) to try to help them to conceive. Crinion knew there were no guarantees. I knew I didn’t have it in me to go through IVF in my 40s. We had looked into adoption but we realised we were also too old for that “We went for one round at the Merrion Fertility Clinic in Dublin 2, and in our minds we were thinking, we’ll do it once. We were baffled why I couldn’t get pregnant. We were both healthy and neither of us had fertility problems – I simply wasn’t getting pregnant naturally, even with an egg reserve that wasn’t bad for my age,” she explains. “We did our first round of IVF against a background of people telling us that it never works the first time, which I thought was really pointless advice. But they were right, it didn’t work and I was desperately upset because all of my friends were married and had children or were pregnant and it consumed me – all I could see were babies everywhere. And that was all I wanted, to bring a child into the world.” Crinion credits the strength of her marriage as the reason for getting through the first failed round. Dave was a constant support and they had each other at the end of it all. [ ‘When our last embryo failed, the clinic told us there was nothing more they could do for us’Opens in new window ] Crinion’s father Michael became very ill during the same period, and died in October 2013. It was an incredibly stressful time. “I found it so hard to lose him and not have been able to let him meet my kids because I always believed he would,” she says. In 2014, the couple decided to go for one last round of IVF. “I knew I didn’t have it in me to go through IVF in my 40s. We had looked into adoption but we realised we were also too old for that. I remember that day in May in the Merrion Clinic and one of the nurses there turned to me and said ‘this is going to work, you’ve done everything you can and I’m telling you, this is going to work’. She mentioned my dad, just a passing comment, and something felt different, almost like he was watching over me.” Having never done a pregnancy test herself for the fear of disappointment, one morning just after a blood test at the clinic while out walking her dogs, she took their call. “I was on Killiney Hill with six dogs running around me and all the clinic said at the other end of the phone was ‘yes’. I started screaming, ‘Finally, finally’. Me and all these dogs [were] running towards the car park to get to my van. It was magical,” she says. Her son Hugo was born in February 2015. Content with her life, Crinion still had the option to pursue IVF, but didn’t know if she could go through the process again. Two years after her son was born, she went to the doctor with a urinary tract infection (UTI). “I gave the doctor a sample for the UTI test and she said, ‘Do you know you’re pregnant?’ I couldn’t process that. I remember saying something like ‘Okay ... but can you give me something for the UTI’ and then very quickly adding that I couldn’t be pregnant because I couldn’t have children naturally.” Arabella was born in November 2017, and there was no question of IVF again. “I do consider myself lucky. I’m 50 now with two beautiful children, a husband, a dog, and a lot of grey hair. As difficult as that path was to get here, I am very grateful for it all. I do believe my father has watched over every step.” Having raised three birth children of her own, Mags Murphy from Enniscorthy in Co Wexford is now a foster mother. Since 2018, she and her husband Danny, who also have three grandchildren, have taken in 10 foster children over short and long-term periods, with ongoing check-ins with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and support from Foster Care Ireland (FCI), an organisation that places children with foster parents. There were 5,595 children in the care of the State last year, according to Tusla, with 91 per cent of those children in foster homes. For Murphy, these figures are heartbreaking. “All of these children deserve a parent, or a caring adult that can make a difference. They have done nothing wrong, and yet many carry this feeling of guilt that it was something they did,” says the 57-year-old. “Even when they come into care, the children try so hard to please. They ask, ‘am I being good?’ and you’re thinking, ‘you are a child of four or five, you shouldn’t be worrying about having to be good or trying to figure out what is expected of you from adults.’ It’s very, very hard on them.” Murphy says her house has always been a lively, loud, and busy home. Her children – now 31, 35, and 37 – often had friends over. For 30 years, she ran her own childcare business for preschoolers, and over a 10-year period had 12 children from Belarus stay at Christmas or during the summer months under the Chernobyl Children’s Project International, founded by Adi Roche. When they call you mam it’s lovely but also sort of bittersweet, because you feel a sense of loss for them A self-confessed nurturer, it was after her children left home that she and Danny began to discuss fostering. Following assessments, vetting and training, they were accepted, and in April 2018 got their first placement under the “respite fostering” programme, where a child already with foster parents would come for a weekend or a week to give them and their foster parents a break. “At first it was like I was a doting granny because I would take this little child in on a Friday and they would return to a foster parent on the Monday, and you could really have fun with them and take them places. You didn’t have to deal with homework or the stress of school and all that goes with full foster care,” says Murphy. [ Fostering: ‘The children’s situation is so precarious – while we may not have everything to offer, we offer everything we have’Opens in new window ] “You would also see their behaviours and ask yourself if you could deal with that on a daily basis. But then we got our first boy and he was with us for four years. He was really lucky because he was reunited with his mum. It was a happy story. That often doesn’t happen for children in foster care.” It has been a challenging experience at times, too, but FCI’s link workers have offered a lot of support to the Murphys over the years. Murphy has maintained contact with many of the children who stayed with her, and has framed photographs of them all on the wall in her home. Some of the children have referred to her and Danny as “Mam and Dad” when speaking about their new family in school or with friends. “When they call you Mam it’s lovely but also sort of bittersweet, because you feel a sense of loss for them,” Murphy says. “You also want them to become comfortable and confident enough to just be children.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Central to Rocket Lab's participation is its next-generation Neutron rocket, a reusable carbon composite launch vehicle engineered for medium-lift missions. Neutron is designed to deliver up to 13,000 kilograms to orbit, supporting both single-payload missions and multi-satellite constellation deployments. Built on Rocket Lab's track record of reliability-with 63 Electron launches completed and multiple orbital payload deliveries in 2025 alone-Neutron is positioned as a competitive contender in the defense launch market. Neutron's inaugural launch is scheduled for the latter half of 2025 from Launch Complex 3 at Wallops Island, Virginia. With this mission, Neutron will become the first vehicle to support NSSL operations from the Mid-Atlantic region. Rocket Lab's inclusion in the program required meeting stringent eligibility standards, and a successful debut flight will make the company eligible to receive individual task orders for NSSL missions. The NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1 program aims to cultivate a diversified and resilient domestic launch capability, selecting just five companies to compete for up to 30 missions through 2029, with a potential extension to 2034. As part of its onboarding, Rocket Lab has secured a $5 million task order to demonstrate its mission assurance framework tailored for national security launches. "Supporting assured access to space for the nation's most important missions has always been the goal with our Neutron rocket, and we're incredibly proud to [be] selected by the U.S. Space Force to demonstrate this commitment for the NSSL. Neutron is a powerful new launch option that will set a new standard for performance, affordability, and reliability in medium launch, and its selection to the program demonstrates a high degree of confidence by the Department of Defense in Neutron's capabilities ahead of its first launch later this year. We can't wait to showcase Neutron as the important platform it will become for the Department of Defense," said Rocket Lab Founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck.

Title: The Inconvenient Truth about H-1B Visas
URL: https://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-inconvenient-truth-about-h-1b-visas/
Time Published: 2025-03-30T04:01:00Z
Full Content:
Americans are told that mass immigration will bring the world’s geniuses to our country. The numbers tell a different story. President Donald Trump's mandate from the voters undoubtedly gives him wide latitude to close the border to illegal aliens, which he has done. Border crossings are down 90 percent and more illegal aliens were arrested in Trump’s first 50 days than across Joe Biden's final year in office. Now, many in the America First movement are asking, “What about reducing legal immigration?” Big Tech moguls Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy accidentally raised awareness of this controversial topic in December by defending—while also calling for reforms to—the H-1B visa program, which allows companies to hire specialist workers from abroad for up to 6 years. “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H-1B,” Musk noted on X. Ramaswamy said the “badly broken” program “should be replaced with one that focuses on selecting the very best of the best.” Yet he's also blamed American culture for “venerat[ing] mediocrity over excellence,” justifying the foreign worker program. “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,” Ramaswamy declared, so “top tech companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over 'native' Americans.” The resulting debates were colorful and worth reading, and they revealed a powerful, widespread desire to reduce America's influx of legal immigrants, and not just among America Firsters. A Rasmussen poll published days after the Musk-Vivek ruckus found that 60 percent of likely voters believe America does not need more H-1B workers since the country “already has enough talented people to train and recruit.” That includes nearly three-quarters of Republicans, two-thirds of swing voters, and almost half of Democrats. At least one California Democrat in Congress has criticized the H-1B system for rampant fraud and abuse. Trump, for his part, denied a larger share of H-1B applications in his first term (18 percent) than either Obama (11 percent) or Biden (just three percent). Yet he recently praised the program, saying he was “a believer in H-1B” who had used it many times in his business properties. That doesn't mean Trump 2.0 won't scale down the program, though. In March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ruled that visa policies now fall under his purview as “foreign affairs,” allowing him broad discretion to revise visa rules without the drawn-out public notice/comment process. But what are the facts around America's immigration system, and what role do H-1B visas play in it? The H-1B program is capped annually at 85,000 three-year visas, which can be renewed for another three-year term. Estimates put the total number of H-1B workers in the nation at 500,000–600,000 people. At the same time, H-1B holders may apply for lawful permanent residency, allowing them to live and work here indefinitely. The process isn't automatic, but a significant portion—perhaps as high as 90 percent—of H-1B-holders ultimately receive green cards, according to Homeland Security “adjustment of status” statistics. (No one knows the actual figure, apparently.) While the debate that Musk and Ramaswamy kicked off centers on temporary foreign workers, the real debate on the Right should focus on the vastly larger mass-immigration pipeline permitted by our expansive “family reunification” policies. There are roughly 13 million green card holders in the United States, dwarfing the number holding H-1B visas, about half a million. We've admitted more than 1 million more each year since 1990 on average, even during the bleak COVID years of 2020–21. That includes an indeterminate number of H-1B workers. A permanent resident may apply for U.S. citizenship after five years, or three if they marry a U.S. citizen. Between 2021 and 2024, 2.6 million permanent residents became naturalized U.S. citizens, 98 percent of them through the green card process. Once naturalized, however, new citizens may invite in their spouses, married or unmarried children, and even adult siblings—and at 675,000 people per year, the annual immigration cap for family reunification is far larger than any temporary worker program. This is the mass immigration pipeline that a growing number of Trump voters wish to dramatically scale down, if not pause outright and indefinitely as past generations did after periods of intensive migration. We've been in such a period since the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. Since then, the percentage of foreign-born residents has skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high of 15.6 percent, or 51 million people, today. The mass immigration that the statute enabled has created serious political consequences for the republic. Naturalized citizens made up a record-breaking 1 in 10 voters in the 2024 election and voted at higher rates than native-born Americans. Forty-four percent self-identified as Democrats, compared with just 30 percent who called themselves Republicans. This has been true for decades, which is why leftist get-out-the-vote groups have spent a fortune courting immigrants as part of the Democratic Party's “New American Majority” program. Astonishingly, this aspect of our troubled immigration system has been largely forgotten, yet it's arguably the part that should concern MAGA voters most, given the movement's interest in putting American jobs, education, health, and well-being first. Perhaps far less attention should be paid to the people immigrating on temporary worker visas and more on this massive immigration pipeline of low-skilled workers under the family reunification policy. That doesn't excuse the glaring problems with the H-1B program, of course. Its proponents—such as Musk and Ramaswamy—often market the H-1B program as our nation's only tool for attracting highly sought-after experts, particularly in the tech industry. But the facts tell a different story. The H-1B program is marketed as importing “highly skilled foreign workers” into the United States. But that's stretching things… a lot. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) lists the requirements to apply: Attainment of a bachelor's degree and a sponsorship by a U.S. employer for a job requiring “highly specialized knowledge.” “Highly specialized knowledge” encompasses everything from a general neurology physician earning $380,000 per year down to an accountant paid $22 an hour, according to job listings on Indeed.com. Most of the positions offered to H-1B applicants are in Big Tech, but many are not. And the “nots” include entry-level mortgage assistants, e-commerce account executives, lathe machinists, bridge repair operators, college admissions consultants, AC/DC motor plant technicians, and life insurance call center specialists—jobs certainly fillable by native-born Americans. Speaking of the native-born, in most cases there is no legal requirement for companies to prioritize hiring Americans before foreigners. Nor are companies prohibited from replacing American employees with (presumably cheaper) H-1B workers, so many do. In 2022 alone, U.S. companies hired 34,000 new H-1B employees while laying off tens of thousands of Americans. Among them was Elon Musk's Tesla, which requested 2,000 new H-1B visas at the same time it was laying off 15,000 U.S. employees last April. The number one H-1B employer is Amazon at 9,265 foreign hires, per the USCIS list of H-1B employers and their total visa employees. Number two is the Indian tech multinational Infosys. This foreign company may be based in Bangalore, yet it's imported over 8,100 H-1B visa workers into the U.S. Infosys has a checkered past: In 2013, the company paid $34 million in a settlement with federal authorities for illegally using B-1 visitor visas for work requiring H-1B visas. Infosys admitted no wrongdoing. In 2019, Infosys reached an $800,000 settlement with California for again funneling nearly 500 employees into the state on B-1 visas, instead of H-1B visas, avoiding paying payroll taxes or disability and unemployment insurance. It's a similar story with the third-biggest H-1B employer: Cognizant Technology Solutions, an Indian tech company that's imported over 6,300 foreign workers into the U.S. In 2024, whistleblowers sued the company for discriminating against 2,000 American workers over imported Indian employees. Not surprisingly, 73 percent of H-1B visa holders come from India and 12 percent from China, countries famous for their ethno-nationalism and highly restrictive immigration systems. Those nations rarely offer citizenship or even permanent residency to foreigners. “I definitely knew it was because of me being an American, not being Indian, and also because I was black,” said one woman who was fired by Cognizant three days after suing the company. A jury agreed with her. While U.S. law clearly protects H-1B workers from discrimination by employers, there's far less scrutiny on employers discriminating against native-born workers in visa holders' favor. Fortunately, the Trump administration has begun cracking down on the practice. But conservatives should ask, “Is it enough?” Other H-1B employers are less shady but their actions will still make conservatives bristle. Hitachi Energy (visas: 45) is a Swiss renewable energy firm that prioritizes “sustainability” and a “commitment to human rights” on the march “towards carbon-neutral” power in line with “the UN's Sustainable Development Goals” on global warming. Similarly, Schlumberger (visas: 97) is a French multinational oil producer “accelerating decarbonization” to “reduce emissions . . . on the journey to net zero.” Again, these are foreign companies outsourcing American jobs to foreign workers… in America. At least these positions are filled by only the best and brightest, bringing much-needed talent to bolster America's economy. But across the country, many more jobs are filled by the luckiest, not the most talented. Every year the H-1B program is flooded with 386,000 applications by individuals who meet its minimum standards. Of these, 65,000 are selected by lottery, while another 20,000 are picked at random from a pool of applicants with master's degrees. Wily companies game the system, using staffing agencies to hire thousands of foreign workers desperate to enter the United States and get a shot at permanent residency and U.S. citizenship, while big companies get lower-cost employees who can't afford to leave. Critics on the right and the left have blasted this system as a revival of indentured servitude. If visa holders lose their job, they have 60 days to find a new position—and a sponsor—or risk overstaying their visa. Consequently, “H-1B workers can't complain too much” about lower wages, writes Peter Van Buren in The American Conservative. “Unable to change jobs freely . . . they have to take what they are given.” Not only experts and analysts, but also everyday people, take issue with the H-1B system. On Reddit, a social media app popular among young people, several users have bluntly criticized the program. An example: H1Bs are a way for firms to force job loyalty through indentured servitude (in spirit) and increase bottom lines by undercutting the acceptable salary range of the already existent American workforce. It's not to fill roles that they can't fill through American labor [due to] lack of availability, that's just the Trojan horse. Then there's socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). “Elon Musk is wrong,“ he tweeted in January. “The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire “the best and the brightest,” but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad. The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.” There are solutions to at least some of these problems. The Trump administration could raise the H-1B salary floor to stop foreign hires from undercutting Americans, prioritize the highest-paid positions to mitigate the lottery's “crowding out” effect, and weight certain industries above others. None of these fixes require shutting down the visa program entirely, but they would go a long way toward addressing its problems. But defenders of the system want to expand the H-1B cap, believing it the best way to discover the world's next Einstein. Yet the U.S. actually has a separate visa specifically for “extraordinary” individuals: the EB-1 “Einstein” visa, which grants permanent residency to 40,000 of the most gifted Olympic athletes, researchers, surgeons, and Pulitzer Prize winners each year. These are unquestionably the “high achievers” most Americans want to attract. Which raises the question, why invite so many middle-class, white-collar jobs through H-1B—particularly at a time of mass tech lay-offs? That's the question bothering so many 20- and 30-something men, a demographic sprinting towards Trump and the new Republican Party in search of hope, opportunity, and dignity. Recent tech industry lay-offs suggest H-1B visas, even if they worked as marketed, aren't needed—or wanted—in the current economy, especially if they lead to layoffs for hard-working Americans. In late February alone, healthcare, cybersecurity, and computer part manufacturers cut 6,000 jobs. Hewlett-Packard announced restructuring plans affecting an additional 6,000 jobs. That's small fry compared with the 380,000 U.S. tech workers laid off between 2022 and 2024, led by Tesla, Intel, and Cisco. Partly this was the result of letting go of extra hands that had been hired during the COVID pandemic to meet ballooning consumer demand, which has since dropped off. Other firms fear a looming recession, so are cutting labor costs to preserve critical cash reserves. Experts expect more lay-offs to come in 2025. A jobs shortage would argue against importing more middle-skill workers. “There is no shortage of qualified STEM workers,” argues the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports H-1B reform. “The H-1B program has transformed over time from a means to supplement the American tech workforce to a means of cheaply replacing it. Americans who are replaced by H-1B guest workers are often forced to train their replacements or risk losing their severance.” At the same time, the center points out, “foreign STEM workers often come from sham universities abroad—particularly in India—and have far fewer specialized skills than they claim.” The center records the stories of 11 different American tech workers unnecessarily replaced by “underqualified” foreign hires. “99 percent of people with H visas are totally underqualified. No skills. I worked with so many of them from Infosys. There are millions of Americans who could do this work,” one Seattle worker writes. “If we said anything, they'd accuse us of being racist, using the company's anti-discrimination policies,” laments another woman laid off from her insurance job. Immigration policy is almost always a numbers game, and a large segment—if not a majority—of the America First movement wants significantly fewer immigrations… or perhaps just few, period. The discussion around H-1B policy both illuminates and obfuscates this. On the one hand, the resentment felt by Americans whose jobs have been outsourced in their very own country suggests the Right wants to go beyond deporting illegal aliens and tighten immigration altogether. On the other hand, too much public discussion is hung up on the relatively modest number of H-1B workers, instead of the million low-skill immigrants who flood in legally each year simply because a family member happens to live here. Sixty percent of green card holders entered either as immediate relatives of a U.S. citizen or through “family-sponsored preferences.” These are decidedly not the world's “best and brightest” doctors, engineers, or AI experts. Chinese and Indians combined comprise just 11 percent of the lawful permanent resident population, whereas Mexicans, Dominicans, Filipinos, and Cubans together make up 36 percent, with Mexicans as the plurality. Nor are they vibrant, young workers with decades in the career force ahead of them: Just 20 percent of green card holders are 34 or younger, while 57 percent are age 35–64. Even without U.S. citizenship, they're entitled to Social Security benefits such as retirement and disability if they worked in the U.S. for at least ten years. This is the consequence not of prioritizing merit, as is often argued, but of the mass immigration system created by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. The H-1B fight is really over two different visions of America: Is it a special economic zone without borders or a concrete identity (America the idea), or are we a distinct people with a history, language, culture, and tradition (America the nation)? For MAGA, the answer will make all the difference in the world. Hayden Ludwig is the director of policy research for Restoration of America.

March 29, 2025 20:08 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, March 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Coyotes Are Smuggling Migrants Out of the United States

Time Published: 2025-03-29T21:17:18Z
Full Content:
A growing number of illegal migrants are smuggling themselves out of the United States to avoid the legal penalties of government deportations, according to multiple witnesses. “I’ve been a journalist for more than 25 years, but I never thought I would see this — ‘paquetes de retorno'” said Alfredo Corchado, an American journalist in Texas and Mexico and an executive editor at the Puente News Collaborative. On March 26 he told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations: [Coyotes] are now offering packages where [migrant] people can go back home …. [If] you want to go home, or you want to go back to Honduras, or maybe you don’t want to go back to Honduras because it’s too dangerous. [Or] you don’t want to go to Guatemala, but maybe you want to go to Costa Rica, and so they’re offering these [smuggling] packages where you can just go back home. Not all of them are taking it, I mean, many [are]. If migrants are deported by the United States government, they are separated from their families and detained in crowded jails, sometimes for many weeks. Once legally deported, migrants cannot visit for 10 years or longer, even when their relatives remain in the United States. They also lose possessions and easy access to their bank accounts. Haitians “are self-deporting right now because they don’t want the worst thing … because [the government] does send them back to Haiti immediately,” Jeff Lamour, an American businessman in Albertville, Alabama, told Breitbart News on Friday. Many Haitians have moved to Albertville for jobs once held by Americans in the chicken slaughterhouses. They got work permits from Biden’s deputies but are now losing them to Trump’s pro-American policies. Lamour added: This [self-deporting] industry with the coyotes, it has become a multi-million dollar industry over here now. You got those guys that are going from Indiana, from Alabama, in those vans where they’re smuggling people to New Mexico, to border states. They’re making a ton of money. If they go deposit money at the bank, it’s going to raise a red flag. You know, I had a gentleman a couple days ago trying to buy a car with cash, straight cash. He just don’t know what to do with it because he has a lot of cash from the shuttle industry. Smugglers “charge them $10,000 per head because a lot of people that are working are saving their money,” Lamour told told 1819News.com. “A lot of people are going back to Chile,” where they were living before Biden opened the border. Other Haitians are going into hiding, for example, by selling their cars to minimize the chance of any interaction with local police, he said: I sell cars for a living. I have my mechanic sitting next to me right there. He can tell you, as my witness — did we not have a guy come over here, return his car, because he’s scared to be deported? I had guys selling their car for $500 just so they won’t be deported. We see that every day. One local migrant “crossed from Brazil all the way to the United States,” Lamour told Breitbart News, adding: His wife and kids died in the [Darien Gap], and he had to leave them behind because he had to survive and save himself. Once he arrived in Mexico, he had to literally stay at the gay bathhouse [to avoid robbers, before he] made it over here through a Catholic charity. So far, the exit numbers are small compared to the resident population of roughly 18 million illegal migrants, of whom roughly 9 million were invited by President Joe Biden’s deputies. The New York Times acknowledged the trend: Since arriving in Denver in 2023, Cristian, 29, has delivered meals and worked on construction sites. (Like other migrants I interviewed, he worried that immigration agents would find him and spoke on the condition that I identify him only by his given name.) He sends money to his wife and children in Venezuela. Cristian does not have any tattoos, a customary gang indicator, he said. He possesses a work permit and an active asylum application, which theoretically protects him from imminent deportation. But the enforcement climate since Trump took office has changed Cristian’s calculus “360 degrees,” he told me. With the help of an American friend who escorted him to several immigration offices, he made an appointment to appear before a judge today so he could request a voluntary departure from the United States. (Immigrants who receive formal permission to leave have an easier time returning later.) … A family in Chicago recently left for Mexico, according to their lawyer. People have abandoned Springfield, Ohio — the town where Trump claimed Haitians were eating their pets — employers there told me. Others are contemplating leaving from elsewhere, like Houston. South of the border, northbound migrants are also turning back homewards. “It is true that people are going different directions,” Caleb Vitello, a senior official in Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, told the Council on Foreign Relations. For example, the northward foot and boat traffic in the dangerous Darien Gap between Colombia and Panama has dropped “because people aren’t risking that walk or that dangerous journey through there,” he said. The migrants’ exit is bad news for business groups who want more imported customers, workers, and renters to increase their profits and stock values. “The only way that we continue to grow economically is actually by increasing our levels of immigration,” said Andrea Flores, the vice-president for lobbying at FWD.us, a lobby group for West Coast investors in the consumer economy. Flores told the CFR event: I think some of the inquiries I get most around the country are not from the border [area] and not from major urban areas. It’s from places like Nebraska [where] I routinely will get outreach from, saying, “How do we push for getting us elder care workers, childcare workers? How do we get some restaurant workers to revitalize some of our small towns? … So I’m very pro [asking] “Why don’t we offer, you know, English language courses? Why does the federal government provide that? How do you help facilitate a new immigrant’s arrival so they don’t create the type of social challenges [for] any country facing increased immigration?” But the promise of cheap labor is “a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President JD Vance told an audience of investors in mid-March. “Real innovation makes us more productive, but it also, I think, dignifies our workers. It boosts our standard of living. It strengthens our workforce and the relative value of its labor.” “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. Fink continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … “If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations,” Fink said.

Title: Musk’s xAI startup swallows up X social network in surprise deal

Elon Musk said his xAI artificial intelligence startup has acquired the X platform, which he also controls, at a valuation of $33 billion, marking a surprise twist for the social network formerly known as Twitter.“The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion,” the billionaire wrote Friday in a post on X. The value of X is $45 billion when including $12 billion of debt, he said, describing the purchase as an all-stock transaction.The deal gives the new combined entity, called XAI Holdings, a value of more than $100 billion, not including the debt, according to a person familiar with the arrangement, who asked not to be identified because the terms weren’t public. Morgan Stanley was the sole banker on the deal, representing both sides, other people said.For Musk, the deal streamlines his businesses and solidifies the relationship between the former Twitter and xAI, which has used information from the social network to hone its chatbot. The deal also offers a resolution to X’s other backers following months of uncertainty over the state of their investment as Musk’s changes led to an exodus of users and advertisers.“XAI and X’s futures are intertwined,” Musk posted. “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach.”Musk, the world’s richest person, acquired Twitter for $44 billion in late 2022, a transaction that included debt. After taking control of the platform, he quickly moved to cut costs by slashing thousands of jobs, closing offices and renegotiating contracts. He also tried to make Twitter more aligned with what he calls “free speech absolutism” by eliminating certain content restrictions and allowing some banned accounts to return.But Musk also eroded a significant portion of the network’s advertising business in the process. Marketers fled the site for fear that their promoted posts would appear alongside unsavory content from users. Even with an expected boost in sales for 2025, X’s advertising business is still projected to be roughly half of what it was when Musk acquired the company.Over the past year, Musk has used the service to promote Grok, a chatbot developed by xAI that was trained, in part, with posts from X users. The startup is competing with AI firms such as OpenAI, which Musk co-founded before an acrimonious split with that company. “This helps integrate the system quite nicely,” said Shweta Khajuria, a Wolfe Research analyst who views the deal as a positive for both of Musk’s businesses. “This gives Grok a unique advantage” by providing access to vast amounts of training data while also allowing xAI to control — or even cut off — that data flow to other companies.Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management and an investor in both companies, wrote on X that the deal “makes a lot of sense” by giving xAI an in-house proprietary data set that other companies don’t have access to. “Grok brings the brains. X brings the distribution,” he posted. “OpenAI has the brains and brand distribution (e.g., Apple), but lacks X’s proprietary data. Long-term edge: xAI.”A spokesperson for X declined to comment, pointing Bloomberg to a post from X CEO Linda Yaccarino. “The future could not be brighter,” she wrote. It’s unclear whether this merger will affect her role as X’s CEO.Musk has a long history of blending his various operations by sharing investors, technology and employees. His AI business, in addition to training on X user data, has also shared office space with X in the San Francisco Bay area. X also amassed a $6 billion stake in xAI as of January, which further intertwined the businesses.Investors in xAI have included Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity Investments and BlackRock Inc. Some of the AI startup’s investors were also backers of X, including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia.Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh wrote Friday that xAI’s acquisition of X could set a framework for deals involving other social networking companies.The deal “might be a sign that rivals including OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity and Mistral will pursue deals to enhance their consumer reach and distribution,” Singh wrote. “We believe smaller social-media players will actively seek alliances with providers of large language models, given the premium valuation for xAI at $80 billion, which is more than the combined market values of Snap, Pinterest and Reddit.”For most of Musk’s tenure as X’s owner, the social networking company was believed to be valued well below the $44 billion that Musk paid in late 2022. Fidelity, for example, had marked down its equity stake in the company by more than 70% as recently as November.But X has seen a slight business resurgence since Musk became a top adviser to President Donald Trump, a relationship that has brought some advertisers back in an effort to curry favor with the two men. X raised close to $1 billion in new equity from investors, Bloomberg reported this month, in a deal that gave the company a valuation in line with when Musk took it private in 2022.Banks that had also been holding onto debt from Musk’s Twitter purchase were also finally able to offload it earlier this year without taking a loss. At one point in 2022, that debt was marked at 60 cents on the dollar by some firms.X is on pace for its first year of advertising revenue growth since the Musk takeover, though some of those marketers are believed to be returning out of fear that Musk may sue them. The company is projected to generate $1.31 billion in US advertising sales in 2025, an increase of 17.5%, according to research firm Emarketer. Globally, X’s ad sales are estimated to be $2.26 billion this year, up 16.5%. “The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion,” the billionaire wrote Friday in a post on X.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Amazon announced this week that Jennifer Salke is stepping down as the head of Amazon MGM Studios — a move that could indicate high-level dissatisfaction with the company’s streaming strategy over the past few years. To be clear, Salke’s boss, Mike Hopkins (the head of Amazon MGM Studios and Prime Video), praised her work in an email to employees and described her departure as one that allows the company to “flatten our leadership structure a bit” — a recurring theme in recent tech company layoffs. In other words, Amazon does not intend to fill Salke’s role. Instead, the heads of its film and TV studios will report directly to Hopkins. But the reporting around Salke’s departure highlights Amazon’s streaming disappointments and challenges under her leadership. Previously an exec at NBC, Salke joined Amazon Studios in 2018, as the company was looking to expand beyond critically praised movies and shows into more mainstream hits. The streamer has had its share of successes since then, including “Reacher,” “Jack Ryan,” “Fallout,” and “The Boys.” It also made a big bet on “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,” a show whose premiere drew a record audience for Amazon but has not proven to be the world-conquering phenomenon that you’d hope for with a reported budget of more than $1 billion. And then there’s “Citadel,” an espionage show designed as the epicenter of a fictional universe of global spinoffs like “Citadel: Diana” and “Citadel: Honey Bunny.” Extensive reshoots reportedly turned “Citadel” into the second most expensive show ever made (behind only “The Rings of Power”), but its reception has been even more underwhelming. The Hollywood Reporter says the second season has been delayed from fall 2025 to spring 2026, with further spinoffs put on hold. Amazon has also struggled to get another James Bond film into production, following its acquisition of MGM in 2022. Producers Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli (longtime Bond producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli was their father) maintained creative control of the franchise, and a Wall Street Journal report in December suggested that Barbara Broccoli was particularly unhappy with Amazon — she was apparently annoyed in an early meeting when Salke referred to Bond as “content,” and she was even reported to have described the tech giant’s team as “idiots.” Another source said that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was, in turn, so angered by the WSJ story about Broccoli that he declared, “I don’t care what it takes, get rid of her,” with the company subsequently paying Wilson and Broccoli to give up control. Salke’s name was noticeably missing from Amazon’s triumphant announcement of the Bond deal. She will, however, be starting a new film and TV production company with a first-look deal at Amazon.

March 29, 2025 14:33 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 29 March 2025 – Novo Nordisk today presented the full results from the SOUL cardiovascular outcomes trial, demonstrating that Rybelsus® (oral semaglutide) significantly reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD)1. These new data from the phase 3b trial were featured during a late-breaking clinical trial session at the American College of Cardiology's (ACC) Annual Scientific Session and Expo in Chicago, US and simultaneously published today in New England Journal of Medicine2. The SOUL trial achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating a 14% reduction in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in adults with type 2 diabetes and CVD and/or CKD when treated with Rybelsus® compared to placebo. Each component of MACE, being CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke, contributed to the risk reduction1. “Heart attacks and strokes are the leading causes of disability and death for people with type 2 diabetes, and there is a need for new, patient-centric treatments to help manage this risk,” said Darren McGuire, MD, Distinguished Chair in Cardiovascular Science and Teaching Professor of Medicine at UT Southwestern, US, and SOUL steering committee co-chair. “The SOUL trial in adults with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or CKD demonstrated significant reductions in the risk of major cardiovascular events including heart attack, stroke and CV death in those treated with oral semaglutide vs placebo. The proven cardiovascular benefit reflects a profound clinical impact for our patients who now have an oral option to improve health outcomes.” Cardiometabolic diseases span a wide range of conditions, including cardiovascular and peripheral artery disease, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease3. When combined, these conditions represent the leading cause of death globally4. Having type 2 diabetes directly increases the risk of developing interconnected cardiometabolic diseases, while also contributing to the progression of other cardiovascular risk factors5. Nearly one in three adults with type 2 diabetes have CVD6. “Novo Nordisk continues to evolve its focus beyond diabetes and obesity towards a broader spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “These data, alongside our other data being presented at ACC, reinforce the comprehensive set of health benefits of semaglutide, making it a strong option for healthcare professionals addressing the spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health – and our continued leadership in the space.” The overall safety profile of oral semaglutide in SOUL was consistent with that seen in previous semaglutide trials, and no new safety signals were observed. The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in participants receiving Rybelsus® than those receiving placebo, mostly due to the higher rate of cardiovascular events and infections in the placebo group. The most common SAEs were cardiac disorders (17.8% and 19.8%, respectively) and infections/infestations (15.0% and 16.5%, respectively) in the Rybelsus® and placebo arms1. In a key secondary analysis from SOUL published simultaneously, oral semaglutide reduced risk of MACE independently of baseline use of SGLT2i and suggests similar benefits in participants with and without concomitant SGLT2i use during trial7. SOUL confirmed the well-established safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide supported by long-term safety data with more than 33 million patient years8. Based on data from the SOUL clinical trial, Novo Nordisk submitted a label extension application for Rybelsus®, which has been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA. A decision is anticipated in 2025. About SOUL SOUL was a multicentre, international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial with 9,650 people enrolled. It was conducted to assess the effect of oral semaglutide vs placebo on cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes and established CVD and/or CKD. The SOUL trial was initiated in 2019. The key objective of SOUL was to demonstrate that oral semaglutide lowers the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite endpoint consisting of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke) compared to placebo, both added to standard of care in patients with type 2 diabetes and established CVD and/or CKD9,10. About Rybelsus®Rybelsus® (oral semaglutide) is a GLP-1 receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise11,12. Rybelsus® is administered once daily and is approved for use in three therapeutic dosages: 3 mg, 7 mg and 14 mg13,14. Rybelsus® offers superior blood glucose lowering vs Januvia® and Jardiance®13,14, together with consistent weight reduction13-15 and reduction in cardiometabolic risk factors15. Rybelsus® is currently commercially marketed in 45 countries. More than 2.1 million people with type 2 diabetes are currently being treated with Rybelsus® worldwide16.

REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Lewis Jackson and Jenny Su BEIJING, March 29 (Reuters) – Chinese state media attacked Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison’s plan to sell its ports near the Panama Canal to a BlackRock-led group in a social media post on Saturday that was taken down minutes later. The social media account linked to state broadcaster CCTV said China had significant national interests in the transaction and the sale was “tantamount to handing a knife to an opponent.” As a Hong Kong company, CK Hutchison should be careful about how it handled deals that could harm China’s national interest, said the post from the account Yuyuantantian on social media platform Weibo. However minutes after going live, the post had vanished. Whatever the reason for the post’s deletion, it highlights growing opposition to the deal in China, where the market regulator said on Friday it would review the transaction. Also on Friday, Reuters reported CK Hutchison had delayed part of the sale process, although sources said the deal has not been called off.

Title: These 100-Year-Old Funds Are Kicking Out Near-10% Dividends

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster Contributor. Different yield and maturities for bonds and interest on stock exchange screen. Over the last couple of years, we’ve seen a quiet trend in investing—and today we’re going to tap into it with two funds with near 10% dividends. That’s right: enough to pay you back just shy of 10% of your initial buy a year in dividends alone. What’s more, these two income plays—closed-end funds, to be precise—have been around for nearly a century, with one dating from 1927 and the other having launched in 1929. That last date, of course, is notorious, as it heralded the start of the worst market crash in history. I bring these two CEFs up now because their long institutional memory gives them a level of reliability that few other funds can match. And there’s something else that favors both of them now, too—that quiet shift I mentioned earlier. I’m talking about the move from growth stocks to value stocks that’s started to pick up momentum in recent months. We can catch a hint of that when we look at the performance of the large caps in the Dow Jones Industrial Average compared to small caps, as shown below by their benchmark index funds: the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA), in orange below, and the small-cap-focused iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), in purple: Large Caps Outperform That nicely sets the table for our two centenarian funds. The General American Investors Company is the oldest of our two CEFs, but not by much. It’s been around since 1927 and holds reliable cash cows like Republic Services (RSG), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A). The fund has delivered an annualized return of 8.9% over the past decade, as of this writing. It’s caught our attention now because, at my CEF Insider service, one of the things we look for is a fund with what I like to call “discount momentum.” That’s where a CEF’s discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the fund’s underlying portfolio) is still wide but is slowly moving toward par. And that’s the setup we have with GAM now. Take a look. GAM Discount to NAV Currently, GAM trades at a massive 13.3% discount, as you can see above, and that discount has been shrinking over the last year as market volatility prompts more investors to favor value over growth. In the past year, GAM has also paid out a 9.3% dividend, which is a massive amount of income for one fund. Now it is true, that most of the fund’s income is paid out in one big yearly special dividend, so you’ll have to hold on to the fund for a full year to be guaranteed the full payout. But that’s a good thing: At CEF Insider, we see funds as something to be held for the long term. Our second fund, the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX) was launched just a couple years after GAM, in 1929. That, of course, sent it headlong into the biggest market crash of them all, and the Great Depression. But that experience was the start of the fund’s build-up of the institutional memory that still helps guide its decisions today. That’s a big part of the reason why we bought ADX in one of our first issues of CEF Insider, back in July 2017. Since then, it has delivered a 193% total return for us, as of this writing, showing its long-term mettle. ADX and GAM take similar approaches, with Microsoft, Alphabet and Apple being common top positions, but ADX also has a large holding of NVIDIA (NVDA), which is part of the reason why the fund has posted a bigger “NAV return” (or the performance of its underlying portfolio, including dividends collected) over the last decade. (ADX’s total NAV return is in orange below.) ADX Outperforms GAM ADX’s strategy isn’t too risky, though, as it emphasizes investing in high-quality, large-cap companies, ensuring both growth potential and dividend reliability. Plus, its total dividend yield of 10.9% for 2024, combined with a relatively low management fee (for a CEF) of only 0.61%, makes ADX one of the cheaper CEFs on the fee front. On average, these funds have fees around 2% on average. What’s unusual about ADX is that it has outperformed the market over the last decade and, over the last couple of years, the gap between its profits and those of the S&P 500—shown by the performance of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), in orange below, has grown wider: ADX Outperforms SPY ADX should trade at a premium for delivering these gains, yet it sports at an 11.4% discount as I write this. That means there’s upside as this “secret” income monster becomes more widely known. The move from growth to value, which we discussed with GAM above, should also help ADX move on to more people’s radar. At this point, you might be wondering which fund is ideal: the cheaper GAM or the higher-performing ADX? Ultimately, what matters with CEFs is that we combine the best funds in different asset classes—and funds with different investment strategies—while maintaining a high level of quality among our picks. That way, when one falters due to a selloff, you can rebalance toward that dip-buying opportunity as another CEF outperforms. CEFs are particularly useful for this kind of rebalancing due to their high dividends (yields average around 8% as I write this). You’ll not only compound your returns by following this approach—you’ll build up a healthy income stream over time, too. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

March 29, 2025 10:33 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 29 March 2025 – Novo Nordisk today presented the full results from STRIDE, a phase 3b peripheral artery disease (PAD) outcomes trial investigating the effects of once-weekly injectable Ozempic® (semaglutide 1.0 mg) in adults with type 2 diabetes and PAD, at the American College of Cardiology's (ACC) Annual Scientific Session and Expo in Chicago, US1. These new data from the phase 3 trial were featured during a late-breaking clinical trial session at the ACC and simultaneously published today in The Lancet2. The double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled STRIDE trial achieved its primary endpoint, with semaglutide 1.0 mg demonstrating a superior and clinically meaningful improvement of 13% in maximum walking distance and a mean treatment difference of 39.9 meters on a steep incline, compared to placebo at week 52. The trial also demonstrated superiority to placebo for all confirmatory secondary outcomes assessed, including pain-free walking distance at week 52, health-related quality of life (Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire-6) at week 52, and maximum walking distance at week 571. “Peripheral artery disease (PAD) may cause severe symptoms, physical limitations, and a diminished quality of life, often making even short walks, such as retrieving the mail challenging. In individuals with PAD and diabetes, the disease can be even more severe, affecting small blood vessels and limiting the effectiveness of revascularization procedures and other treatments. Semaglutide 1.0 mg is the first medication in over two decades to show improvements in cardiometabolic and cardiovascular outcomes as well as meaningful improvements in functional capacity and quality of life, which could address a critical unmet need for those with both PAD and type 2 diabetes," said Marc P. Bonaca, MD, Director of Vascular Research, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Lead Investigator of the STRIDE trial. “The significant improvements in walking distance and patient-reported quality of life observed with semaglutide 1.0 mg in the STRIDE trial are promising and represent an important step forward on the path to advancing treatment options for this patient population.” PAD is a severe form of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease that is under-screened and underdiagnosed and impacts approximately 230 million people globally3. Type 2 diabetes is one of the leading risk factors for PAD, and nearly one in three people with PAD have type 2 diabetes4. There are limited therapies available to specifically improve functional limitations in PAD, representing a significant unmet need in this population5. “Novo Nordisk continues to evolve its focus beyond diabetes and obesity towards a broader spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “These data, alongside other data being presented at ACC, reinforce the comprehensive set of health benefits of semaglutide, making it a strong option for healthcare professionals addressing the spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health – and our continued leadership in the space.” The safety results from the STRIDE trial are consistent with the well-established safety and tolerability profile of once-weekly semaglutide1, supported by long-term safety data with more than 33 million patient-years of exposure6. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in fewer participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group (74 [19%] vs 78 [20%]). SAE probably related to treatment occurred in 2 participants (1%) in the semaglutide group and in 2 participants (1%) in the placebo group. SAE possibly related to treatment occurred in 3 (1%) and 4 (1%) participants, respectively. SAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation of semaglutide or placebo were less common in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group (11 [3%] vs 13 [3%]). SAEs led to the death of 3 (1%) and 8 (2%) participants in the semaglutide and placebo arms, respectively; however, no SAEs leading to death were treatment-related1. Based on data from the STRIDE clinical trial, Novo Nordisk submitted a label extension application for Ozempic® to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A decision is anticipated in 2025. About STRIDE STRIDE is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3b clinical trial assessing the benefit of once-weekly injectable semaglutide 1.0 mg, marketed as Ozempic®, on functional capacity. It enrolled 792 participants with type 2 diabetes and symptomatic PAD with walking-induced leg pain. The primary endpoint was maximum walking distance on a constant load treadmill for people treated with semaglutide compared to placebo at week 52. STRIDE is the only dedicated PAD functional outcomes trial with a GLP-1 RA. About PADLower extremity PAD is a severe form of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The classical symptom is intermittent claudication, associated with limited walking ability and poor health-related quality of life7. Type 2 diabetes is one of the leading risk factors for PAD; nearly one in three people with PAD have type 2 diabetes4.

Business FILE PHOTO: The company logo of CK Hutchison Holdings is displayed at a news conference in Hong Kong, China March 17, 2016. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo BEIJING: Chinese state media attacked Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison's plan to sell its ports near the Panama Canal to a BlackRock-led group in a social media post on Saturday (Mar 29) that was taken down minutes later. The social media account linked to state broadcaster CCTV said China had significant national interests in the transaction and the sale was "tantamount to handing a knife to an opponent." As a Hong Kong company, CK Hutchison should be careful about how it handled deals that could harm China's national interest, said the post from the account Yuyuantantian on social media platform Weibo. However minutes after going live, the post had vanished. Whatever the reason for the post's deletion, it highlights growing opposition to the deal in China, where the market regulator said on Friday it would review the transaction. Also on Friday, Reuters reported CK Hutchison had delayed part of the sale process, although sources said the deal has not been called off.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 29 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 29 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 29 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade.

It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: Meet The Other Billionaire Behind The Winning Bid For The Boston Celtics

ByGiacomo Tognini ByGiacomo Tognini Forbes Staff. Bruce Beal Jr. When the owners of the NBA’s Boston Celtics announced on March 20 that they were selling the team for $6.1 billion to a group of investors led by private equity executive William “Bill” Chisholm, the news shocked the sports world. Few even knew who Bill Chisholm was, though they quickly learned he went to his first Celtics game on his seventh birthday and had been a “rabid fan ever since” who “bleeds green.” But Chisholm isn’t the only die-hard billionaire fan buying into the Celtics for the first time. Boston native Bruce Beal Jr., a partner at real estate giant Related Companies, joined Chisholm and telecom billionaire Robert Hale in the deal. “I grew up in Boston, loving the Celtics," Beal said in a statement. Recalling the day he saw the Celtics win the 1984 NBA finals, he said “it was the best day ever. Fast forward to today, it’s come full circle.” At least one well-known person in sports was not surprised. NFL great Tom Brady congratulated Beal on his Instagram story shortly after the deal was announced. “The Boston boy is an owner of his Boston team,” he wrote, adding three fire emojis. “Congratulations Bruce Beal Jr.!!!” (Celtic punk rock band Dropkick Murphys' “I'm Shipping Up To Boston” provided the soundtrack for the post.) The Celtics investment, if it’s approved, won’t be Beal’s first foray into pro sports. The 55-year-old already owns a minority stake in the NFL’s Miami Dolphins, where he serves as vice chairman and was brought in after Related’s founder Stephen Ross bought a 95% stake in the team in 2009 at a $1.1 billion valuation. The Dolphins were valued at $8.1 billion (along with the Hard Rock Stadium, Formula 1’s Miami Grand Prix and the Miami Open tennis tournament) when Ross sold a 13% stake last December. Forbes estimates Beal’s minority stake in the Dolphins is worth more than $100 million. Outside of his NFL bet, Beal owes most of his fortune to Related, the New York-based real estate developer founded by Ross in 1972. Beal joined the firm in 1995 and rose to become president in 2012. Forbes estimates Beal is worth more than $1 billion. A representative for Related Companies declined to comment on the net worth estimate or to make Beal available for an interview. Bruce Beal Jr. (left) and his father Bruce Beal Sr. (right) at the preview celebration for The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards in New York in 2019. Beal grew up in Boston in a real estate dynasty. His father, Bruce Sr., was the fourth generation of the family to run Boston-based property developer the Beal Companies, which was first established in 1878 by Beal Jr.’s great-great-grandfather Abraham Beal. As a child, Beal had different plans, telling Crain's New York in 2009 that he originally wanted to become the next Jacques Cousteau, going to marine biology camps and working at a fish market in Nantucket and a dolphin lab in Hawaii. He was also a rabid Celtics fan. “When I was 16, the Celtics were going public and I proudly used the money I made from summer landscaping to buy about 20 shares,” he said in a statement. “It was the first stock purchase I ever made.” After going public in 1986, the team delisted from the stock exchange in 2003 when it was purchased for $360 million by a group of investors led by Irving Grousbeck, whose family will retain a stake in the franchise until the second part of the $6.1 billion sale closes in 2028. Beal graduated from high school in 1988 at Concord Academy, a tony prep school in an affluent Boston suburb, and then went to Harvard, where he got a bachelor's of arts and was on the lightweight crew team. Two years after graduating from Harvard in 1993, he started working at Related. In 2003, he led Related’s joint venture with his father’s company to develop the Clarendon and One Back Bay, two apartment buildings with a combined 281 units in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. The apartments were completed in 2009, and four years later Beal Companies merged with Related to form Related Beal, which is now Related’s division in Boston. (Bruce Beal Sr. serves as Related Beal's chairman.) In 2007, Ross sold a 7.5% stake in Related to Goldman Sachs and Michael Dell’s MSD Capital. (MSD Capital later merged with Byron Trott’s merchant bank to form BDT & MSD Partners, run by Trott and Greg Lemkau, a former teammate of Bill Chisholm’s on Dartmouth’s varsity soccer team and also a Goldman Sachs alum. That firm was an advisor on the Celtics sale.) A year later, Ross bought 50% of the Miami Dolphins—plus the stadium and surrounding land—from billionaire Wayne Huizenga (d. 2018) for $550 million, buying another 45% stake in 2009 at a $1.1 billion valuation. By 2016, Beal had become a minority investor, and CBS Sports reported that the NFL had approved a succession plan with Ross granting Beal the right of first option to buy the Dolphins if Ross died or decided to sell his majority stake. In 2022, Ross reportedly changed his mind, giving that right to his daughter Jennifer instead. Bruce Beal Jr. (left), Jeff Blau (center) and Stephen Ross (right) in Hudson Yards in 2019, with the 150-foot tall Vessel behind them. Together with Ross and Related’s current CEO, Jeff Blau, Beal helped build Related Companies into a behemoth that’s developed or acquired $70 billion worth of residential, retail, office, hospitality and data center properties across the U.S., London and Abu Dhabi. “The company started in affordable housing, then we did market-rate rentals, and we built offices for companies like Nestlé and MasterCard,” Beal told Forbes in 2023, pointing to its diversification across different types of real estate. “We're very customer-driven, so we're constantly thinking about what our customers want.” But Beal didn’t just ride Ross’ coattails. Ross handed off day-to-day operations to Beal and Blau in 2012, appointing them as president and CEO, respectively. Ross used to tell the pair “‘I'm going to give you a really long leash, just don't hang yourself,'" Beal told Forbes in 2019. The trio worked together on many of Related’s largest projects, including Hudson Yards, a neighborhood on Manhattan's west side with 12 million square feet of offices, apartments and retail that cost $25 billion to build and opened in 2019. Despite a downturn in New York’s office market during the Covid-19 pandemic, Hudson Yards has been a success, with its office buildings now 98% occupied by tenants including BlackRock, Facebook parent Meta, Wells Fargo and L’Oréal. “From a developer standpoint, you have to execute every day. We not only have to get the buildings built, we have to run them,” Beal told Forbes in 2023. “So we're constantly thinking about what we can do better and evolve as the markets change.” Then in July 2024, Ross stepped down as executive chairman and left to form a separate company, Related Ross, in Palm Beach, Florida; he still holds a stake in the company and remains the firm’s non-executive chairman. Beal and Blau are now pushing ahead with new developments, including a proposed $12 billion makeover of the unfinished railyards west of Hudson Yards, called Hudson Yards West, that would include a Wynn Resorts casino if it wins one of the New York state gaming licenses up for grabs in December. The project will also have office space, residential buildings, a public school and a 5.6 acre park. Unlike his partner Ross—who’s decamped to Florida—Beal is bullish on New York. “People still want to be in New York. It'll cycle through and it always comes back,” Beal told Forbes in 2023. “We felt like if we did our job and put our heads down and executed, people would not only want to be in New York, but be in Hudson Yards." Still, the longtime New York resident maintains ties to Boston. He owns at least two homes in Related developments in the city and one of his children goes to school there. Now Beal will have an extra reason to find the time to go home to watch the Celtics. “[Boston] still feels like home,” Beal said in a statement. “I love the Celtics and I am honored to be a part of this incredible organization that means so much to Boston and fans like me, who grew up loving this team.”

Elon Musk has announced that his artificial intelligence startup, xAI, has acquired social media platform X (formerly Twitter) in a deal worth $45 billion. This acquisition, which includes $ 12 billion in debt, slightly surpasses the $44 billion Musk paid for Twitter in 2022 before rebranding it as X. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO shared the news of the acquisition on his X account, stating, “xAI and X's futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, computing, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI's advanced AI capability and expertise with X's massive reach.” What is Musk's xAI startup? Elon Musk founded xAI in 2023 with the vision of developing cutting-edge artificial intelligence models capable of competing with industry giants such as OpenAI, Google and Microsoft. Shortly after its launch, xAI introduced Grok, an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide real-time responses and engage with users in a conversational manner. Over time, Grok became an integral part of X, with users frequently using it to participate in discussions, seek information and generate insights, according to a report in NBC News. To improve its AI models, xAI has used data from social media interactions on X, refining Grok's ability to respond contextually and intelligently. This integration between xAI's technology and X's vast user-generated content has positioned Grok as a prominent and widely used feature on the platform. Amid the growing demand for AI-driven technologies, xAI has attracted significant interest from investors. Major Wall Street firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley and Sequoia Capital, along with leading semiconductor giants Nvidia and AMD, invested in xAI in December 2024, pushing its valuation to $45 billion, the NBC News report said. More recently, the company secured an additional $10 billion in funding, further driving its valuation to an impressive $75 billion, according to a report in The Guardian. With expansion and growing investor confidence, xAI is solidifying its position as a major player in the AI landscape. Its acquisition of X could mark a big step in that direction. What is the future of xAI and X? While Elon Musk has not yet announced any immediate changes to X following its acquisition by xAI, he has hinted at a deeper integration of artificial intelligence into the platform. The deal, structured as an all-stock transaction, values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, accounting for $12 billion in debt. Musk described xAI as one of the world's fastest-growing AI labs, highlighting its rapid advancements in developing AI models and building data centres at an unprecedented scale. At the same time, the Tesla CEO emphasised X's transformation into a highly efficient company, now serving as the “digital town square” for over 600 million active users. He believes this acquisition positions the platform for scalable growth, using xAI's AI capabilities to improve user experiences and interactions. He reiterated xAI's core mission of “seeking truth and advancing knowledge.” Musk expressed gratitude to the teams at xAI and X for their dedication, calling this acquisition “just the beginning.” He also acknowledged the continued support of partners and investors.

Global Times By Global Times Published: Mar 28, 2025 09:38 PM China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it will review CK Hutchison's Panama Canal ports deal in accordance with laws to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests, according to a Q&A release conducted by Hong Kong Ta Kung Wen Wei (HKTKWW) Media with the market regulator published on its official website. The question raised by Hong Kong Ta Kung Wen Wei said that it is reported that Hutchison Ports, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings, is expected to sign a transaction agreement with BlackRock on April 2 regarding the sale and whether the proposed transaction would require regulatory approval in China. A spokesperson from the second antitrust enforcement division of the State Administration for Market Regulation said that "We have noted this deal and will conduct a review in accordance with the law to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests." According to information on the official website of the SAMR, the second antitrust enforcement division of the SAMR is responsible for antitrust review of businesses' concentration of undertakings. It is also responsible for investigating and addressing illegal concentrations of undertakings, as well as those concentrations that, despite not meeting the notification thresholds, may eliminate or restrict competition. The division also provides guidance to Chinese enterprises on antitrust compliance in overseas markets. The potential sale of Hutchison Ports' Panama assets is attracting attention due to the strategic significance of port infrastructure and the involvement of a major US investment firm, according to the HKTKWW report. CK Hutchison said earlier this month that it agreed to sell most of the global $22.8 billion ports business, including assets it holds along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock. In total, the consortium will control 43 ports in 23 countries, according to Reuters. When asked about CK Hutchison's sale of its overseas ports business, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Thursday that China firmly opposes moves that infringe on and undermine other countries' legitimate rights and interests through economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying.

Title: Italy v Ireland: Injury-free Aoibheann Reilly to start as Irish side look for rare win on the road

Resilience is an important character trait for any sportsperson, one that Ireland scrumhalf Aoibheann Reilly has displayed in battling back from not one but two ACL surgeries, one on each knee. The 24-year-old from Ballinasloe made her return to Test rugby off the bench in Ireland’s defeat to France last weekend. On Sunday in Parma she’ll start, forming a halfback partnership with Dannah O’Brien. Reilly tore the ACL in her right knee three years ago. The second time was while playing Sevens for Ireland in Madrid in the build-up to the Olympics, shattering a dream. While the injuries were the same the rehabilitation process differed from a mindset perspective. She explained: “First time around I was 21 and hadn’t played a whole lot for Ireland. So, I don’t know if I had that pressure on me to go back. “My rehab process was a bit longer, but this is a World Cup year, and I knew I needed to get back and get game time under my belt, especially after spending so long in Sevens. I was very focused, worked with some great physios to get me back fit and ready to perform. “It was a very emotional moment standing there for the anthems [last week in Belfast]. When I tore my ACL for the second time, before the Olympics last summer, I was just focusing on getting back for that France game. I knew that everything had to go right in my rehab journey to get back on the pitch, so it was a big moment for me and my family just wearing the green again.” She returned to the match arena in a little over eight months, the second time, playing a couple of games for the Clovers in the Celtic Challenge, which facilitated her return to the Irish team. During that absence she did come co-comms for television, European Challenge Cup games, and also was given a backroom role with Andy Farrell’s men’s squad. She said: “I was very lucky to have been asked to join the men’s team for the November internationals as a support analyst. It was a great way for me to develop my knowledge off-pitch, see how they run things and then also keep learning and growing my rugby IQ while I couldn’t be on-field. That was such a valuable experience and I’m very grateful to the IRFU and to the men’s squad for that. “While I was rehabbing here in HPC I would tailor my days with my physio so I could be there for their big pitch sessions and then I headed over to Portugal for a few days for their pre-camp, which was great. I also shadowed a bit on matchday which was a great insight.” Did she pick up any tips? “Just the way they operate, similar to us, they’re obviously professionals but it was interesting to see how they do things on matchday that are different but also similar to us. Just the level of experience they have in their squad and how they use that, seeing that was very valuable.” Reilly is one of three changes to the team that lost 27-15 to France last week. Ireland head coach Scott Bemand promotes Fiona Tuite, Edel McMahon – she takes over the captaincy – and Reilly from the bench with Dorothy Wall, Brittany Hogan and Emily Lane heading in the opposite direction. Italian head coach Fabio Roselli has made six changes to the side that was beaten 38-5 by England on the opening weekend of the tournament. Hooker Vittoria Vecchini, Gaia Maris, Sara Tounesi and Emma Stevanin swap the bench for a starting role, while number eight Elisa Giordano and centre Michela Sillari are the other alterations to the run-on team. There are a couple of positional switches with Alyssa D’Inca moving from centre to wing, Francesca Granzotto from wing to fullback and Francesca Sgorbini from number eight to flanker. Italy are looking for a hat-trick of wins over Ireland in the Six Nations, having won just one of the previous 16 matches between the sides. Ireland have lost 10 of their last 11 away games, including the previous seven, a streak they’d dearly love to break. There were aspects of the Irish performance last week that were promising but what can’t continue is the number of basic errors. Getting players on the ball like Aoife Wafer, Amee-Leigh Costigan, Stacey Flood, Linda Djougang, Aoife Dalton, Erin King who can break a game open is important but so too is a progression in quality in terms of the collective output. Do that and anything is possible. Italy: F Granzotto; A Muzzo, M Sillari, B Rigoni, A D’Inca; E Stevanin, S Stefan; S Turani, V Vecchini, G Maris; V Fedrighi, G Duca; S Tounesi, F Sgorbini, E Giordano.

Title: AI: The New Aesthetics of Fascism

Time Published: 2025-03-29T05:47:01Z

New Socialist. February 9, 2025 Gareth Watkins It's embarrassing, destructive, and looks like shit: AI-generated art is the perfect aesthetic form for the far right. 15 min read Tommy Robinson tweets an image of soldiers walking into the ocean on D-Day. Britain First’s co-leader produces imagery of Muslim men laughing at sad white girls on public transport. An AI-generated song combining kitsch schlager pop with crude racial stereotypes makes it into the German top fifty and becomes number three on Spotify’s global viral chart. Benjamin Netanyahu conjures a vision of an ethnically-cleansed Gaza connected by bullet train to the equally ephemeral Neom. Keir Starmer’s Labour Party posts, then is forced to take down, a video of its policies as embodied by anthropomorphic animals. A few days later, they promised to “mainline AI into the veins” of Britain. The right loves AI-generated imagery. In a short time, a full half of the political spectrum has collectively fallen for the glossy, disturbing visuals created by generative AI. Despite its proponents having little love, or talent, for any form of artistic expression, right wing visual culture once ranged from memorable election-year posters to ‘terrorwave’. Today it is slop, almost totally. Why? To understand it, we must consider the right’s hatred of working people, its (more than) mutual embrace of the tech industry and, primarily, its profound rejection of Enlightenment humanism. The last might seem like a stretch, but bear with me. The first point is the most obvious. ‘AI’ – as embodied by large language models like ChatGPT, and largely diffusion-based image generators like DALL-E and Midjourney – promises to make anyone who can write a single-paragraph prompt into a copywriter or graphic designer; jobs generally associated with young, educated, urban, and often left-leaning workers. That even the best AI models are not fit to be used in any professional context is largely irrelevant. The selling point is that their users don’t have to pay (and, more importantly, interact with) a person who is felt to be beneath them, but upon whose technical skills they’d be forced to depend. For relatively small groups like Britain First, hiring a full-time graphic designer to keep up with its insatiable lust for images of crying soldiers and leering foreigners would clearly be an unjustifiable expense. But surely world leaders, capable of marshalling vast state resources, could afford at the very least to get someone from Fiverr? Then again, why would they do even that, when they could simply use AI, and thus signal to their base their utter contempt for labour? For its right wing adherents, the absence of humans is a feature, not a bug, of AI art. Where mechanically-produced art used to draw attention to its artificiality – think the mass-produced modernism of the Bauhaus (which the Nazis repressed and the AfD have condemned), or the music of Kraftwerk – AI art pretends to realism. It can produce art the way right wingers like it: Thomas Kinkade paintings, soulless Dreamworks 3D cartoons, depthless imagery that yields only the reading that its creator intended. And, vitally, it can do so without the need for artists. Javier Milei, a prodigious user of AI-generated art, wants Argentinians to know that any of them could join the 265,000, mostly young people who have lost jobs as a result of the recession that he induced, to the rapturous praise of economic elites. He wants to signal that anyone can find themselves at the wrong end of his chainsaw, even if doing so means producing laughably bad graphics for the consumption of his 5.9 million deeply uncritical Instagram followers. On the subject of Instagram, anyone old enough to read this will also be old enough to remember when Mark Zuckerberg, and by extension the rest of Silicon Valley, was broadly perceived as liberal. ‘Zuck’ was even touted as the only presidential candidate who could beat Donald Trump. (It’s worth noting that as Zuckerberg has drifted to the right he has also started dressing badly, a fact which we will return to later.) But even Zuck can’t make AI happen. The weird AI-powered fake profiles that Meta deployed in 2023 were quietly mothballed six months later, and would have disappeared from history completely, had Bluesky users not found some that had escaped deletion. This appears to be the fate of all commercial AI projects: at best, to be ignored but tolerated, when bundled with something that people actually need (cf: Microsoft’s Co-pilot); at worst, to fail entirely because the technology just isn’t there. Companies can’t launch a new AI venture without their customers telling them, clearly, “nobody wants this.” And yet they persist. Why? Class solidarity. The capitalist class, as a whole, has made a massive bet on AI: $1 trillion dollars, according to Goldman Sachs – a figure calculated before the Trump administration pledged a further $500 billion for its ‘Project Stargate’. While previous bets on the Metaverse and NFTs didn’t pay off, their bet on cryptocurrency has paid off spectacularly – $3.44 trillion dollars, at the time of writing, have been created, effectively out of thin air. All of the above technologies had heavy buy-in from the political right: Donald Trump co-signed an NFT project and a memecoin; the far-right, shut out of conventional banking, uses cryptocurrency almost exclusively. This isn’t just about utility, it’s about aligning themselves with the tech industry. The same is true of their adoption of AI. OpenAI is unable to make money on $200 subscriptions to ChatGPT. Goldman Sachs cannot see any justification for its level of investment. Sam Altman is subject to allegations of sexually abusing his sister. ‘Slop’ was very nearly word of the year. And then, to top it all off, the open-source DeepSeek project, developed in China, wiped $1 trillion off the US stock market overnight. In other words, the AI industry now finds that it needs all the allies it can get. And it can’t afford to be picky. If the only places that people are seeing AI imagery is @BasedEphebophile1488’s verified X account – well, at least it’s being used at all. The thinking seems to be that, if it can hang on long enough in the public consciousness, then, like cryptocurrency before it, AI will become ‘too big to fail’. Political actors like Tommy Robinson won’t be the ones to make that call, but they can normalise its use, and Robinson certainly moves in the digital circles of people who can offer the AI industry far more concrete help. Just as we might donate to a GoFundMe, the capitalist class will provide mutual aid in the form of billions in investment, adding AI to their products, and attempting to normalise AI by using it. This process of normalisation has led to the putatively centre-left Labour government pledging vast sums to AI infrastructure. If one of the key features of the Starmerite tendency is their belief that only conservative values are truly legitimate, their embrace of AI and its aesthetics may be part of this. We have seen how sensitive the tech industry’s leaders are to criticism. Marc Andreessen’s techno-optimist manifesto, when not conferring sainthood upon deeply evil figures like Nick Land, largely consists of its writer begging the world to love him. Mark Zuckerberg’s recent interview with Joe Rogan featured lengthy sections on how he does not feel validated by the press and governments. Just as when they reach out to ‘cancelled’ celebrities, the right is now proactively creating an alliance with the tech industry by communicating that, even if they can’t materially support companies like OpenAI, they can at least offer emotional support. We may all be good materialists, but we can’t underestimate the effects that non-material support has in creating networks within capital. No amount of normalisation and ‘validation’, however, can alter the fact that AI imagery looks like shit. But that, I want to argue, is its main draw to the right. If AI was capable of producing art that was formally competent, surprising, soulful, then they wouldn’t want it. They would be repelled by it. There was a time when reactionaries were able to create great art – Dostoyevsky, G.K Chesterton, Knut Hamsun, and so on – but that time has long passed. Decades of seething hatred of the humanities have left them unable to create, or even think about, art. Art has always been in a dialectical push and pull between tradition and the avant garde: ‘art is when there is a realistic picture of a landscape, or a scene from Greek mythology’ versus ‘a urinal can be art if an artist signs it’. The goal of the avant-garde, as their name suggests, has been to expand art’s territory, to show that Rothko’s expanses of colour, or Ono’s instructional paintings, can do what Vermeer’s portraits can, and do it just as well. There was even a time when the right partook in this, the Italian Futurists being a prime example. There were, at one point, writers like Céline and artists like Wyndham Lewis, who not only produced great work, but developed and pushed forward the avant-garde styles of their day. Are there any serious artists on the right today who do not parlay in nostalgia for some imagined time before art was ‘ruined’ by Jews, women, and homosexuals? Perhaps only Michel Houellebecq, and he is long past his two-book prime. Art has rules – like the rules of the physical universe they are sufficiently flexible to allow both Chopin and Merzbow to be classed as music, but they exist, and even internet memes are subject to those rules. The most burnt-out shitpost is still part of a long tradition of outsider sloganeering stretching back through 60s comix to Dada and Surrealism. They aren’t nothing, and if they’re ugly then, often, they’re ugly in an interesting, generative way. A person made them ugly, and did so with intent. No matter how deeply avant-garde art has engaged in shock and putative nihilism, no artist, to my knowledge, has ever made art with the sole aim of harming the already vulnerable. Even the most depraved Power Electronics acts or the most shocking performances of the Viennese Actionists had something more to them than simply causing suffering for its own sake. Andy Warhol’s mass-produced art did not create enjoyment by enabling its viewers to imagine their class enemies being made unemployed. Those are the goals of AI art, and that is why it resonates with the right. If art is the establishing or breaking of aesthetic rules, then AI art, as practiced by the right, says that there are no rules but the naked exercise of power by an in-group over an out-group. It says that the only way to enjoy art is in knowing that it is hurting somebody. That hurt can be direct, targeted at a particular group (like Britain First’s AI propaganda), or it can be directed at art itself, and by extension, anybody who thinks that art can have any kind of value. It can often be playful – in the way that the cruel children of literary cliché play at pulling the wings off flies – and ironised; Musk’s Nazi salute partook of a tradition of ironic-not-ironic appropriation of fascist iconography that winds its way through 4Chan (Musk’s touchpoint) and back into the countercultural far right of the 20th century. I would not be the first to observe that we are in a new phase of reaction, something probably best termed ‘postmodern conservatism’. The main effect of this shift has been to enshrine acting like a spoilt fifteen-year-old boy as the organising principle of the reactionary movement. Counter-enlightenment thought, going back to Burke and de Maistre, has been stripped of any pretence of being anything but a childish tantrum backed up by equally childish, playground-level bullying. It is, and has always been, “irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas,” and to ‘post-liberal’ ‘intellectuals’, that is in fact a good thing – if anything, they believe, the postmodern right needs to become more absurd; it needs to abandon Enlightenment ideals like reason and argumentation altogether.1 The right wing intellectual project is simply to ask: ‘what would have to be true in order to justify the terrible things that I want to do?’ The right wing aesthetic project is to flood the zone – unsurprisingly, given their scatological bent, with bullshit – in order to erode the intellectual foundations for resisting political cruelty. Truth does not set you free. Once you know that 2+2=4, that the administrative capital of the Netherlands is The Hague and not Amsterdam, or that immigration is a net economic positive for Britain, then you are forever bound to that truth. Your world has become, in some respects, smaller, your options diminished. If it would be more enjoyable – because this is, at the end of the day, about enjoyment – to create your own truth then you are out of luck. Combine truths with a concern for human life and thriving, and suddenly rules start to proliferate: we have established the truth that heating milk reduces the bacteria and viruses in it that can harm human beings, which is undesirable to us, therefore we must heat all milk that is sold. A lot of people are fine with this, accepting small impositions on their freedom in the name of the greater freedom from disease. Some are not. There is no reason, of course, that any rule made in the name of Enlightenment humanism should be necessarily good: liberal politics, Labour’s current mania for austerity, or the interminable justifications for the Iraq war, are often framed as being based on reason and humanism while being anything but. If you’ve been subject to computer-says-no rules governing your access to the basic necessities of life, then you’ll know how easy it is to disguise arbitrary and highly politicised whims as laws of nature, as ironclad as A = π r². The application of rationality and compassion in the real world brings to mind the (likely apocryphal) Ghandi quote about Western civilisation: “I think it would be a good idea.” The right is a libidinal formation; it is, for many of its proponents, especially those who aren’t wealthy enough to materially benefit from it, a structure in which to have fun. A hobby, almost. Sartre’s injunction to remember that antisemites are primarily “amusing themselves”2 is true of most – perhaps all – right wing discourse, no matter how serious it seems or how terrible its real-world effects. As such, the right are strongly averse to any sort of reality-testing. It is, to them, beside the point whether anything they say stands up to the tests developed by the sciences and humanities, including those which determine (insofar as such a determination can be made) whether a piece of art is ‘good’, or at least serious. When they do invoke objectivity, it is misplaced, and as deeply naïve as their artistic output, premising their objection to the existence of trans people on ‘basic biology’, when not only can biology not define ‘woman’, it is having difficulty deciding what a fish or vegetable is. Serious engagement with the world as it is – with the facts that emphatically don’t care about your feelings – doesn’t often, if ever, yield the simple explanations that the right require. In the face of this complexity, most people will conclude that it is best to be humble: What is a woman? No idea, don’t really care, but let’s act in a way that causes the least suffering. But the right seem incapable of doing this. Despite all their absurdist posturing, they struggle to come to terms with a contradictory world that does not conform to their pre-decided categories. They want to assert, simultaneously, that unambiguous laws govern all aspects of being, while acting as though ‘truth’ is whatever they want or need it to be at any given moment. Gender revanchism is one of the main organising principles of the postmodern right, and much everyday AI usage demonstrates a particularly gendered form of cruelty: deepfake nudes, AI ‘girlfriends’ used as a rhetorical cudgel to show real women that they are being replaced, AI ‘art’ of Taylor Swift being sexually assaulted. It’s no coincidence that the internet’s largest directory of deepfakes uses Donald Trump as a mascot. These attitudes are reflected in the upper echelons of the tech and AI industry. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman – the man we are being told is a generational talent, a revolutionary, on a par with Steve Jobs or Bill Gates – is also, allegedly, a rapist and paedophile, who considered his own sister his sexual property since she was three years old, and who responded to allegations by lamenting that “caring for a family member who faces mental health challenges is incredibly difficult.” A love of sexual violence is a key part of the identity of the contemporary right, and it is no coincidence that, the further right one goes, the more likely one is to encounter open celebration of rape and, particularly, paedophilia. Altman’s legal trouble will, for many on the right, only confirm that he is one of them. Meanwhile, on the Joe Rogan podcast, Mark Zuckerberg described the tech industry as “culturally neutered” and called for more “masculine energy” and “aggression”. Let’s return to Zuckerberg’s clothing. It was he that established the ubiquitous ‘grey hoodie’ style for tech CEOs. But recently he has begun to exhibit a new style. Oversized t-shirts emblazoned with ‘It’s either Zuck or Nothing’ in Latin, the unwieldy lines of his Meta AI glasses, a gaudy and unnecessary gold chain. This isn’t taking risks with fashion, like Rick Owens or Vivienne Westwood. It’s just ugly and stupid. Zuckerberg is also significantly more muscular than he used to be, despite doing nothing in his life that would seem to require a bodybuilder physique. I don’t think that it’s a coincidence that, as he embraces corporate incelism and AI, he has felt liberated to ignore what does and doesn’t look good, choosing instead to display that he is wealthy and powerful enough to look terrible if he wants. All the emperor has to do, when the child laughs at his nudity, is ignore them. Trump’s haircut, which we all seem to have become inured to, serves the same purpose. It looks like shit and that’s the point. It is a display of power and a small act of cruelty. AI is a cruel technology. It replaces workers, devours millions of gallons of water, vomits CO2 into the atmosphere, propagandises exclusively for the worst ideologies, and fills the world with more ugliness and stupidity. Cruelty is the central tenet of right wing ideology. It is at the heart of everything they do. They are now quite willing to lose money or their lives in order to make the world a crueller place, and AI is a part of this – a mad rush to make a machine god that will liberate capital from labour for good. (This is no exaggeration: there is a lineage from OpenAI’s senior management back to the Lesswrong blog, originator of the concept of Roko’s Basilisk.) Moreso even than cryptocurrency, AI is entirely nihilistic, with zero redeeming qualities. It is a blight upon the world, and it will take decades to clear up the mountains of slop it has generated in the past two or three years. AI is, unfortunately, a fever that will have to burn itself out. It may be the case that, like cryptocurrency, elites are simply so invested in this technology that, despite its total lack of utility, they will keep trying to make it happen. Given how great a fit it is for them psychologically, I would say that this is more likely to happen than not. However, as we saw in those two brief weeks of last year’s US election campaign, the right wing psyche is incredibly fragile. For some reason, they are able to process any inversion of empirical reality, but are acutely sensitive to being laughed at. Calling them weird absolutely works, and telling them their sole artistic output looks like shit also works. Laughing at people who treat AI art as in any way legitimate works. Talking about AI’s environmental impact or its implications for the workforce will not work - they like that, it makes them feel dangerous. Instead of talking about taking money from artists, talk about how it makes them look cheap. If hurting and offending people is part of the point, then we can take that fun away from them by refusing to express hurt or offence, even if we feel it. Technological progress isn’t linear, and it’s not wholly undemocratic. We, ordinary people, stopped Google Glass from being widely released because we mocked its users, calling them ‘glassholes’. The Cybertruck – itself a work of anti-art that could only be the product of a mind addled by the far right – failed, largely because it is embarrassing to be seen in one. We have already seen that the AI industry is vulnerable – it was possible for Chinese grad students to build the same thing for a fraction of the price, calling into question the entire model of growth through massive investment in data centres. The left is powerless across much of society, but a training in ruthless criticism of all that exists has made us masters of negativity, while always keeping one eye on the better world that is possible when the slop has been cleared away. Our most effective weapons against AI, and the right wing that has adopted it, may not be strikes, boycotts or the power of dialectics. They might be replying “cringe,” “this sucks,” and “this looks like shit.” There are, of course, important left critiques of those values, and of the European Enlightenment project itself. These are not the same as the revanchism of the right. ↩ Jean-Paul Sartre. [1948] 1995. Anti-Semite and Jew. Translated by George J Becker. New York: Schocken, p.20.

Title: Panama Ports Deal on the Verge of Falling Apart Because of Chinese Government Opposition

Posted on 03/28/2025 9:42:57 PM PDT by SeekAndFind The Chinese government has intervened to stop the planned April 2 sale of two Panama Canal ports owned by the Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchinson to the US-based conglomerate Black Rock. CK Hutchinson operates two of the five ports adjacent to the Panama Canal. Panama first awarded the company the concession to run the ports in 1998 and extended it for another 25 years in 2021. The Canal is a major maritime chokepoint and manages about 3% of the global maritime trade. The issue of Chinese ownership of critical ports serving the Panama Canal predates President Trump's second term; see Does China Run the Canal? – RedState. The administration launched a full-court diplomatic press that got Panama to withdraw from China's Belt and Road Initiative; see UPDATED: Trump Admin. Lays Down the Law Over Panama Canal, Sets Up Major Confrontation; Panama Folds – RedState and Panama Capitulates - Will Not Renew 2017 Deal With China. What's Next? – RedState. That led to an agreement by CK Hutchinson to sell its Panama facilities to Black Rock. This seemed like an early diplomatic win for President Trump; see China's Out: American Company Taking Control of Panama Canal Ports – RedState.Selling the Canal ports did not prove as popular in Beijing as in Washington. Over the past two weeks, pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao has published a series of commentaries criticising the deal for harming China's national interests and depicting it as a betrayal of China and is a "perfect cooperation" with the U.S. strategy to contain China.China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted some of the commentaries on its website, which fueled speculation Beijing could take steps to try to scupper the sale.China's President Xi Jinping is reportedly angry about the deal. He saw Chinese ownership of the ports as a poke in the eye of American power and a bargaining chip in possible tariff negotiations.Now, Chinese antitrust regulators (yes, I did lol writing that) have been unleashed on the deal, which is much larger than two Panamanian ports.The sale of CK Hutchison’s two ports at each end of the Panama Canal was part of a US$23 billion dollar deal to sell 45 ports spread over 23 countries to a consortium led by United States investment firm BlackRock. CK Hutchison will pocket US$19 billion.“We have noticed this transaction, and will review it in accordance with the law to ensure fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest,” a spokesman from the anti-monopoly department under the market regulator said in a written reply.The watchdog did not reveal when the investigation would be launched.The department is responsible for conducting antitrust reviews and providing guidance to companies over their response to mitigate risk and ensure compliance overseas.The deal may go through, but Black Rock may not end up with the ports. Though some sources say that talks are still underway between Black Rock and CK Hutchinson, nothing indicates this is anything more than wishcasting. Xi dislikes the deal; the sale has been denounced as a betrayal of China by the state press, and selling the ports to an American company is a blow to Chinese prestige, particularly in the context of Panama being offered a "deal it couldn't refuse" to leave the Belt and Road Initiative. CK Hitchinson is reportedly in talks with the Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world’s biggest container shipping operator that runs dozens of terminals globally. This would remove the point of friction of Chinese ownership without allowing Trump to claim victory.

Lays Down the Law Over Panama Canal, Sets Up Major Confrontation; Panama Folds – RedState and Panama Capitulates - Will Not Renew 2017 Deal With China. What's Next? – RedState. That led to an agreement by CK Hutchinson to sell its Panama facilities to Black Rock. This seemed like an early diplomatic win for President Trump; see China's Out: American Company Taking Control of Panama Canal Ports – RedState.Selling the Canal ports did not prove as popular in Beijing as in Washington. Over the past two weeks, pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao has published a series of commentaries criticising the deal for harming China's national interests and depicting it as a betrayal of China and is a "perfect cooperation" with the U.S. strategy to contain China.China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted some of the commentaries on its website, which fueled speculation Beijing could take steps to try to scupper the sale.China's President Xi Jinping is reportedly angry about the deal. He saw Chinese ownership of the ports as a poke in the eye of American power and a bargaining chip in possible tariff negotiations.Now, Chinese antitrust regulators (yes, I did lol writing that) have been unleashed on the deal, which is much larger than two Panamanian ports.The sale of CK Hutchison’s two ports at each end of the Panama Canal was part of a US$23 billion dollar deal to sell 45 ports spread over 23 countries to a consortium led by United States investment firm BlackRock. CK Hutchison will pocket US$19 billion.“We have noticed this transaction, and will review it in accordance with the law to ensure fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest,” a spokesman from the anti-monopoly department under the market regulator said in a written reply.The watchdog did not reveal when the investigation would be launched.The department is responsible for conducting antitrust reviews and providing guidance to companies over their response to mitigate risk and ensure compliance overseas.The deal may go through, but Black Rock may not end up with the ports. Though some sources say that talks are still underway between Black Rock and CK Hutchinson, nothing indicates this is anything more than wishcasting. Xi dislikes the deal; the sale has been denounced as a betrayal of China by the state press, and selling the ports to an American company is a blow to Chinese prestige, particularly in the context of Panama being offered a "deal it couldn't refuse" to leave the Belt and Road Initiative. CK Hitchinson is reportedly in talks with the Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world’s biggest container shipping operator that runs dozens of terminals globally. This would remove the point of friction of Chinese ownership without allowing Trump to claim victory.

He saw Chinese ownership of the ports as a poke in the eye of American power and a bargaining chip in possible tariff negotiations.Now, Chinese antitrust regulators (yes, I did lol writing that) have been unleashed on the deal, which is much larger than two Panamanian ports.The sale of CK Hutchison’s two ports at each end of the Panama Canal was part of a US$23 billion dollar deal to sell 45 ports spread over 23 countries to a consortium led by United States investment firm BlackRock. CK Hutchison will pocket US$19 billion.“We have noticed this transaction, and will review it in accordance with the law to ensure fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest,” a spokesman from the anti-monopoly department under the market regulator said in a written reply.The watchdog did not reveal when the investigation would be launched.The department is responsible for conducting antitrust reviews and providing guidance to companies over their response to mitigate risk and ensure compliance overseas.The deal may go through, but Black Rock may not end up with the ports. Though some sources say that talks are still underway between Black Rock and CK Hutchinson, nothing indicates this is anything more than wishcasting. Xi dislikes the deal; the sale has been denounced as a betrayal of China by the state press, and selling the ports to an American company is a blow to Chinese prestige, particularly in the context of Panama being offered a "deal it couldn't refuse" to leave the Belt and Road Initiative. CK Hitchinson is reportedly in talks with the Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world’s biggest container shipping operator that runs dozens of terminals globally. This would remove the point of friction of Chinese ownership without allowing Trump to claim victory.

Title: BlackRock’s bold bet lifts Solana sentiment to record levels – Could SOL surge next?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/blackrocks-bold-bet-lifts-solana-sentiment-to-record-levels-could-sol-surge-next/

Full Content:
SOL’s social sentiment is soaring on BlackRock and GameStop news, but price action signals caution. What’s next for Solana? Solana [SOL] has become the center of attention in the crypto market, riding a fresh wave of optimism fueled by institutional interest. With BlackRock launching yield-bearing tokenized treasury funds on the network and GameStop integrating Bitcoin through Solana’s [SOL] infrastructure, sentiment around SOL has surged to unprecedented levels. But will this social momentum translate into a price breakout? Data from Santiment reveals a sharp spike in Solana’s Positive/Negative Sentiment Ratio, climbing to 32.87 – far outpacing sentiment levels around Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Ripple[XRP]. This sharp divergence underscores a unique bullish tilt for SOL on social platforms, suggesting growing investor confidence. Source: Santiment The spike coincides with BlackRock’s strategic use of Solana’s infrastructure and GameStop’s broader crypto pivot, both of which have been heavily amplified by influencers and community support. This fusion of technological utility and mainstream integration has created the perfect storm for a sentiment-driven rally. Despite the sentiment frenzy, Solana’s price action is flashing caution. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $132.49, registering a 4.27% intraday dip. The 50-day Moving Average (MA) at $133.74 has acted as a key resistance level, while the 200-day MA at $183.04 loomed far above, highlighting how much ground SOL needs to reclaim for a true trend reversal. Source: TradingView At press time, the Bollinger Bands were tightening, reflecting contracting volatility. Meanwhile, the Average True Range (ATR) sat at 6.18, suggesting that SOL remains in a low-volatility regime – a potential prelude to an explosive move in either direction. SOL’s price pattern indicates consolidation rather than a breakout despite the overly bullish sentiment among traders. This disparity suggests a potential disconnect between emotional optimism and technical resistance levels. Historically, such euphoria can be risky, especially when unsupported by volume and price action. However, Solana’s robust developer ecosystem and real-world applications in tokenized finance, like BlackRock’s recent initiative, offer solid fundamentals. If SOL surpasses the $140 mark and turns its short-term resistance into support, a rapid upward movement could follow, fueled by persistent social sentiment.

Title: Fidelity says Bitcoin could potentially overtake gold, echoing Saylor’s absorption theory

Fidelity's cautious view contrasts with Saylor's optimism as both eye Bitcoin's trajectory amid growing institutional support. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Fidelity Investments director of global macro Jurrien Timmer believes that Bitcoin (BTC) has a “possible” path to surpassing gold in market value — but “not any time soon.” In a detailed social media post, Timmer explained his view using a chart comparing the projected growth of gold and Bitcoin over time. He noted that if gold continues to grow at its historical compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% — a trend seen since 1970 — and Bitcoin follows either a power law adoption curve or the internet’s S-curve growth model, the two could converge within the next 10 to 20 years. Timmer wrote: “If Bitcoin grows at the rate suggested by these two models, then hard money is likely winning the race, which suggests that gold will be appreciating faster than 8% per year. So, my guess is that gold will always be Bitcoin’s quieter older sibling.” The prediction is much more cautious than forecasts shared by other industry leaders like Galaxy and Strategy founder Michael Saylor. Timmer’s comments come amid significant volatility in crypto markets. Bitcoin fell below $84,000 again on March 28, equating to a roughly 33% decline against gold since its December peak. The price struggles come as inflation concerns and trade tensions continue to weigh on risk assets amid the subdued market sentiment. Meanwhile, gold continues to reach new all-time highs, reinforcing its long-standing role as a safe haven. Despite Bitcoin’s price decline, major institutions continue to show confidence in the asset. On March 27, Fidelity and BlackRock drove a combined $89 million into Bitcoin ETFs, led by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which saw $97.1 million in inflows. The continued capital injection signals growing institutional conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects — even as near-term price action paints a more bearish picture. While Timmer offered a measured take, Strategy founder Michael Saylor recently presented a far more aggressive forecast. Speaking at the DC Blockchain Summit on March 28, Saylor predicted Bitcoin’s market cap could soar to $500 trillion as it absorbs value from traditional assets like gold, real estate, and even sovereign wealth. Saylor argued that Bitcoin is replacing “20th-century assets” with a digital, decentralized, inflation-resistant alternative. He compared the shift to historic changes in monetary systems — like European colonizers introducing coinage to societies that used beads or shells. Saylor added that the US has the “opportunity to grab” 25% to 30% of global Bitcoin value once the “dust settles” from this asset reorganization. Still, the debate is clearly shifting. As more institutional money flows in and long-term models project exponential adoption, the conversation is no longer whether Bitcoin belongs in the same conversation as gold — but when and under what conditions it might catch up. For now, Fidelity’s Timmer urged caution and said the flippening is “possible,” but gold — steady, quiet, and time-tested — still holds the upper hand.

According to Musk, the merger values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in April 2022. By October 2024, Fidelity Investments adjusted the valuation of its stake in X, estimating the company’s overall value to be approximately $9.4 billion. Though its valuation had recovered somewhat by December 2024, it was still down a whopping 77% from Musk’s purchase price. How Musk arrived at a $33 billion valuation, in other words, would make for interesting reading. @xAI has acquired @X in an all-stock transaction. The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt). Since its founding two years ago, xAI has rapidly become one of the leading AI labs in the world, building models and data centers at… — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 28, 2025 Already the head of several companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, Musk launched xAI in July 2023, a year after purchasing Twitter. While he said the goal of xAI was to “understand reality,” an ongoing feud with former business partner OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was also a driving factor. “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution, and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach,” Musk wrote on X Friday. “The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge.” Calling X “the digital town square,” Musk said the platform boasted over 600 million active users. However, Meta, which launched a rival social media platform, Threads, in July 2023, and Bluesky, which launched in February of that year, have been trying to woo away users. Bluesky's user count surpassed 27.44 million users in January 2025, many of whom had left Twitter after Musk’s takeover. At the same time, bolstered by its connections to Facebook and Instagram, Threads had over 320 million monthly active users as of February 2025. Musk made headlines in July of last year when it was revealed that Grok would be trained on X user data. The setting can be disabled, but is on by default for user accounts. Some social media users jeered today’s announcement, mocking the apparently sizable valuation boost in a deal between two of Musk's own companies. “I also sold my 2008 Honda Accord to myself for $1 million,” New York Times tech reporter Ryan Mac said on Bluesky. “Wait a min…what’s different though… other than on paper?” an X user asked. Congratulations to @elonmusk on xAI's acquisition of X.

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Contributing Author | Mar 28, 2025 | Health | 0 comments This article was originally published by Tyler Durden at ZeroHedge. Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong – a transplant surgeon-turned-biotech billionaire renowned for inventing the cancer drug Abraxane – has issued a startling warning in a new in-depth interview with Tucker Carlson. Soon-Shiong, founder of ImmunityBio ($IBRX) and owner of the Los Angeles Times, claims that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the very vaccines developed to fight it, may be contributing to a global surge in “terrifyingly aggressive” cancers. In the nearly two-hour conversation, the Los Angeles Times owner leveraged his decades of clinical and scientific experience to outline why he suspects an unprecedented cancer epidemic is unfolding. This report examines Dr. Soon-Shiong’s background and assertions, the scientific responses for and against his claims, new data on post-COVID health trends, and the far-reaching implications if his alarming hypothesis proves true. Soon-Shiong is a veteran surgeon and immunologist who has spent a career studying the human immune system’s fight against cancer. He pioneered novel immunotherapies and even worked on a T-cell based COVID vaccine booster during the pandemic. In the interview, he draws on this background to voice deep concern over rising cancer cases, especially among younger people – something he describes as a “non-infectious pandemic” of cancer. He tells Carlson that in 50 years of medical practice, it was extraordinarily rare to see cancers like pancreatic tumors in children or young adults, yet recently such cases are appearing. For instance, Soon-Shiong was alarmed by seeing a 13-year-old with metastatic pancreatic cancer, a scenario virtually unheard of in his prior experience. “I never saw pancreatic cancer in children… the greatest surprise to me was a 13-year-old with metastatic pancreatic cancer,” Soon-Shiong told Carlson, adding that he’s seen examples of very young patients (even children under 11 with colon cancer) and unusual surges in aggressive diseases like ovarian cancer in women in their 30s. These personal observations of more frequent, aggressive cancers in youth led him to probe what might have changed in recent years. “We’re clearly seeing an increase in certain types of cancer, like pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer… colon cancer… in younger people.” — Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong According Soon-Shiong, the COVID era is the obvious change – and suggests that both the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and the widespread vaccination campaigns could be key drivers behind this cancer spike. He emphasizes the massive scale of human exposure to the virus and its spike protein (via infection or vaccination). “I don’t know how to say that without saying it. It scares the pants off me because I think what we may be, I don’ think it’s virus versus man now, this is existential. I think when I talk about the largest non-infectious pandemic that we’re afraid of, this is it.” “Billions of people – literally billions – had the COVID virus. Over a billion got the spike protein vaccine,” said Carlson, adding “So that’s like, we’re talking like a huge percentage of the Earth’s population, unless I’m missing something.” “Now you understand what keeps you awake at night and kept me awake at night for two years, two and a half years,” Soon-Shiong replied, suggesting that exposure to both is silently undermining the immune system’s natural defenses against cancer on a global scale. Soon-Shiong frames COVID-era cancers as potentially virally triggered or exacerbated. In the interview, he described cases of “virally induced cancers” in clinics during the pandemic – patients whose cancers may have been kicked into overdrive by the cascade of inflammation and immune stress associated with COVID-19 (Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong: You’re Being Lied to About Cancer, How It’s Caused, and How to Stop It). COVID infection causes a massive inflammatory response, and some cancers are known to exploit inflammation to grow. TUCKER: “a lot people have pointed to both COVID, the virus, and to the mRNA COVID vaccines as potential causes. Do you think that they’re related?“ SOON-SHIONG: “The best way for me to answer that is to look at history. What we know about virally-induced cancers is well-established. We know that if you get hepatitis, you get liver cancer. Hepatitis is a virus infection. We know if you got human papillomavirus, HPV, you get cervical cancer.” We know that certain viruses directly cause cancer (e.g. HPV, Epstein-Barr), so it’s not unprecedented for a virus to play a role in oncogenesis. While SARS-CoV-2 is not a known oncovirus, Soon-Shiong worries its indirect effects – chronic inflammation, immune exhaustion, or “suppressor cells” that emerge in the wake of infection/vaccination – could be accelerating tumor development. “The answer is to stop the inflammation…clear the virus from the body,” he argues, positing that until we eradicate the lingering virus and restore immune balance, we may see mounting cancer cases. * * * Fight inflammation with IQ Biologix (super potent) Ultra Turmeric In sum, Dr. Soon-Shiong’s claim is that the pandemic has set the stage for an explosion of aggressive cancers: the COVID virus itself (especially if it persists in survivors) might suppress immune surveillance, and the mRNA vaccines “that didn’t stop it” might inadvertently contribute to an immunosuppressive environment. These effects, in his theory, could be unleashing cancers that the immune system would ordinarily have kept in check. Watch: A number of clinicians and researchers have reported similar worrying observations, though these remain largely anecdotal at this stage. One prominent voice echoing Soon-Shiong’s concern is Dr. Angus Dalgleish, a veteran oncologist and professor at St. George’s, University of London. In late 2022, Dalgleish wrote to the BMJ’s editor after noticing that some cancer patients who had been stable for years experienced “rapid progression of their disease after a COVID-19 booster.” He cited cases of individuals who were doing well until shortly after vaccination – new leukemias, sudden appearance of Stage IV lymphomas, and explosive metastases in patients who had post-vaccine bouts of feeling unwell. “I am experienced enough to know that these are not coincidental,” Dalgleish wrote, noting that colleagues in Germany, Australia, and the U.S. were independently seeing the same pattern. This frontline testimony aligns with Soon-Shiong’s fear: something about the immune system post-vaccination might be removing restraints on latent cancers. Dalgleish specifically pointed to short-term innate immune suppression after mRNA vaccination (lasting for several weeks) as a plausible mechanism. Many of the cancers he saw were ones normally held in check by immune surveillance (melanomas and B-cell cancers), so a temporary post-vaccine drop in immune vigilance could allow a tumor growth spurt. He also alluded to “suppressor gene suppression by mRNA in laboratory experiments” – a reference to preliminary studies that found the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein might interfere with key DNA repair or tumor-suppressor proteins in cells. These lab findings (while not yet confirmed in living organisms) lend some biological plausibility to the idea that spike exposure could affect cancer-related pathways. Beyond individual doctors, some research is probing links between COVID and cancer behavior. For example, a 2022 study in Frontiers in Oncology explored how SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with cancer cells. It found that the virus’s membrane (M) protein can “induce the mobility, proliferation and in vivo metastasis” of triple-negative breast cancer cells in the lab (Frontiers | SARS-CoV-2 M Protein Facilitates Malignant Transformation of Breast Cancer Cells). In co-culture experiments, breast cancer cells exposed to the viral protein essentially became more aggressive and invasive. The researchers concluded that COVID-19 infection “might promote…aggressive [cancer] phenotypes” and warned that cancer patients who get COVID could face worse outcomes. While this is one specific context (breast cancer cells and one viral protein), it underpins Soon-Shiong’s general concern: the virus can directly alter the tumor microenvironment to the cancer’s advantage. Another line of evidence involves latent viruses and inflammation. Doctors have documented unusual reactivations of viruses like Epstein-Barr (which is linked to lymphomas and other malignancies) during both COVID-19 and post-vaccine immune reactions. Such reactivations hint at a period of immune dysregulation that might also let nascent cancer cells slip past defenses. Or course,fact-checkers and medical authorities argue that there is no credible evidence of vaccines causing meaningful immune suppression. “There isn’t evidence to date that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer or lead to worsening cancer,” one infectious disease expert told FactCheck.org, though they do acknowledge rare side effects like myocarditis or blood clots were found, but not cancer. While the scientific community debates mechanistic links between COVID and cancer, independent analysts have been parsing population-level data for unusual patterns. One notable effort is by Phinance Technologies, a research firm co-founded by former BlackRock portfolio manager Edward Dowd. Phinance has been analyzing excess mortality and disability data since the pandemic, looking for signals of broad health impacts in the aftermath of COVID and mass vaccination. Their findings reveal concerning trends, especially among younger, working-age populations, that lend some weight to Dr. Soon-Shiong’s general warning of a post-COVID health crisis (though not specific to cancer alone). Phinance’s “Vaccine Damage Project” examined the U.S. population aged 16–64 (essentially the workforce) and stratified outcomes into four groups: no effect, mild injuries, severe injuries (disabilities), and death. Using official government databases (the CDC, Bureau of Labor Statistics, etc.), they estimated how each category changed starting in 2021 – when vaccines rolled out and COVID became widespread. The results are sobering. According to Phinance’s analysis, by the end of 2022 the U.S. had experienced approximately 310,000 excess deaths among adults aged 25-64 (a ~23% increase in mortality in that group over normal expectations). Notably, they argue that after mid-2021, with vaccines available and the virus itself becoming less deadly (due to immunity and milder variants), COVID-19 should not have been causing such high excess death rates. Therefore, those 310k “unexplained” deaths in 2021–2022 could represent an upper bound on vaccine-related fatalities or other pandemic collateral damage. Even more striking is the data on new disabilities. Phinance found that from early 2021 through late 2022, about 1.36 million additional Americans (age 16–64) became disabled – a 24.6% rise in disability in that cohort, far above historical trend. This jump in disabilities among the workforce correlates in time with the vaccine rollout (and was disproportionately higher in the labor force than among those not working). The analysts note that the healthiest segment of the population (employed working-age adults) saw a greater relative increase in disabilities after Q1 2021 than the older or non-working groups. This is unusual, since typically health shocks hit the elderly hardest – but here something was impacting younger, healthy people to a significant degree. Phinance investigated further and found a tight relationship between the cumulative number of vaccine doses administered and the rise in disabilities in 2021-22. In fact, for the 16–64 population, they computed a ratio of about 4 new disabilities per excess death in that period, suggesting many survivors were left with lingering health issues even if they didn’t die.

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Wait — Elon Musk just sold X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, to himself? Well, kind of. Musk, in a post on X Friday, said that his artificial-intelligence company, xAI, has acquired X in an all-stock transaction that values X at $33 billion ($45 billion minus $12 billion in debt). The deal gives xAI a valuation of $80 billion, Musk claimed. Musk acquired Twitter in October 2022 for $44 billion and took the company private. What’s going on here? With the sale of X to xAI, Musk is merging the investor base of the social network with that of his AI company (some of which the two companies have in common). Musk had previously said that investors in X Corp. will own 25% of xAI.

March 28, 2025 18:07 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.

Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: CoreWeave Cofounder Discusses Cloud AI Firm’s IPO, Biggest Of 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/phoebeliu/2025/03/28/coreweave-cofounder-cloud-computing-ai-firms-ipo-biggest-mcbee-intrator-venturo/

ByPhoebe Liu ByPhoebe Liu Forbes Staff. CoreWeave cofounders Brian Venturo (chief strategy officer), Michael Intrator (CEO) and Brannin McBee (chief development officer), from left to right. CoreWeave made its public market debut on Friday with the first big IPO of 2025. The company, which rents cloud computing power to customers that need it for AI applications, exploded onto the scene over the last couple of years. On Friday, its stock closed around $40 per share, the same as its pricing and slightly above its opening $39 per share—implying a valuation of $23 billion on a fully diluted basis (accounting for outstanding options and restricted stock). “God, like, what a crazy thing to accomplish. I’ve been shoulder to shoulder with some of the most amazing people on the planet executing for the last seven years,” gushed cofounder and Chief Development Officer Brannin McBee in an interview with Forbes on Friday. “At the same time, it’s the quintessential ‘this is the beginning’ statement. … it’s just another day at CoreWeave.” In one way it was: the cloud computing company, which initially aimed to raise between $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion ended up pricing its shares at $40, well below its target of $47 to $55. As such, the company raised less money ($1.5 billion) and at a lower valuation than they’d aimed for, per documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In fact its valuation of $23 billion is almost exactly what it was when it sold shares in a private transaction in October 2024, according to the company’s initial public offering prospectus filed in early March. It was based on that information that Forbes declared the three founders and one board member all billionaires in early March. CEO Michael Intrator, Chief Strategy Officer Brian Venturo and McBee own 11%, 7% and 5% of CoreWeave’s shares, respectively, while board member Jack Cogen owns 4%. After factoring in the stock they sold while CoreWeave was still a private company, Forbes estimates that Intrator is now worth $2.7 billion, Venturo is worth $1.7 billion, McBee is worth $1.3 billion, and Cogen is worth $1 billion; those net worths are actually down more than 10% apiece than when we first estimated their fortunes, due to the lower pricing. A spokesperson for CoreWeave did not respond to a request for comment on the cofounders’ net worths. “I think we raised exactly what we needed for the business,” McBee says. “Pricing discovery is hard. Pricing discovery is harder in market volatility. But what you’re looking at today is a business with immense value and immense investor interest.” CoreWeave is in many ways a poster child of the exponentially growing appetite for computing power for the AI boom. In 2017, the then-commodity traders Intrator, Venturo and McBee started Atlantic Crypto, using Nvidia chips they’d stockpiled to mine cryptocurrency. Two years later, they renamed it CoreWeave and shifted the business model to building data centers and selling computing power to companies that didn’t have enough of their own GPU servers–storage systems comprised of electronic circuits called graphics processing units. After OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022 and unleashed something of an AI firestorm, CoreWeave’s customers were, increasingly, AI companies. Now, according to the company’s new filing, CoreWeave’s biggest customers are Microsoft, IBM, Meta, NVIDIA and billion-dollar AI labs Cohere and Mistral. Still, investors expressed concerns about CoreWeave’s dependence on these large customers (with $10-billion-plus, multi-year deals with OpenAI and Microsoft; the latter generated more than 60% of CoreWeave’s 2024 revenue), heavy net losses ($860 million on $1.92 billion in revenue in 2024) and debt-reliant financing. The OpenAI deal, a $12 billion contract announced on March 10, complements OpenAI’s “commercial deals with Microsoft and Oracle, and our joint venture with Softbank on Stargate,” CEO Sam Altman wrote in a press release—referring to a $500 billion partnership aiming to secure American AI supremacy. McBee isn’t worried. “It’s a bit of a self-reinforcing mechanism,” he says. “If we’re helping the biggest companies grow, they’re just going to get bigger.” Between glances out the window, he adds that CoreWeave plans to target slightly smaller customers to diversify their customer base. On CoreWeave’s path to profitability, McBee is confident that the company’s contracts will pay off infrastructure costs in less than three years. Also up in the air, of course, is whether demand will continue to grow. It’s expensive to build data centers, and CoreWeave has 32 of them running more than 250,000 GPUs as of the end of 2024—and plans to continue expanding long-term. CoreWeave is certainly betting that it will. In late 2024, for example, CoreWeave signed a 15-year, $4.5 billion agreement with crypto company Galaxy to lease their data center in west Texas. Regardless of where CoreWeave’s share price ends up, the cofounders have nothing to worry about—financially speaking. They have cashed out more than the typical pre-IPO founder does: the three cofounders and Cogen each sold more than $150 million of CoreWeave’s shares (before taxes) as part of private market sales in 2023 and 2024. McBee says the cofounders intend to stay at CoreWeave for the foreseeable future. “We are the long-term management team,” he says. “We have so much to build.”

Rarely if ever have six teams still been in the hunt for play-off places entering the penultimate round of the Energia All-Ireland League Division 1A, but seldom has there been such an unpredictable and competitive top flight. Nowhere are the stakes higher than at Ballymacarn Park where the champions Cork Con go into the last two rounds in third place on 52 points but sit only six points ahead of Ballynahinch in sixth. The home side have Ireland club internationals Conor Rankin, George Pringle, Mark Best and captain Bradley Luney all available, while Conor McKee has been released by Ulster, with Luney moving from 8 to lock. After three successive defeats and a spate of departures, injuries and Leinster absentees, Terenure, in fifth on 48 points and also in must-win mode, host a dangerous Young Munster side at Lakelands Park. After losing outhalf Conor McKeon to a broken leg in last week’s defeat on the Aviva back pitch, Aran Egan shifts to 10 and Adam La Grue to 15, and Terenure do welcome back tow familiar faces in centre Peter Sylvester and winger Caolan Dooley for their first appearances of the season. Sylvester has been living in Miami this season, while Dooley, man of the match when ‘Nure won the final two seasons ago, also went to the US last season and has recovered from a neck injury which required an operation. Lansdowne, the form team in 1A since winning the Bateman Cup in early January, sit fourth on 51 points ahead of their trek to relegation threatened UCD, who are in the relegation play-off spot and trail City of Armagh by two points. Lansdowne are unchanged, while UCD are far from loaded with their Leinster academy players, albeit they do welcome back centre Ben Brownlee, are fighting for their 1A lives and have been something of a bogey side for Lansdowne over the years. Clontarf and St Mary’s, in first and second place on 60 and 58 points, are sitting comparatively pretty. After a highly effective rebuilding job over the last two seasons, a settled and established way of playing which revolves around their power game, Clontarf are guaranteed a semi-final spot, and any kind of win at doomed Garryowen will ensure a home semi-final. True, they are still missing the Soroka brothers, who are with Leinster in South Africa, and Garryowen did end their 14-match losing streak away to City of Armagh last weekend and also welcome back Brian Gleeson. But Connor Fahy is in midfield after his Under-20 Six Nations campaign and it will be a major surprise if Clontarf don’t do enough to earn an advantageous and covetous semi-final at Castle Avenue. In their return to the 1A after a seven-year absence St Mary’s need only a point to ensure their place in the play-offs, and a win against City of Armagh in Templeville Road will also ensure them of a home semi-final. In 1B, Old Wesley and UCC are battling for the last promotion play-off place, while their opponents, Shannon and Highfield, are in a relegation dogfight with Trinity, away to the new champions Old Belvedere.

Title: Tesla, Nvidia lose ground as markets take a tumble on bad economic news

Tesla’s (TSLA-2.08%) status as the “winner” of President Donald Trump’s new auto tariffs didn’t protect it from a tech-led market selloff on Friday, as the stock followed Nvidia (NVDA-1.87%) and the rest of the Magnificent 7 lower after new economic numbers pointed toward the possibility of stagflation. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.7%, the S&P 500 declined 2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial average shed 715.8 points, or 1.7%. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+0.28%) led the Mag 7 lower, plunging 4.9%, Amazon’s (AMZN-1.42%) stock fell 4.3%, Tesla slid 3.5%, and Nvidia eased 1.6%. The personal consumption report for February released Friday showed the core PCE deflator — the Federal Reserve’s favored inflation measure — heating up while real household spending weakened. That creates a situation where the Fed is torn between curtailing price gains and supporting growth. “Today’s report highlights the difficult predicament the Fed is now confronting,” Citigroup (C+0.77%) economists wrote. “Ultimately, we expect Fed officials to dovishly lean toward their full-employment mandate, but that would depend on upcoming data and in particular on ... March spending and inflation.” Trump’s trade war is also weighing on investors. The 25% tariffs on all car, truck, and auto part imports that the president announced Wednesday evening continued to depress automakers’ stocks Friday, with Stellantis (STLA-0.84%) dropping 4.1%, Ford (F+3.38%) down 2%, and General Motors (GM+0.58%) off 1.1%. The ADRs of Toyota (TM-1.24%), Volkswagen (VWAGY-3.00%) and Honda (HMC-0.46%) also declined. Separately, Lululemon’s (LULU-4.05%) stock plunged 14% after the athleisure wear maker’s sales and profit projections missed analyst expectations. The company has scrambled to update its product line to compete with trendier brands, Reuters (TRI+0.98%) reported. Chris Grisanti, chief market strategist at MAI Capital Management, said he was surprised by the relatively benign market reaction to the auto tariffs, which were more hawkish than he’d anticipated. He now expects new duties on April 2 to also be hawkish, possibly followed by another muted reaction from investors. Chairman Jerome Powell and his fellow policymakers will probably wait longer to see the impact of Trump’s tariffs, especially on inflation, before making any decision on cutting rates, Grisanti told Quartz. “The only way I see Trump getting the Fed on his side is if he tanks the economy,” Grisanti said. “We can slice and dice these economic numbers as much as we want, but the Fed is on hold until we get some tariff clarity.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Shares in CoreWeave (CRWV), a cloud computing company backed by Nvidia (NVDA), ended their market debut flat following a $1.5 billion initial public offering that priced below its expected range. Shares of CoreWeave opened at $39 Friday. It ended the day at $40, its IPO price, trading as high as almost $42 and as low as around $37.50. The company's IPO pricing lagged the expected range of $47 to $55 per share. CoreWeave, which makes money by providing its clients with access to data centers, had also cut the deal's size, selling 37.5 million shares, fewer than the 49 million previously anticipated. Data centers are used to develop artificial intelligence models. The company, which relies on Microsoft (MSFT) for a large portion of its sales, also depends on Nvidia chips for its business. The IPO was the largest by a tech firm in the U.S. since the $5.2 billion offering by chip designer Arm Holdings (ARM) in September 2023, according to Dealogic, and the largest in the U.S. since the $1.75 billion listing by LNG exporter Venture Global in January.

Title: Hollywood’s Studio Leasing Problem Is Much Worse Than You Think
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/03/hollywood-la-studios-soundstages-filming-streaming/
Time Published: 2025-03-28T16:40:28Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy You don’t need to study Hollywood’s golden ages or sift through decades of box office numbers to see there are major problems in Tinseltown that have forced an existential crisis on the entertainment capital of the world. Anyone around just a few years ago during the feverish Streaming Wars can see how quickly show business has descended into a dismal scene. Now — more than a year after the end of the historic labor strikes that shut down the filming industry, and long after people forgot about social distancing — half the film and TV production stages in Los Angeles are said to be empty. The Otis College Report on the Creative Economy released March 27 found that, compared to the peak in 2022, the number of shooting days in L.A. County was down 42 percent in 2024. And analysts estimate Southern California’s production levels are a staggering 50 to 70 percent below their peak just six years ago. The declining level of filming activity and rising industry unemployment numbers are more than alarming, particularly as the region wrestles with a high cost of living and economic uncertainties. And all these challenges were evident and insurmountable in many cases even before the region was hit by historically devastating wildfires in January. This is not necessarily from a lack of demand for new content, either. “California is not the first, second, third, fourth or fifth choice for filming at the moment,” said Sam Nicassio, president of Los Angeles Center Studios. The entertainment industry’s distribution and marketing sectors are likely to remain in L.A. over the long term, but stakeholders say Hollywood is in serious danger of losing its claim as the best place to make movies and television. Jason Hariton — chief studio and real estate officer at MBS Group, the operator affiliate of the biggest owner of content creation space in the world, Hackman Capital Partners — said L.A. is not competitive in terms of attracting new high-end film production. “It’s not even on the list in terms of being competitive with those other major markets,” he said. Oh, how quickly we forget. Very recently, companies such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook were racing to spend as much money as they could to build up their content libraries. They edged their way into Hollywood to compete for eyeballs, and for creative real estate, with the likes of Disney, Warner Bros., Fox, Paramount and Sony — who were themselves also racing to establish their own streaming platforms. Netflix, the era’s darling, led the new wave after moving its L.A. base to Hollywood and master-leasing as much studio space as it could while also declaring it didn’t care about other states’ tax incentives. Netflix’s executives made it clear they were betting on California. As leasing rates grew with viewer subscriptions, studios and their new streaming divisions similarly told developers that if they built more soundstages, they would lease them. That led to this story’s apparent climax when an asset management firm by the name of Blackstone (BX) came to Hollywood in 2020 to break into show business. The real estate company bought a 49 percent stake in Hudson Pacific Properties’ 2.2 million-square-foot portfolio of soundstages and Class A office space — all in Hollywood proper — and partnered with the L.A.-based real estate investment trust to expand the portfolio with new soundstage development in Southern California. Netflix is the portfolio’s largest tenant, leasing 700,000 square feet of the office space on Sunset Boulevard. The move from an asset management titan like Blackstone — which was not traditionally involved in show business real estate — unofficially led to the incredible surge of new outside investors showing up at L.A. City Hall with plans to build soundstages to take advantage of the massive content creation budgets coming out of Hollywood. But that was before the historic writers and actors strikes in 2023. Hollywood has survived many challenges — from the world wars and the Red Scare to a global pandemic. It’s even been through past “runaway production” scares in the 1980s and 1990s, when some studios sent crews to Canada to take advantage of its new tax incentives. Coming out of COVID, there was a record amount of production activity in every market because there was so much pent-up demand and streamers coming online. But, this time, it’s different. After the strikes ended, it didn’t open the floodgates in the same way it did after COVID restrictions were lifted. “I think there was hope that, in January 2024 — bam — we’re all gonna be back in business,” said Nicole Mihalka, vice president at CBRE’s Downtown L.A. office. “But we were slower to ramp up, mostly because all the projects that had been previously greenlit, that were put on hold, needed to be reactivated.” Hariton said there is no instant on/off switch this time. “It’s been incredibly challenging in Greater Los Angeles and in California in terms of production activity,” Hariton said. Leading up to the strikes, it became clear that having subscribers alone wasn’t going to cover the billions spent each year on production. In response, companies cut their budgets and headcounts significantly. That made worse the latest wave of projects being pushed elsewhere. The Otis report also found that there are still 25 percent fewer film and TV jobs in the state than in 2022. Only 26 percent of the jobs lost during the strikes have been recovered, “underscoring the lingering impact of an industry in transition.” That transition also includes rising competition from user-generated content. Studios now find themselves competing for viewers, not only among each other, but also with YouTube and other online platforms that showcase content by amateurs filming in backyards or basements. To see that Hollywood didn’t fully recover from the double labor strikes throughout 2024 has struck fear in stakeholders and investors in the future viability of having so much studio space. Even worse, Netflix is considering leaving those same office buildings on Sunset Boulevard that were part of the landmark Blackstone recapitalization. The streaming giant is thinking of relocating from those buildings, which is more crushing considering the same company has been busy opening new stages in New Jersey, Brooklyn, the United Kingdom and other markets outside California. Hudson Pacific, one of the largest studio developers and Netflix’s favorite landlord, suffered similarly during the strikes, and the REIT’s stock price has fallen 92 percent since its record high five years ago. The development firm has also canceled plans for a new studio development outside of London. “Looking ahead, the film, TV and sound sector appears to be settling into a ‘new normal,’ characterized by lower employment and production levels compared to its pre-strike peak,” according to the Otis report. That new normal could be difficult to accept. But, indeed, a recent report from ProdPro, which surveyed crew members, executives and suppliers on the outlook for 2025 and 2026, showed that none of the top five preferred filming locations was in the U.S. Ghost lights L.A. Center Studios’ Nicassio said he tracks utilization at about 300 soundstages in Southern California, and half are empty right now because global film production is much lower than a couple of years ago, while there’s also far, far more available production space than ever before. “There are 85 jurisdictions in the world right now that have film and TV tax credit incentives, and that number grows,” he said, adding that many other markets have more favorable programs than California’s. Hariton is the fourth generation of his family working in the L.A. entertainment industry, and he previously oversaw global production operations for Netflix. Speaking from his office at the Radford Studio Center, he said it was until recently one of the busiest locations in Hollywood. “You could never get a stage at Radford,” he said. “Our occupancy now is higher than the competition, but we’re at the lowest occupancy that we can ever remember.” He said filming and entertainment is at an inflection point because it has become a worldwide business. In the 1980s and 1990s, some productions left Hollywood for newer, secondary markets like Canada to save money. But it would entail bringing an American crew with them. “Now the entire business is global,” Hariton said. “You can shoot the largest of tentpole films in the likes of a London or a Sydney, or Budapest even. And there’s 100 percent local crew. Canada has a very robust and talented crew base, and so do a lot of locations in Eastern Europe and London. “A television series that moved because of the strikes, it’s not like they’re going to come back in the next season [of the show].” In the past few years, massive billion-dollar studio campuses have sprouted in places like Las Vegas, New York and Nashville, offering better tax incentives, as well as a generally lower cost of living for workers. (To take a recent example: A former military base in Monmouth, N.J., is currently preparing itself to be a 289-acre, $903 million Netflix campus. Or, last week, Innovo Property Group opened a ground-up, purpose-built studio with 274,283 square feet of production and support space and 70,351 square feet of office space in Long Island City, managed by MBS Group.) Last summer, FilmLA — a nonprofit that tracks production activity and shoot days in Southern California — found that of all production activity in L.A., only 3 percent of that activity was related to feature films. “The majority of tentpole film productions do not shoot in Los Angeles,” Hariton said. However, a separate Otis report from last summer found that other markets are struggling with occupancy and demand as well, and that no one market is taking the title from L.A. “Right now we’re in a state of contraction,” Mihalka said. “And so there is excess supply in all markets, not just Los Angeles.” Indeed — when California increased its tax incentive program to its current level a decade ago, Georgia and its 30 percent tax incentive was the top new alternative market luring productions away from Hollywood. But, last year, Georgia studio owners (not named Tyler Perry) started reporting spikes in vacancy rates and their own oversaturation. New York City is another market that saw a rush for studio development the past several years, but last summer the city started facing that same problem of getting people on set. The more recent Otis report also found that employment in California’s creative economy contracted by 0.9 percent during the past year, and was 7.1 percent below the pre-pandemic peak. At the same time, the number of jobs across the remainder of the state’s economy grew by 2.3 percent during the same period. “[California’s] entertainment employment is still below its 2022 peak and may not bounce back soon,” the report said. The loss of production jobs then affects other sectors, including post production, visual effects and music. In February, the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation reported that every dollar spent on California’s Film and Television Tax Credit generates $24.40 in economic activity, $16.14 in GDP and $8.60 in wages. “L.A. was the behemoth for all of those components — now, not for any of the components,” Hariton said. “The majority of your high-end TV and film projects are not shooting in L.A., and those have the highest amount of crew.” ‘Incentives chasing incentives’ Last year, 71 percent of projects recently unable to secure tax credits in California opted to film elsewhere, according to the governor’s office. To address the problem and make California more competitive, lawmakers this summer want to boost California’s Film & Television Tax Credit Program allocation to $750 million per year, well over double the current annual cap of $330 million. That would make it the highest of any state with a capped tax incentive program. New York currently has the highest mark in the U.S. with an annual cap of $700 million, while Illinois and Georgia, which have been popular alternatives for productions the past decade, don’t have a cap at all. But it might not be so easy. California’s base production limit is generally set at 20 percent. But film producers quickly point out the state’s effective limit is a 12 to 13 percent tax incentive because California’s limits which parts of a production qualify, while other markets have that allotment set at 30 percent. Lawmakers on March 24 introduced a revised version that boosts the credit to 35 percent, with an additional 5 percent available for projects outside of L.A., and expands the category of productions that qualify. “The program right now, in its current form, [has] a structural problem,” Hariton said. “[It] needs to be amended to actually be competitive and to be able to properly utilize the $750 million. Increasing the program is wonderful, but it would be all for naught if the program itself wasn’t competitive.” Further, some markets like those in the United Kingdom allow tax breaks for a lot more or even all “above the line” budget items — referring to key creative roles in a production such as directors, screenwriters, key cast members and visual effects. Some even cover residuals for actors, which can be a massive expense for a large-scale production with A-list actors. “It’s not about L.A. versus Atlanta,” Hariton said. “It’s actually about L.A. having a seat at the table. … It’s still not going to be as good as the other international, competitive locations.” The revised tax incentive introduced March 24 does not mention above-the-line costs, which Nicassio said would be an important addition. But he’s worried it could be jurisdictions racing to the bottom. “You have to be careful when increasing the tax credit, or it could turn into incentives chasing incentives,” he said. Cut! The expansion of so many secondary markets — coupled with the number of empty stages — make the current pipeline of soundstage development in Los Angeles utterly overwhelming, if not laughably impossible. That pipeline will need to adjust to the slowdown to not oversaturate the market and further weaken the supply-demand balance. “I think all the [companies with soundstage development] plans that can evaluate are re-evaluating the current status,” Hariton said. “Some have already announced that they’re canceling some big projects. “I think it’s a very concerning time from a studio infrastructure development point. Because right now the demand is not great enough to serve the current supply.” Particularly in California, home to perhaps the nation’s most difficult path to securing entitlements, real estate development is lagging years behind the trends (which is partly why Netflix wanted as many master leases as it could get a decade ago because it was far easier and effective than building the soundstages it needed). Hollywood isn’t giving up, however. Mihalka said there were real signs of leasing life in the second half of last year, and data for February showed improvements over the same month last year. She also said more production companies are looking at office space on studio lots, and she expects a ramp-up in activity throughout the industry this year. “[Those office leases] tells me that definitely production-related and entertainment companies, they want to stay here in L.A., particularly in the core TMZ,” she said, referring to the entertainment industry’s geographic core. “First, we’ve got the office and the groups planning the productions as you see the writers rooms requirements start up again. Then you see the production and the stage activity.” The Otis report found that California is still home to 35 percent of the nation’s film, TV and sound employment, and the state remains the national leader of the creative economy. “Los Angeles continues to be the executive and creative hub of the global screen industry, retaining a concentration of high-wage, highly skilled jobs,” the report read. “However, the cost-sensitive nature of some production means that some projects — particularly those that do not require access to California’s state-of-the-art studios and specialized workforce — will continue to be filmed elsewhere.” CBRE’s Mihalka said show business is always going to hinge on California. “Do I think that Hollywood’s moving to Texas? Absolutely not,” she said. “Especially with the activity that I’m seeing today.” There’s also hope because Hollywood isn’t new to the game, and it’s not the only market facing industry-wide issues. L.A. can fall back on its institutional pull for the creative industry, whereas other markets don’t have the history to fall back on. “The infrastructure is still here,” Nicassio said. “The industry still wants to be here. Your writers, your high-end talent — they still want to be in Southern California. So you couple it all together [with the new tax credit plan], and that’s what we’re putting our hopes on.” Similarly, Hariton said a genuine desire to film in California exists inherently. “If the programmatic changes are made to be competitive, along with the increases,” he said, “then we will see a meaningful and quick recovery.” Gregory Cornfield can be reached at gcornfield@commercialobserver.com.

Title: Hollywood’s Studio Leasing Problem Is Much Worse Than You Think

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy You don’t need to study Hollywood’s golden ages or sift through decades of box office numbers to see there are major problems in Tinseltown that have forced an existential crisis on the entertainment capital of the world. Anyone around just a few years ago during the feverish Streaming Wars can see how quickly show business has descended into a dismal scene. Now — more than a year after the end of the historic labor strikes that shut down the filming industry, and long after people forgot about social distancing — half the film and TV production stages in Los Angeles are said to be empty. The Otis College Report on the Creative Economy released March 27 found that, compared to the peak in 2022, the number of shooting days in L.A. County was down 42 percent in 2024. And analysts estimate Southern California’s production levels are a staggering 50 to 70 percent below their peak just six years ago. The declining level of filming activity and rising industry unemployment numbers are more than alarming, particularly as the region wrestles with a high cost of living and economic uncertainties. And all these challenges were evident and insurmountable in many cases even before the region was hit by historically devastating wildfires in January. This is not necessarily from a lack of demand for new content, either. “California is not the first, second, third, fourth or fifth choice for filming at the moment,” said Sam Nicassio, president of Los Angeles Center Studios. The entertainment industry’s distribution and marketing sectors are likely to remain in L.A. over the long term, but stakeholders say Hollywood is in serious danger of losing its claim as the best place to make movies and television. Jason Hariton — chief studio and real estate officer at MBS Group, the operator affiliate of the biggest owner of content creation space in the world, Hackman Capital Partners — said L.A. is not competitive in terms of attracting new high-end film production. “It’s not even on the list in terms of being competitive with those other major markets,” he said. Oh, how quickly we forget. Very recently, companies such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook were racing to spend as much money as they could to build up their content libraries. They edged their way into Hollywood to compete for eyeballs, and for creative real estate, with the likes of Disney, Warner Bros., Fox, Paramount and Sony — who were themselves also racing to establish their own streaming platforms. Netflix, the era’s darling, led the new wave after moving its L.A. base to Hollywood and master-leasing as much studio space as it could while also declaring it didn’t care about other states’ tax incentives. Netflix’s executives made it clear they were betting on California. As leasing rates grew with viewer subscriptions, studios and their new streaming divisions similarly told developers that if they built more soundstages, they would lease them. That led to this story’s apparent climax when an asset management firm by the name of Blackstone (BX) came to Hollywood in 2020 to break into show business. The real estate company bought a 49 percent stake in Hudson Pacific Properties’ 2.2 million-square-foot portfolio of soundstages and Class A office space — all in Hollywood proper — and partnered with the L.A.-based real estate investment trust to expand the portfolio with new soundstage development in Southern California. Netflix is the portfolio’s largest tenant, leasing 700,000 square feet of the office space on Sunset Boulevard. The move from an asset management titan like Blackstone — which was not traditionally involved in show business real estate — unofficially led to the incredible surge of new outside investors showing up at L.A. City Hall with plans to build soundstages to take advantage of the massive content creation budgets coming out of Hollywood. But that was before the historic writers and actors strikes in 2023. Hollywood has survived many challenges — from the world wars and the Red Scare to a global pandemic. It’s even been through past “runaway production” scares in the 1980s and 1990s, when some studios sent crews to Canada to take advantage of its new tax incentives. Coming out of COVID, there was a record amount of production activity in every market because there was so much pent-up demand and streamers coming online. But, this time, it’s different. After the strikes ended, it didn’t open the floodgates in the same way it did after COVID restrictions were lifted. “I think there was hope that, in January 2024 — bam — we’re all gonna be back in business,” said Nicole Mihalka, vice president at CBRE’s Downtown L.A. office. “But we were slower to ramp up, mostly because all the projects that had been previously greenlit, that were put on hold, needed to be reactivated.” Hariton said there is no instant on/off switch this time. “It’s been incredibly challenging in Greater Los Angeles and in California in terms of production activity,” Hariton said. Leading up to the strikes, it became clear that having subscribers alone wasn’t going to cover the billions spent each year on production. In response, companies cut their budgets and headcounts significantly. That made worse the latest wave of projects being pushed elsewhere. The Otis report also found that there are still 25 percent fewer film and TV jobs in the state than in 2022. Only 26 percent of the jobs lost during the strikes have been recovered, “underscoring the lingering impact of an industry in transition.” That transition also includes rising competition from user-generated content. Studios now find themselves competing for viewers, not only among each other, but also with YouTube and other online platforms that showcase content by amateurs filming in backyards or basements. To see that Hollywood didn’t fully recover from the double labor strikes throughout 2024 has struck fear in stakeholders and investors in the future viability of having so much studio space. Even worse, Netflix is considering leaving those same office buildings on Sunset Boulevard that were part of the landmark Blackstone recapitalization. The streaming giant is thinking of relocating from those buildings, which is more crushing considering the same company has been busy opening new stages in New Jersey, Brooklyn, the United Kingdom and other markets outside California. Hudson Pacific, one of the largest studio developers and Netflix’s favorite landlord, suffered similarly during the strikes, and the REIT’s stock price has fallen 92 percent since its record high five years ago. The development firm has also canceled plans for a new studio development outside of London. “Looking ahead, the film, TV and sound sector appears to be settling into a ‘new normal,’ characterized by lower employment and production levels compared to its pre-strike peak,” according to the Otis report. That new normal could be difficult to accept. But, indeed, a recent report from ProdPro, which surveyed crew members, executives and suppliers on the outlook for 2025 and 2026, showed that none of the top five preferred filming locations was in the U.S. Ghost lights L.A. Center Studios’ Nicassio said he tracks utilization at about 300 soundstages in Southern California, and half are empty right now because global film production is much lower than a couple of years ago, while there’s also far, far more available production space than ever before. “There are 85 jurisdictions in the world right now that have film and TV tax credit incentives, and that number grows,” he said, adding that many other markets have more favorable programs than California’s. Hariton is the fourth generation of his family working in the L.A. entertainment industry, and he previously oversaw global production operations for Netflix. Speaking from his office at the Radford Studio Center, he said it was until recently one of the busiest locations in Hollywood. “You could never get a stage at Radford,” he said. “Our occupancy now is higher than the competition, but we’re at the lowest occupancy that we can ever remember.” He said filming and entertainment is at an inflection point because it has become a worldwide business. In the 1980s and 1990s, some productions left Hollywood for newer, secondary markets like Canada to save money. But it would entail bringing an American crew with them. “Now the entire business is global,” Hariton said. “You can shoot the largest of tentpole films in the likes of a London or a Sydney, or Budapest even. And there’s 100 percent local crew. Canada has a very robust and talented crew base, and so do a lot of locations in Eastern Europe and London. “A television series that moved because of the strikes, it’s not like they’re going to come back in the next season [of the show].” In the past few years, massive billion-dollar studio campuses have sprouted in places like Las Vegas, New York and Nashville, offering better tax incentives, as well as a generally lower cost of living for workers. (To take a recent example: A former military base in Monmouth, N.J., is currently preparing itself to be a 289-acre, $903 million Netflix campus. Or, last week, Innovo Property Group opened a ground-up, purpose-built studio with 274,283 square feet of production and support space and 70,351 square feet of office space in Long Island City, managed by MBS Group.) Last summer, FilmLA — a nonprofit that tracks production activity and shoot days in Southern California — found that of all production activity in L.A., only 3 percent of that activity was related to feature films. “The majority of tentpole film productions do not shoot in Los Angeles,” Hariton said. However, a separate Otis report from last summer found that other markets are struggling with occupancy and demand as well, and that no one market is taking the title from L.A. “Right now we’re in a state of contraction,” Mihalka said. “And so there is excess supply in all markets, not just Los Angeles.” Indeed — when California increased its tax incentive program to its current level a decade ago, Georgia and its 30 percent tax incentive was the top new alternative market luring productions away from Hollywood. But, last year, Georgia studio owners (not named Tyler Perry) started reporting spikes in vacancy rates and their own oversaturation. New York City is another market that saw a rush for studio development the past several years, but last summer the city started facing that same problem of getting people on set. The more recent Otis report also found that employment in California’s creative economy contracted by 0.9 percent during the past year, and was 7.1 percent below the pre-pandemic peak. At the same time, the number of jobs across the remainder of the state’s economy grew by 2.3 percent during the same period. “[California’s] entertainment employment is still below its 2022 peak and may not bounce back soon,” the report said. The loss of production jobs then affects other sectors, including post production, visual effects and music. In February, the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation reported that every dollar spent on California’s Film and Television Tax Credit generates $24.40 in economic activity, $16.14 in GDP and $8.60 in wages. “L.A. was the behemoth for all of those components — now, not for any of the components,” Hariton said. “The majority of your high-end TV and film projects are not shooting in L.A., and those have the highest amount of crew.” ‘Incentives chasing incentives’ Last year, 71 percent of projects recently unable to secure tax credits in California opted to film elsewhere, according to the governor’s office. To address the problem and make California more competitive, lawmakers this summer want to boost California’s Film & Television Tax Credit Program allocation to $750 million per year, well over double the current annual cap of $330 million. That would make it the highest of any state with a capped tax incentive program. New York currently has the highest mark in the U.S. with an annual cap of $700 million, while Illinois and Georgia, which have been popular alternatives for productions the past decade, don’t have a cap at all. But it might not be so easy. California’s base production limit is generally set at 20 percent. But film producers quickly point out the state’s effective limit is a 12 to 13 percent tax incentive because California’s limits which parts of a production qualify, while other markets have that allotment set at 30 percent. Lawmakers on March 24 introduced a revised version that boosts the credit to 35 percent, with an additional 5 percent available for projects outside of L.A., and expands the category of productions that qualify. “The program right now, in its current form, [has] a structural problem,” Hariton said. “[It] needs to be amended to actually be competitive and to be able to properly utilize the $750 million. Increasing the program is wonderful, but it would be all for naught if the program itself wasn’t competitive.” Further, some markets like those in the United Kingdom allow tax breaks for a lot more or even all “above the line” budget items — referring to key creative roles in a production such as directors, screenwriters, key cast members and visual effects. Some even cover residuals for actors, which can be a massive expense for a large-scale production with A-list actors. “It’s not about L.A. versus Atlanta,” Hariton said. “It’s actually about L.A. having a seat at the table. … It’s still not going to be as good as the other international, competitive locations.” The revised tax incentive introduced March 24 does not mention above-the-line costs, which Nicassio said would be an important addition. But he’s worried it could be jurisdictions racing to the bottom. “You have to be careful when increasing the tax credit, or it could turn into incentives chasing incentives,” he said. Cut!

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The gaming retailer paid nearly $270,000 last year for Ryan Cohen’s executive security, while the toy company laid off 120 workers at its headquarters. It’s been another week with far more retail news than there is time in the day. Below, we break down some things you may have missed during the week and what we’re still thinking about. From H&M’s Q1 store closures to Michelle Obama and Steph Curry partnering on a sports hydration drink, here’s our closeout for the week. Williams-Sonoma keeps it 500 Home retailer Williams-Sonoma on Monday announced the company’s inclusion in the S&P 500. “Being included in the S&P 500 is a significant milestone that acknowledges the power of our brand portfolio and growth strategies,” CEO Laura Alber said in a statement. “We remain committed to driving innovation, delivering exceptional products and experiences to our customers, and creating long-term value for our stakeholders.” The company’s portfolio includes its namesake brand, Williams Sonoma Home, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, Pottery Barn Teen, West Elm, Rejuvenation, Mark & Graham and GreenRow. Weaker gross margin hurts H&M’s profitability in Q1 H&M on Thursday reported first-quarter net sales increased 3% year over year to 55.3 billion Swedish Krona (about $5.5 billion). The company’s profitability during Q1 was negatively impacted by weaker gross margin that was affected by increased markdowns, customer investments and external factors, according to an earnings announcement. Gross margin was 49.1% compared to 51.5% last year. CEO Daniel Ervér said it continued to “optimise the store portfolio” through store closures, 40 net of which shuttered during the quarter. “Although we have made important progress in our plan and have good cost control, our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward,” Ervér said in a statement. Sally Beauty partners with Uber Eats Sally Beauty entered the Uber Eats platform on Tuesday, making its products available for delivery nationwide. This is Uber Eats first national beauty partnership and, to honor it, customers can get half off purchases $50 or more through March 31. “Being the first beauty retailer to partner with Uber Eats allows us to take convenience to the next level, further expanding our same-day delivery reach nationwide, making our quality products more accessible than ever before,” Natalie Lockhart, group vice president of strategy, customer insights and digital experience at Sally Beauty Holdings, said in a statement. Michelle Obama, Steph Curry partner to launch Plezi Hydration Plezi Nutrition, the company co-founded by former First Lady Michelle Obama, announced this week that it teamed up with NBA star Steph Curry to create a healthier sports hydration drink. "I'm excited to team up with Plezi to launch Plezii Hydration, a game-changing hydration beverage that I believe can make a real difference for anyone looking to perform at their best," Curry said in a statement. "We've created something with smart ingredients and unbeatable flavor, so people can fuel their bodies the right way. No nonsense, no shortcuts — because the next generation deserves better." Plezi said the beverage touts qualities like two-times the electrolytes, half the sugar, seven-times the potassium and less sodium compared to other sports drinks. The beverage comes in three flavors — lemon lime, tropical punch and orange mango twist — and is available in 16.9-ounce bottles for $2.29. The product is available nationwide on Amazon, as well as in California at Walmart, Albertsons, Safeway, Vons and Pavilions locations. “At Plezi, we're always thinking about how we can change the game when it comes to nutrition," Obama said in a statement. “We're excited to provide a delicious, healthier option for everyone who's trying to get active and stay hydrated." 7-Eleven reintroduces an April Fool’s Day sweet treat 7-Eleven’s Mystery Donut for April Fool’s Day is returning for a limited time. The Bismark-style donut features an unknown flavor filling. Customers can take their guess at the Mystery Donut flavor at participating 7-Eleven, Speedway and Stripes locations from Tuesday through April 29. "Every April, we like to add a little mischief to our bakery offerings with the Mystery Donut as an unexpected twist that's all about surprising our customers in the spirit of April Fool's Day," Brandon Brown, senior vice president of Fresh Foods at 7-Eleven, said in a statement. "It may seem like a prank, but it's no joke!” $268,553 That’s how much GameStop paid to provide executive security services for CEO Ryan Cohen for the fiscal year ending on Feb. 1. “We believe these arrangements and costs are reasonable, appropriate, necessary and in the best interests of the company and its stockholders, as they enable Mr. Cohen to carry out his responsibilities,” the company wrote in a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. GameStop doesn’t consider the securities to be a personal benefit or compensation paid to Cohen. 120 That’s how many employees Mattel will lay off at its headquarters, according to a March 17 notice filed in California in accordance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. The permanent layoffs are effective on May 19. Mattel did not immediately respond to Retail Dive’s requests for comment. The company said last year it was targeting $200 million in cost savings by 2026. Retailers face prolonged stretch of downbeat consumer sentiment The Conference Board said this week that its measure of consumer expectations for employment, business conditions and personal finance fell to its lowest point in 12 years and uncomfortably below the threshold that can signal a recession. Its measure of consumers’ confidence in the economy fell for the fourth straight month. This tracks with other research, including last week’s University of Michigan’s monthly consumer survey, which one economist called “a horrific report.” Much of the anxiety is fueled by the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which announced auto levies earlier this week. “If there was a silver lining in [The Conference Board’s] March report, it was that consumer perceptions of the labor market held steady relative to February,” Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Jeremiah Koh said in a research note this week. “Even so, an overall theme of uncertainty is broadly setting in for the consumer, and the short term policy outlook does not portend an end to this uncertainty with new tariffs on the horizon in April.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Each year brings unique headwinds and tailwinds.

Title: A quality improvement initiative to increase HIV post-exposure prophylaxis treatment for emergency department patients after sexual assault: A pre-post study
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0320690

Many emergency department (ED) patients after a sexual assault face barriers to receiving HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). We implemented a quality improvement initiative which updated the sexual assault electronic health record (EHR) template and made available free, full-course PEP treatment packs for use at provider discretion. The aim of this study was to compare the receipt of HIV PEP for ED patients receiving sexual assault care before and after the initiative. This was a retrospective, quasi-experimental, pre-post study of all ED patients who completed a sexual assault examination between June 1, 2022 – January 31, 2023 (pre-intervention) and March 1, 2023 – October 31, 2023 (post-intervention). An odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to determine the initiative’s effect on PEP prescribing. Multivariable logistic regression models estimated the independent effect of the initiative while controlling for potential confounders. Of the 235 sexual assault examinations, 117 (49.8%) were during the pre-intervention and 118 (50.2%) were during the post-intervention periods. Pre-intervention, the mean age was 33.0 years (standard deviation [SD] 12.3), 94.0% were female, 30.8% Black, 31.6% Latinx, and 28.2% White. Post-intervention, the mean age was 29.2 years (SD 12.6), 90.7% were female, 42.4% Black, 28.8% Latinx, and 17.8% White. Patients were more likely to receive HIV PEP post-intervention (33/118, 28.0%) than pre-intervention (11/117, 9.4%) (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.8 to 7.8). The independent effect of the initiative on HIV PEP prescribing remained significant after controlling for demographics (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 8.0), assault characteristics (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.6 to 11.1), and provider experience (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.7 to 7.5). The availability of HIV PEP treatment packs plus a modification to the EHR template led to a significant increase in the provision of HIV PEP for ED patients after sexual assault.

This work was prepared by the authors in a personal capacity and the opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of their affiliated institutions, employers, or funding agencies. This conflict does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. United States (US) emergency departments (ED) provide care to tens of thousands of patients after sexual assault each year [1–3]. This care includes providing trauma-informed medical and forensic examinations, screening for sexually transmitted infections (STI), and initiating post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for STIs, including the initiation of HIV PEP [4–6]. HIV PEP, the use of antiretroviral medications after a single high-risk event (such as may occur with sexual assault), is highly effective in preventing HIV seroconversion if taken as soon as possible after the exposure (within 72 hours) and with strict adherence to a 28-day regimen [7]. The risk of HIV transmission after sexual assault is not known but felt to be low, with the per-act risk of HIV seroconversion extrapolated from consensual vaginal (0.08%) and receptive rectal intercourse (1.38%) [7,8]. Because of this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend HIV PEP to be considered on a case-by-case basis and after an assessment of assault-related factors that might increase the risk of HIV exposure and transmission. These factors include the likelihood that the assailant has HIV (is a man who has sex with other men or uses injection drugs) or exposure characteristics (did rectal or vaginal penetration occur or were mucosal injuries sustained) [7,9–11]. For many patients in whom HIV PEP is indicated after a sexual assault, receiving PEP in a timely manner and accessing a full treatment course remains a significant barrier [12]. A national survey of nearly 600 US EDs showed that only 65.3% of EDs offered HIV testing and HIV PEP to patients receiving care after a sexual assault [13]. Even when EDs routinely provide HIV testing and HIV PEP after sexual assault, initial compliance with PEP depends on the ability of a patient to first obtain the prescription, which can be impeded by limited access to pharmacies and cost. And for patients who just survived sexual assault, making a separate trip to an outpatient pharmacy may be emotionally triggering and further hinder the ability to obtain medications [12]. To circumvent these barriers, the standard practice for ED HIV PEP delivery in the US is to provide a first dose of an FDA-approved regimen while the patient is still in the ED followed by a prescription for the remaining 27 days [14]. To facilitate short term compliance, some EDs will provide patients with a 3-5 day bridging starter pack in conjunction with a standard prescription [15–17]. Providing the entire 28-day PEP medication supply at the initial visit is another strategy to increase the likelihood of adherence, especially when patients face difficulties returning for follow-up visits [18]. A recent study by Cherabie et al demonstrated an innovative model where 87% of patients at risk for HIV acquisition after sexual assault were provided a full 28-day, meds-in-hand, supply of HIV PEP [19]. In February of 2023, at the Alameda Health System (AHS), Highland Hospital ED, we implemented a quality improvement initiative, “sexual assault PEP” (SA PEP), to increase the receipt of HIV PEP for sexual assault patients. The initiative included two interventions: 1) a modification to the sexual assault electronic health record (EHR) template to include a field prompting examiners to discuss PEP and 2) making available free 28-day supplies of meds-in-hand HIV PEP therapy (PEP treatment packs) for use at the discretion of the sexual assault examiners. The purpose of this study was to compare the receipt of HIV PEP for ED patients receiving sexual assault care in the period before (pre-intervention) and after the SA PEP initiative (post-intervention). This was a retrospective, quasi-experimental pre-post study of a quality improvement initiative. We included all ED patients who completed a sexual assault examination between June 1, 2022 – January 31, 2023 (pre-intervention period) and March 1, 2023 – October 31, 2023 (post-intervention period). We chose this time period based on a consensus agreement among authors that 8 months was a reasonable duration of time to observe both an effect and sustainability of the intervention. The initiative was rolled out in February 2023, which served as a one-month washout period. Patients receiving a sexual assault examination during February 2023 were therefore excluded. We also excluded patients for whom PEP was not indicated (either because they were living with HIV infection or presented ≥72 hours after the assault) or who were transferred from an outside facility and received a first dose of PEP as well as a 28-day prescription by the transferring hospital. The AHS Institutional Review Board approved the study with a waiver of written informed consent. This study was performed in the ED at Highland Hospital in Oakland, California, a level-1 trauma center with an annual census of 57,000 visits. The ED supports a well-established routine HIV screening program and provides rapid antiretroviral therapy (ART) using Biktarvy® (bictegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide) starter packs (donated by Gilead, Sciences) to eligible patients [20]. The Highland Hospital ED serves as the county referral center for sexual assault forensic examinations. At the Highland Hospital ED, sexual assault forensic examinations are conducted by the department’s pool of 20 advanced practice providers (APP) who have specialized training in conducting forensic examinations, with support from a sexual assault patient advocate. Forensic assault examinations are performed within 5 days of the assault, after approval by the responsible law enforcement agency, and with the consent of the patient. The Highland ED performs approximately 180 sexual assault examinations each year, accounting for 75% of the sexual assault examinations in Alameda County for patients ≥ 14 years of age. Using a structured template, a written log with basic patient information and characteristics of the assault is completed by the APP and maintained in a locked cabinet in the sexual assault examiners’ office. Prior to the SA PEP initiative, the protocol for ED HIV PEP was Truvada® (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) plus Tivicay® (dolutegravir) or Isentress® (raltegravir) for eligible patients presenting within 72 hours after sexual assault [21]. Eligibility for HIV PEP was based on the clinical judgment of the treating APP and was not strictly mandated. By protocol, patients were given the first doses of HIV PEP (available in the ED pyxis) as soon as possible during the index visit and then prescribed a complete course of treatment upon discharge (28 days total). Additionally, APPs could use an EHR “sexual assault” template to facilitate accurate and comprehensive documentation of encounters for sexual assault. In January of 2023, an internal review of pharmacy records identified low numbers of ED HIV PEP prescriptions and potential missed opportunities for PEP among patients evaluated after sexual assault. This prompted a meeting between the ED Director of HIV Screening (DAEW) and the APPs to discuss barriers to prescribing PEP. Citing concerns that prescriptions often go unfilled because of pharmacy copays, lack of insurance coverage, and patient difficulties accessing outpatient pharmacies for PEP, the APPs requested approval to use the Biktarvy® starter packs for HIV PEP after sexual assault. They also requested improving the sexual assault EHR template to include a field “reminding” them to assess HIV PEP eligibility. The decision to expand the indications of Biktarvy® to PEP for sexual assault patients was approved from the Division Chief of HIV Medicine, the HIV clinical pharmacy lead, and backed by recommendations of the East Bay Getting to Zero collaborative that included Biktarvy® as one of three preferred HIV PEP regimens [22]. A modification to the sexual assault template included the addition of embedded fields reminding providers to 1) discuss the risks and benefits of PEP and 2) document whether PEP was given. On February 15, 2023, the APPs were notified at a departmental staff meeting and by email that Biktarvy® starter packs could be used for HIV PEP for sexual assault patients at their discretion. APPs were instructed to obtain baseline laboratory testing to ensure the safe use of Biktarvy®, which included having liver function tests < 5 times the upper limit of normal, an estimated glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL/min, and a negative pregnancy test. APPs were instructed to provide eligible patients with 4 starter packs, equaling a 28-day course of PEP (each starter pack consisted of a labeled, sealed bottle containing 7 tablets). This was referred to as an HIV PEP treatment pack. If desired, standard PEP prescriptions using any FDA-recommended regimen could be provided instead of the Biktarvy® treatment packs. Eligibility for HIV PEP remained unchanged, based on the clinical judgment of the treating APP, and was not strictly mandated. The primary outcome measure was the number and proportion of patients undergoing sexual assault examinations who were provided PEP in the pre-intervention compared with the post-intervention period. The sexual assault database was used by trained research staff to identify all sexual assault forensic examinations completed between June 1, 2022, through October 31, 2023. Using a structured data collection instrument, patient level data for each forensic examination were abstracted from a review of the EHR (Epic Systems). The instrument had both closed response and free text fields. Data included patient demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity), discharge time, treating APP, assault characteristics (type of penetration, condom use), whether PEP was offered and provided, and details of any PEP prescription or treatment pack given, including medication type and duration. Data was accessed for research purposes on 11/9/2023, 11/20/2023, 11/29/2023, 3/21/2024, and 3/22/2024. The authors had access to information that could identify individual participants during and after data collection. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the AHS [23,24]. REDCap is a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases. Receipt of PEP was defined as EHR documentation that an HIV PEP prescription was electronically signed by the treating provider or an HIV PEP treatment pack was given. Patients that received only a first dose of HIV PEP while in the ED, but no additional prescription or treatment pack, were not considered as being provided HIV PEP. Incorrect PEP treatment (PEP prescribing errors) was defined as either an incorrect PEP regimen (inadequate treatment, such as Truvada® only) or an incorrect duration of treatment (total duration fewer than 28 days). Correct PEP treatment was defined as a 28-day prescription of an approved HIV PEP regimen. Risk of HIV acquisition from the sexual assault was defined as high (condomless receptive rectal or vaginal sex), moderate (condomless insertive rectal or vaginal sex), and low (insertive or receptive oral sex, exposure to blood, saliva, urine, sex with a condom) according to Pacific AIDS Education and Training Center Criteria [22]. APPs were categorized as high, moderate, or low volume examiners based on the number of sexual assault examinations performed during the study period. Categories were determined posteriori and based on tertiles of completed sexual assault examinations. Descriptive statistics were computed for all variables. Continuous variables were reported as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) and means with standard deviations (SD) and categorical variables as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CI), where appropriate. An odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were calculated to determine the effect of the SA PEP initiative on PEP prescribing for sexual assault patients. Posteriori, three multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the independent effect of the SA PEP initiative while controlling for potential confounders. Model 1 controlled for patient characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), model 2 controlled for assault characteristics (assailant known, risk of HIV risk exposure, discharge time), and model 3 controlled for number of sexual assault examinations performed by APPs. Statistical analyses were performed on de-identified data with Stata (version 14; StataCorp). Between June 1, 2022, and October 31, 2023, 279 patients aged ≥ 14 years underwent 288 sexual assault examinations. Of these, 53 encounters were excluded from the analysis because they occurred during the month of February 2023 (N = 23), were patients living with HIV (N = 7), received PEP at a different facility prior to transfer (N = 8), or presented ≥ 72 hours after the assault (N = 15), leaving 235 sexual assault encounters in the study population. Of the 235 sexual assault examinations, 117 (49.8%) were during the pre-intervention period and 118 (50.2%) were during the post-intervention period (Fig 1). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.g001 Overall, the mean patient age was 31.1 years (SD + /-12.5 years); 217 (92.3%) were female; 86 (36.6%) were Black, 54 (23.0%) were White, and 71 (30.2%) were Latinx. One hundred nineteen (50.6%) assaults were by a known assailant and 127 (54.0%) were documented as being at a high risk for HIV exposure. One hundred and eleven (61.3%) of the sexual assault examinations were completed by high-volume APP examiners (≥15 examinations). Only 31.1% of sexual assault patients were discharged during daytime hours (7am-3pm). Although patients in the pre-intervention period were slightly older than those in the post-intervention period(mean age 33.0 years, SD + /-12.3 years vs. mean age 29.2 years, SD + /- 2.6 years, P = 0.02), there did not appear to be any clinically meaningful differences in characteristics between the study periods (Table 1). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.t001 Use of the sexual assault template was similar between the study periods (pre-intervention: 98/117, 83.8%; post-intervention: 101/118, 85.6%, P = 0.70). Documentation of offering HIV PEP was infrequently recorded in the pre-intervention period (14/117, 12.0%) compared to the post-intervention period(91/118, 77.1%) (P < 0.0001). During the pre-intervention period, 11 of the 117 patients completing sexual assault examinations (9.4%) were provided PEP compared to 33 of the 118 patients (28.0%) during the post-intervention period (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.8 to 7.8) (Table 2). Of the 33 patients receiving PEP during the post-intervention period, 22 (66.7%) received treatment packs and 11 (33.3%) received a prescription. Prescribing errors occurred with 3 (13.6%) of the 22 PEP prescriptions (incorrect PEP regimen N = 1, incorrect treatment duration N = 2) and with none of the 22 PEP treatment packs. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.t002 The results of the three models of multivariable logistic regression are shown in Tables 3–5. After controlling for demographics (model 1: age, gender, and race/ethnicity) (Table 3), assault characteristics (model 2: assailant known status, HIV risk, and time of ED discharge) (Table 4), and APP experience (model 3: high, moderate, low volume examiner) (Table 5), the independent effect of the SA PEP initiative on PEP prescribing remained significant (model 1: OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 8.0; model 2: OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.6 to 11.1; model 3: OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.7 to 7.5). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.t003 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.t004 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.t005 EDs play an essential role in the evaluation and care of patients after sexual assault, including providing HIV PEP when assault-related factors are felt to put the patient at increased risk for HIV exposure and transmission [19]. Receiving PEP in a timely manner and accessing a full treatment course are critical for PEP to be effective in preventing HIV transmission after sexual assault and policies to minimize barriers to receiving a full 28-day course of PEP treatment should be prioritized [5–7,12]. This study evaluates the SA PEP program, a quality improvement initiative designed to increase the receipt of HIV PEP for ED patients after sexual assault through two strategies: 1) a modification to the sexual assault EHR template reminding providers to consider and offer PEP and 2) making available free, 28-day HIV PEP treatment packs. Combined, these strategies increased the receipt of HIV PEP three-fold, from 9.4% to 28.0%, for ED patients after sexual assault. Although the increase in PEP prescriptions during the post-intervention period cannot be attributed with 100% certainty to the SA PEP initiative alone, the differences remained statistically significant across our three logistic regression models which controlled for patient demographics, characteristics specific to the assault, and the experience of the sexual assault examiners. Although unmeasured variables may have influenced the provision of PEP in our study, we are not aware of significant changes in APP staffing, APP training, or ED census that occurred between the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods. Despite minimizing barriers to accessing PEP treatment with the SA PEP initiative, the proportion of patients receiving HIV PEP after sexual assault was relatively low (28%), especially when compared to other published reports of ED HIV PEP after sexual assault [15,16,19,25,26]. A large academic ED in the Northeastern US participating in a sexual assault nurse examiner program reported 124 (69%) of 179 patients receiving sexual assault examinations received HIV PEP over a 3-year period [15]. And a study conducted at the Boston Medical Center ED reported that 82 (45%) of 181 patients evaluated after sexual assault received HIV PEP in the form of a 3-day starter pack [16]. Another study in a large Midwestern ED reported that over a 13-year period, 87% of 423 patients evaluated after a sexual assault where a high-risk HIV exposure was identified received a full course of HIV PEP prior to discharge [19]. The magnitude of differences in HIV PEP treatment rates between these studies and ours may be explained, in part, by specific study exclusion criteria. In our analysis, we included patients regardless of the risk for HIV transmission (post-intervention period excluded only 15 of 133 encounters) whereas in the study by Cherabie et al, over 50% of their initial study population of 908 patients with a visit for sexual assault/abuse were excluded, including patients for whom PEP was not offered [19]. We believe the main driver of our low overall PEP numbers may be due to a low acceptance rather than a lack of offering. During the post-intervention period, EHR documentation revealed that the majority of patients (77%) were offered HIV PEP but only 28% accepted PEP, lower than other ED studies which report higher proportions of HIV PEP acceptance after sexual assault, ranging from 32% to 87% [15,16,19,25,26]. The retrospective nature of the study and available data, however, do not allow for an accurate understanding of why PEP acceptance was so low. A better understanding of the true offer and acceptance rate and reasons behind a patient’s decision to accept or decline PEP requires prospective evaluation. Importantly, we have seen an upward trend in PEP provision and the use of treatment packs with ongoing implementation of our SA PEP initiative, suggesting that the sustainability of this initiative is robust. An analysis of more recent 3 months (February 2024 to April 2024) demonstrate that PEP was provided to 50% of patients completing sexual assault examinations (26/51), with the majority (85%) being treatment packs. Sharing the outcomes from this initiative and eliciting feedback from the APPs at our site will hopefully identify foci for improvement and inform future trainings, educational sessions, and protocols designed to streamline eligibility assessments and increase the acceptance rate of PEP. We believe that providing HIV PEP medications-in-hand for ED patients after a sexual assault examination is the best strategy to ensure timely and appropriate treatment. Same day treatment for ED patients has been shown to improve compliance and decrease return visits and hospitalizations, especially for those who are underinsured or who are discharged at times when pharmacies are closed [27,28]. Prior studies have demonstrated that providing PEP medications-in-hand for ED patients is feasible and increases the receipt of PEP compared to providing standard prescriptions [29,30]. Compliance with PEP, although not assessed in our study, is further improved when single dose versus multiple dose regimens are used [31,32]. Additionally, we recommend supplying the full 28-day treatment at the time of discharge rather than a short bridging course to an outpatient prescription. Full treatment packs are associated with higher acceptance and completion rates than other PEP treatment strategies and assure that the correct medication regimen and duration are provided [33]. Incorrect PEP prescriptions by emergency physicians are not uncommon [34]. In our study, prescribing errors occurred in 3 (13.6%) of the 22 PEP prescriptions written by physicians and in none of the PEP treatment packs. How EDs should best go about providing HIV PEP medications to patients after sexual assault, however, is complicated, and policies guiding implementation will need to be developed at the institutional level, with input from multiple departments, balancing cost, pharmacy considerations, compliance, and safety. Providing medications-in-hand, pre-discharge is not standard ED practice. Routinely providing either starter packs or the entire 28-day course requires that EDs stock PEP drugs or have an established agreement with a pharmacy to stock, package, and rapidly dispense PEP drugs. At our institution, we leveraged an existing hospital Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee exemption which allowed the use of industry-provided Biktarvy® starter packs for use in the ED, expanding the indications to include HIV PEP. The use of industry-provided starter packs, donated free-of-charge, is often prohibited due to institutional policies and regulatory barriers, which may limit replication of our model. The use of ED or hospital-based pharmacies, however, can be used to ensure timely access to HIV PEP therapy for ED patients [30,35]. EDs with discharge pharmacies have been shown to reduce barriers like cost, transportation, and pharmacy access when compared to prescriptions requiring filling at local, outpatient pharmacies [35]. Further, many EDs have access to 24-hour inpatient pharmacies and protocols have been developed whereby these pharmacies store, package, and urgently dispense HIV PEP medications to patients prior to discharge [30]. An additional benefit of utilizing existing pharmacy infrastructure is that patients without insurance or with high copayments can be identified immediately and be enrolled in a patient-assistance program or a no-charge compassionate care provision can be applied [7,36]. This was a retrospective evaluation of a single center and the magnitude of influence of our intervention may not be generalizable to other EDs, particularly those with different patient populations, standardized PEP guidelines for sexual assault patients, and improved access to PEP medication dispensing, such as an in-house, 24-hour, 7-days-per-week pharmacy. The pre-post study design also makes it impossible to attribute the increased provision of PEP solely to the intervention (PEP treatment packs and updated sexual assault template), as other unmeasured factors, such as patient characteristics, examiner practice patterns, or other external events, may influence the primary outcome [37]. Additionally, the relative contribution of the EHR template modification versus the availability of PEP treatment packs with regards to driving the primary outcome measure of PEP prescribing is not known, as these were considered a bundled intervention. Both interventions likely influenced PEP prescribing. Missing data was not uncommon for several of the clinical variables abstracted from chart review (estimation of risk of HIV acquisition missing 32.8% and knowledge of assailant missing 18.5% of the time) and which were included in logistic regression, possibly reducing the model’s ability to accurately predict dependent variables. Patient centered outcomes, such as adherence with PEP, follow-up for repeat HIV testing and surveillance for HIV seroconversion, and opportunities to transition patients with ongoing risk for acquiring HIV infection to pre-exposure prophylaxis, were not assessed. Multiple studies have shown that both adherence with HIV PEP and outpatient follow up after ED initiation are extremely low [15,18,19,38,39]. Prospective studies evaluating barriers to adherence and follow-up are needed. EDs play an important role in the evaluation and care for patients after sexual assault. A clinical intervention consisting of an EHR template modification plus HIV PEP treatment packs led to a significant increase in the provision of PEP for ED patients evaluated after sexual assault and eliminated errors in treatment. Future research should evaluate medication receipt, adherence, and cost effectiveness of PEP treatment packs compared to prescriptions.

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor Good afternoon Insiders, Max Goldbart here taking you through another super busy week of news. Sign up here. ‘No Other Land‘ American Film Academy criticism: On Monday, Israeli filmmaker Yuval Abraham wrote in an X post that his Palestinian No Other Land co-director, Hamdan Ballal, had been attacked by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and was later detained by Israeli soldiers. The story has since moved fast. Abraham posted the next day that Ballal had been freed but was badly beaten while in custody. The 24-hour incident then sparked outcry in the film community, with strong statements from institutions including the European Film Academy. Filmmakers and actors such as Christine Vachon, Ezra Edelman, and Mark Ruffalo lent their names to public calls for Ballal’s release. The incident occurred less than a month after No Other Land won the Best Documentary Oscar, a grim fact that Abraham highlighted as he criticized the American Film Academy for “declining to publicly support” Ballal. The Academy did later send a letter to its members alluding to the incident, which Abraham posted on X and criticized for not mentioning Ballal. The American Academy rarely makes public statements about detentions or instances of violence against Academy winners, but in 2011, it did call for the release of multiple detained Iranian filmmakers, we have noted. The Israel Defense Forces and Israeli Police have denied being involved in any beating. Israeli authorities have said that Ballal was detained along with several others on suspicion of throwing stones, damaging property, and compromising the security of the area. The incident is devastating and comes as global stakeholders once again try to bring about ceasefire for a conflict that has lasted nearly 18 months. Related Stories Documentary 'No Other Land' Directors Thank Academy Members For Coming To Defense Of Hamdan Ballal After Attack News Academy Apologizes For Not Naming 'No Other Land' Or Its Co-Director In Statement Denouncing Attacks On Artists Series Mania Wraps Up Cautious optimism and star power: Another year down for European TV’s biggest get-together and Series Mania is now certainly very much established as such. Myself, Jesse and Stewart have spent the week in Lille taking the temperature of the global TV biz and seeing what people have to say. The vibe on the ground was cautious optimism, as creatives and producers embrace challenges with spirit. Check out our five takeaways dive deep into what people were discussing. The funding crisis in drama was front and center, although we found that this is very much not a “one size fits all” problem and some are experiencing it more acutely than others. Stewart also had a think about the future of the fest as it hits a crossroads – it has become so big now (we hear attendance this year was up 20%) that it feels as though it could comfortably swallow up the now-defunct Cannes-based MIPTV and beyond. At the same time, star power at Series Mania only rises, with the likes of Amanda Seyfried, Christina Hendricks and Pamela Adlon all out and about and seemingly having a whale of a time in northern France. What could be next for this buzzy festival? We’ll be keeping a close eye. All our coverage from the week can be found here. BAFTA Turns To Small Screen Reindeers & Horses: While the BBC will no doubt point to a 75-nom haul as evidence the corporation remains at the peak of its power, yesterday’s BAFTA TV Awards anno shone a light on a trio of the biggest British streaming hits. Baby Reindeer topped the charts with eight, followed closely by Apple TV+’s Slow Horses and Disney+’s Rivals, with big names like Gary Oldman, Jonathan Pryce (for the first time) and Richard Gadd being recognized from these shows. The noms come at a time when funding local British drama is getting harder and harder, and it was therefore satisfying to see ITV’s Mr Bates vs the Post Office neck-and-neck with these splashy streamer hits. Speaking to us afterwards, BAFTA boss Jane Millichip warned of “choppy waters” if the drama affordability issues aren’t resolved. She also pointed out that the tonal barriers are breaking down between shows commissioned by the broadcasters and the streamers. This time next year, two Netflix breakouts that are currently tearing up the global charts yet feel very much like they could have found a home at a British broadcaster, Adolescence and Toxic Town, might be in with a shout for BAFTAs, Millichip suggested. Elsewhere, there were high-profile snubs in the form of The Day of the Jackal, Wolf Hall’s Mark Rylance and Prime Video receiving just one nomination, while there were happy surprises like the always popular Billie Piper being recognized for Netflix’s Scoop. Jake’s “snubs and surprises” deep dive can be viewed here. The awards take place May 11. Jennifer Salke Out Bond seals Jen’s fate: The first top exec change at a global streamer since 2020 happened overnight. Jennifer Salke is out over at Amazon MGM, although she will segue to a producer first-look deal at the same company. As there are already separate TV and film bosses at Amazon MGM, Salke will not be replaced, with Courtenay Valenti (film) and Vernon Sanders (TV) now reporting directly to Mike Hopkins. More restructuring is expected to follow and we are already hearing this could impact international, where Amazon has recently made layoffs and shuffled its pack. Salke’s legacy is mixed. Big hits including The Boys, Fallout and Mr. & Mrs. Smith have come during her tenure, but they have been relatively few and far between and have run concurrent with scrutiny over expensive projects like The Rings of Power and the Russos’ Citadel. Furthermore, Mike Fleming Junior writes that Salke’s “inability to mesh with the gatekeepers of the James Bond movies” might well have sealed her fate. “While her exit from the executive suites officially is being regarded as an exit by choice into a producing deal, sources in town say it is closer to a firing,” he writes. Ears to the ground over what comes next for Amazon. ‘Holy Cow’! A cheesy win: I wanted to drop what I was doing and do my best to stream Holy Cow immediately upon reading Melanie’s fab Global Breakout piece this week. Mel took us to France, where Holy Cow, the feature directorial debut of Louise Courvoisier, has drawn close to 1 million spectators locally. The movie follows a teenager raised in a farming community in the Eastern department of Jura who embarks on a mission to make a prize-winning wheel of Comté cheese in the face of a series of hard knocks. Sounds brie-liant to me. Mel writes that while Holy Cow may not seem like a crowd-pleaser or box office breakout on paper, it has managed to gross roughly $6.5M from a $2.1M (€2M) budget. The pic also won best first film at the French César awards. Check out the Breakout over here.

Title: Forbes Daily: U.S. Tourism Is Taking A Hit From Trump’s Policies

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob Forbes Staff andForbes Daily Forbes Staff. Last year was a banner year for companies in the S&P 500. But for small businesses, the picture is more complicated. For the first time in three years, more small businesses reported a drop in revenue in 2024 than an increase, a new Fed survey shows. Meanwhile, around 75% of firms in the S&P reported year-over-year revenue growth for fiscal year 2024, according to data from FactSet. Still, the picture isn’t entirely gloomy. Fewer small businesses said costs were going up, meaning customers may not be spending less—the companies just may not be pushing through as many price increases that inflate revenue. ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; PHOTO BY NATHAN DUMLAO/UNSPLASH After Donald Trump won the election in November, conditions seemed ripe for a boom in mergers and acquisitions after several years of declines. But that hasn’t happened yet, primarily due to Trump’s tariffs and other moves that have sparked fears of a slowdown. The Trump Administration’s policies—from tariffs to the high-profile detentions of foreigners with legal tourist visas and green cards—are having a negative impact on tourism to the U.S., a growing body of data shows. Tourism Economics, a nonpartisan Oxford Economics company, is forecasting total U.S. travel spending will be 3.7% lower than its original prediction from December, amounting to an estimated $64 billion loss this year for the U.S. economy. The New York Stock Exchange’s parent company signed a memorandum of understanding with Circle, issuer of the world’s second-largest stablecoin, to explore integrating Circle’s products into its trading and clearing empire. Stablecoins are having a moment amid a legislative push from the Trump Administration, which sees the tokens as a key way to maintain the U.S. dollar’s global dominance. Gather Health cofounder and CEO Brent Asplin with patient Karen Sterling. After watching patients come to the emergency room for chronic diseases, Dr. Brent Asplin launched a primary care startup, Gather Health, to focus specifically on higher risk older people. The firm has signed up more than 2,500 patients, all of whom are 65 or older and on Medicare. And with $17 million in new funding, he projects revenue will explode by 25 times to reach $44 million this year. AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster and Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The Federal Election Commission, an independent agency charged with enforcing campaign finance laws, is issuing rulings and functioning with just four remaining members after President Donald Trump’s unprecedented firing of longtime Democratic member Ellen Weintraub. Following Weintraub’s ouster, which Democrats say is illegal, the agency now requires unanimous agreement to take any significant action, which is difficult considering it is often split along party lines. As Republicans seek to protect their tight majority in the House, President Donald Trump withdrew his nomination of Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) for United Nations Ambassador. Republicans hold just five more seats than Democrats in the House, after two GOP members resigned—controversial former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who took himself out of the running for Attorney General, and former Rep. Michael Waltz, who resigned to become Trump’s national security advisor. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed a United Nations-led temporary administration to govern Ukraine, said he believes President Donald Trump was sincere about ending the Ukraine war and suggested that Trump’s bid to annex Greenland was “rooted in history.” Putin, whose administration has repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of the Volodymyr Zelenskyy-led Ukrainian government, implied that such a temporary administration would be necessary for ending the war in Ukraine, though Zelenskyy and his administration have yet to respond. Shalom Meckenzie of Amp Shalom Meckenzie made a $1.4 billion fortune after merging his software company SBTech with DraftKings and going public via a SPAC. With his latest venture Amp Fitness, he’s hoping there’s a big business in at-home workouts. Amp’s business model is nearly identical to that of a slew of failed and struggling exercise companies like Tonal, Peloton and Mirror: Sell wealthy folks an expensive machine, hire a bunch of celebrity trainers, collect “data” and then pray you can make money by expanding into more profitable ancillary markets like personalized nutrition, subscriptions and apparel before the customers get bored and move on. It hasn’t worked for anyone else, but that’s not stopping Meckenzie, who is largely self-financing the company for now. A minimalist version of a cable crossover machine found at any gym, the wall-mounted Amp costs $2,000, and accessing the trainers (both AI and human) through the app requires a $23 monthly subscription. Amp, which launched sales in January, has hired a dozen or so fitness influencers and minor celebrities as trainers, the most famous of whom is America’s Got Talent host Terry Crews. Still, the connected at-home fitness device market is ultracompetitive and highly saturated. It boomed during the pandemic but is now littered with the shells of companies vastly better financed and much earlier to market than Amp. But Meckenzie has dealt with doubters before. “When I started SBTech, many people came to me and said, ‘Shalom, you’re stupid, you’re using all the money you have and [money] you don’t have, and you’re going to get you and your family in trouble,’ ” he says. “When people offend me, that’s what keeps me going.” WHY IT MATTERS “The at-home fitness market is rife with challenges, fads and fickle customers,” says Forbes staff writer Will Yakowicz. “After the pandemic-induced valuation boom went bust, companies like Peloton and Tonal fell back down to Earth, while products like Mirror were discontinued. Shalom Meckenzie believes his company Amp can avoid making similar mistakes incumbent companies made and says he has made a superior device infused with AI and other tech. At half the price of Tonal, it’s now up to the customers to decide.” MORE How A Swedish Fitness Toy Went Viral Thanks To Tom Brady, RFK Jr. And An Army Of Celebrities The latest target of the Trump Administration’s cost-cutting efforts is Health and Human Services, as agency head Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced layoffs Thursday. The job cuts are in addition to those who took an earlier layoff package, dramatically reducing the size of the agency: 10,000: The number of jobs being eliminated, in addition to 10,000 employees who left voluntarily 62,000: How many full-time employees will remain at the agency after the downsizing, down from about 82,000 18%: The share of CDC workers that will be impacted by the cuts President Donald Trump’s tariffs are expected to upend the economy and job market, especially in industries like agriculture and automotives. Job seekers should understand which industries face the most disruption, and which stand to benefit, such as domestic manufacturing or companies that help businesses adjust their supply chains. Make sure to develop versatile skills that can be used across a number of industries, and diversify your income through freelancing or other gig work while searching for a full-time role.

Title: Katy Perry and Lauren Sanchez’s Blue Origin space flight date confirmed
URL: https://www.celebitchy.com/915559/katy_perry_and_lauren_sanchezs_blue_origin_space_flight_date_confirmed/
Time Published: 2025-03-28T11:25:38Z

Hereâs a question Iâm sure plagues most brides: is it better to go into space before or after your wedding? So much goes into planning the big day, Iâd think a lot of people would opt for waiting to play astronaut until after. But Lauren SÃ¡nchez is not most people. When others say formal winter attire, Lauren hears uncovered bustier. So naturally the noted journalist, bestselling author, pilot, entrepreneur, philanthropist, chairperson, and future Mrs. Bezos, is going the other way (as in, away from Earth), and squeezing in an aerospace flight ahead of her nuptials. Fresh off of the confirmation this week that Lauren and Jeff are marrying in Venice this summer, Blue Origin (the groomâs company) has just announced their first all-woman space mission is set to blastoff on April 14. How do we know theyâre all set to launch? Because theyâve got the official mission patch graphic! Blue Origin is ready to send several superstars to space. The launch date for the upcoming flight, which will include Katy Perry, Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyá» n, Gayle King, Kerianne Flynn and Lauren SÃ¡nchez, was confirmed this week. New Shepardâs NS-31 11th human flight will be Monday, April 14. It will lift off from Launch Site One in West Texas. The New Shepard launch window opens at 8:30 a.m. CDT / 13:30 UTC. Additionally, Blue Origin released the NS-31 mission patch. Per the company, a few of the key symbols embedded include: The target star symbolizes Aisha Boweâs ambition for setting big goals, passion for STEM, and commitment to inspiring future generations. The scales of justice symbolize Amanda Nguyá» nâs efforts to advocate for civil rights, break barriers, and empower everyday people to create change. The shooting star microphone represents Gayle Kingâs commitment to sharing important stories with the world. The firework symbolizes Katy Perryâs global influence across music, pop culture, and philanthropy. The film reel symbolizes Kerianne Flynnâs passion for filmmaking, storytelling, and crafting beautiful narratives. Flynn the Fly, the main character in Lauren SÃ¡nchezâs bestselling childrenâs book, The Fly Who Flew to Space, is along for the ride. The story is about overcoming adversity, inspiring kids with learning differences to pursue their dreams. [From Just Jared] Real talk: how likely is it that the designer of that mission patch got paid an astronomically higher fee than anyone makes at Amazon? Also, âThe firework symbolizes Katy Perryâs global influence across music, pop culture, and philanthropy,â made me chuckle. Why not just say itâs a nod to her song?! Katy was recently confirmed to be on Lauren and Jeffâs wedding guest list, as was Gayle King. So my next question is: is New Shepard NS-31 the bachelorette party? If so, I hope the invites said, âWill be out of this world!â (I know, I know, Iâm hilarious.) In all seriousness, I hope the flight runs smoothly and safely, and that all women aboard make it back in time for the weddingâ¦ and the rest of their lives. The recent spate of layoffs at Blue Origin has me worried, which probably wonât go away until after this whole unnecessary joyride once in a lifetime experience is over. And on top of that, the takeoff is in West Texas, currently battling an entirely preventable measles outbreak. The world is so fun right now.

Um… anyway, I hope they all have a lovely time in space and come back in one piece. Reply Smart&Messy says: March 28, 2025 at 7:34 am No she can’t, not without lifting her chin up weirdly. Same as Demi Moore. Both had very overdone liplifts. I observed a similar strained chin movement with Kate Hudson in Running Point, but to a lesser extent. They all look the same when they try to eat, for example, when you actually need to close your lips sometimes. Try to lift your upper lip with a finger right under your nose and try to speak or close you mouth. So noticeable. Reply StillDouchesOfCambridge says: March 28, 2025 at 7:57 am Thereâs a weird little crooked gap on the top lip, but her hair seems so healthy & soft and her lashes look great. Hope the flight goes well. Reply Kebbie says: March 28, 2025 at 8:03 am Thatâs putting it mildly lol her upper lip is completely deformed Cherry says: March 28, 2025 at 7:26 am I so, so hate this. We get to watch this dumb nonsense and at the same time see our hard-earned basic rights and decades-long fight for equality being obliterated in the course of a few years. But sure, great. Katy Perry and Lauren Sanchez will go to space. Congrats. Reply Tate says: March 28, 2025 at 7:31 am Itâs all so gross. Reply Kitten says: March 28, 2025 at 8:52 am This is what weirdo rich people enjoy doing. Wish they’d take a few more billionaires with them TBH. Reply HelloDannie says: March 28, 2025 at 11:23 am Yes ð¯ donât eat the rich, send em out to space instead ðð L4Frimaire says: March 28, 2025 at 12:04 pm This right here! This is fake go girl feminism while Bezos censors the Washington Post and cozies up to the Trump administration that is dismantling the government and our rights. If Trump says anything negative about this flight, wouldnât be surprised if Bezos cancels it. Reply Traveller says: March 29, 2025 at 10:59 am Exactly this. Incredibly bad optics for all involved – Cozying up to a trump ass-kissing oligarch while the U.S. slides further and further into the fascist abyss. I guess as long as nothing will affect them why should they be worried about the rest of the country. Deering24 says: March 28, 2025 at 9:38 pm Very Gilded Ageâthe rich show off/fund achievements while the rest of us are kicked down to ladderâs bottom, where we should applaud them. Reply Smart&Messy says: March 28, 2025 at 7:30 am I hope she consulted her plastic surgeon before signing up. I’d be wary of any physical impact even on a simple commercial flight with that amount of implants, fillers, threads, nips and tucks. Reply Giddy says: March 28, 2025 at 10:47 am If I were Lauren I would ask my doctor if my boobs would maybe explode at great altitude. Reply Zut Alors says: March 28, 2025 at 7:42 am Is it possible that Lauren Sanchez just does not photograph well? That in real life, she doesn’t look so jarring. Because, yikes. Why would anyone do this to themselves? Reply Kitten says: March 28, 2025 at 8:48 am It’s particularly depressing because she was beauty back in the day. https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/lauren-sanchez-and-patrick-whitesell-news-photo/83129527 Reply Flamingo says: March 28, 2025 at 11:32 am I remember back in the day when Lauren was one of the hosts on Extra. I thought she was so beautiful. Then she left to be an ‘actress’. I guess she did what many women of beauty do. When you don’t succeed in your career. You marry rich, then richer. Lordy what she has done to her face and body should be a crime trying to cling to youth. When one Jocelyn Wildenstein dies another rises in her place. Mslove says: March 28, 2025 at 7:53 am I’m getting OceanGate Titan vibes. Yeah, I know they’re going in the opposite direction. I would never go to space before my wedding, especially if my greedy fiancee were in charge of the rocket ship. Because if he’s having second thoughts, well, you never know. Reply Ponchorella says: March 28, 2025 at 10:31 am That was my first thought as well! Reply Meredith says: March 31, 2025 at 7:17 pm Yes!

Reply Lenn says: March 28, 2025 at 8:35 am I cannot take Gayle seriously as a journalist anymore. Reply Traveller says: March 29, 2025 at 11:02 am Agreed. Such a selfish stunt to be involved with in the face of what’s happening to the rest of us in this country. She’s a big disappointment. Reply Kitten says: March 28, 2025 at 8:49 am Sounds like a Marxist-woke-commie-DEI rocket based on those symbols. Reply lanne says: March 28, 2025 at 9:04 am It’s the world’s most expensive horsey-ride. I’d bow out if I were Perry or King.

Reply Veronica S. says: March 29, 2025 at 7:12 pm I love that Sanchez looks worse every time we see her lol. I just want to know if, in their world, it’s so normalized people can’t see it, or is she the one people whisper and nudge each other about at parties? Laughing forever at how much Katy Perry clearly wants to be a Republican, though. She’s just chomping at the bit waiting for it to socially acceptable again for a major pop star to be MAGA.

Title: Is AMZN Stock Still A Growth Engine?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team Contributor. AMZN Stock Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) has declined by around 10% so far this year, as investors grow increasingly concerned about the possibility of escalating trade disputes. President Trump has floated a 25% tariff on auto imports and indicated that more tariffs could be levied on European and Canadian products if he believes they harm the U.S. economy.[1] Still, AMZN stock is up 145% when measured from early 2023, thanks largely to three key drivers: We'll take a closer look at these dynamics. For more details, check out our dashboard on Why Amazon Stock Moved. While AMZN has seen a strong run-up, if you’re looking for upside potential with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has beaten the S&P with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Amazon’s solid revenue growth is fueled by long-term trends in e-commerce, streaming, and digital advertising. As the leading player in U.S. online retail with a 38% market share, Amazon benefits from multiple revenue streams, especially through its innovative advertising model, which generates income from both ad placements and resulting sales. A key to this growth has been Amazon’s diversification strategy, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) playing a major role. From 2020 to 2024, AWS grew at an average annual rate of 24.4%, far exceeding the growth of its North America (13.2%) and International (8.7%) operations. This underscores the impact of Amazon’s long-term investments in infrastructure, including data centers, e-commerce tools, and logistics networks. Looking forward, while AWS remains a crucial growth engine, Amazon faces rising competition in cloud computing. Rivals like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are gaining ground. Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI and its aggressive AI investments could give it an edge, while Google continues to expand its generative AI offerings. These developments highlight the need for Amazon to continue innovating to maintain its leadership in the tech sector. After years of scaling operations, Amazon is now beginning to realize the payoff of its strategic investments. Its adaptability and focus across high-growth industries continue to reinforce its position in the digital economy. AWS has played a pivotal role in Amazon’s financial evolution, helping to significantly boost profitability. From 2022 to 2024, Amazon’s operating margin surged from 2.4% to 10.8% — a five-fold increase. This improved profitability, paired with strong revenue growth and AWS’s rapid expansion, has shifted investor sentiment in Amazon’s favor. During this period, Amazon’s price-to-sales multiple nearly doubled from 1.7x to 3.4x, signaling renewed confidence in its growth outlook. This rebound came amid broader market turmoil, especially the inflation-driven market sell-off in 2022. At the time, Amazon stock dropped sharply — down 52% from a January 2022 peak of $170.40 to $81.82 by December. That decline outpaced the S&P 500’s 25.4% fall. It wasn’t until February 2024 that AMZN recovered to its prior high, demonstrating both the stock’s volatility and resilience. Now trading at $200, Amazon's stock carries a P/S ratio of 3.4x, roughly in line with its five-year average of 3.2x. Still, there are solid reasons to believe the multiple could rise further. Amazon’s aggressive investments in artificial intelligence offer significant upside across several business segments. Within AWS, a surge in AI-driven app development is expected to drive increased demand for cloud infrastructure. On the retail side, AI-powered enhancements in product recommendations, search, and personalization could meaningfully lift performance. These improvements are likely to boost conversion rates, increase average order values, and improve advertising efficiency both on Amazon’s platform and beyond. Sales are expected to grow at a low double-digit pace in the coming years, with profits projected to grow even faster. With rising profitability, ongoing AWS momentum, and sustained dominance in e-commerce, Amazon may see further expansion in its valuation multiple. Investors could view these strategies as strong catalysts for future gains. We estimate Amazon’s valuation at $244 per share — about 20% above current levels — based on a P/S multiple of 4.1x, 20% higher than the current 3.4x. Notably, the increase in AMZN stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While AMZN may still have room to climb, it’s worth exploring how Amazon’s Peers stack up on key financial metrics. You can find more comparisons across industries on Peer Comparisons.

Title: Rolling Consumer Boycotts Stalk Amazon, Target And Tesla

ByDeArbea Walker ByDeArbea Walker Forbes Staff. Consumers are organizing "#TeslaTakedown" protests online to show their anger toward CEO Elon Musk. Consumer activists have launched rolling economic boycotts of Target, Amazon and other recognizable companies in recent weeks to protest DEI rollbacks and policies seemingly aimed at appeasing the Trump administration. The outcome of these campaigns hinges on how deeply the companies feel their effects and whether consumers can find suitable alternatives. The People's Union USA, a consumer advocacy group organizing many of the boycotts, has set its sights this week on Nestlé, for what the group's founder John Schwarz says is the company's failure to address allegations of toxic ingredients and unethical business practices. This action follows calls to boycott retailers Amazon and Target for rollbacks to their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Nestlé did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, anger toward the electric vehicle maker Tesla has boiled over as public antipathy toward its CEO, Elon Musk, seems to have grown since he became the Trump administration's chief cost-cutter. These consumer initiatives may indicate the start of a "Great Rejection," which is gaining momentum online to stop spending on nonessential goods, Greg Petro, Forbes Investing contributor, says. “Whether or not a recession is in the cards this year, the evidence is clear that frustration stalks the retail aisles,” Petro writes. Consumers don’t stop spending altogether during boycotts, opening up opportunities for small businesses to attract new customers looking for alternatives, Forbes entrepreneurs contributor Allyson Kapin writes. “Boycotts are not strictly a matter of withholding business. Rather, they’re a redirection — a re-allocation — of spending power,” Kapin says. Black parishioners’ boycott of Target began March 5 and runs through April 17. Black and Latino consumer groups have avoided Target and Walmart, noting the retailers' announced rollbacks of their DEI policies late last year. During The People’s Union USA’s Feb. 28 Economic Blackout, Target saw a 9% drop in foot traffic and a 14% drop in web traffic, according to Similarweb. “For now, at least in the short term, it seems that these boycotts are having an effect, but the question is how long it will last,” Forbes contributor Doug Melville writes. Black activists are focusing on Target because they see the company's about-face on DEI frustrating after its outspokenness during the Black Lives Matter protests after George Floyd was killed in 2020, Pam Danziger, a Forbes retail contributor writes. Target, which is headquartered in Minneapolis, where Floyd was murdered, had committed to purchasing $2 billion worth of goods from Black businesses by the end of 2025. And the retailer promised to increase its Black workforce by 20% and pledged to establish an executive Racial Equity Action and Change committee. “Target seems to be particularly vulnerable,” Danziger writes, noting the company was seen as "a high-profile partner in the diversity, equity and inclusion movement, only to be perceived as abandoning the cause.” "We would expect some loyalty, some decency and some camaraderie,” Rev. Jamal Bryant, senior pastor of Atlanta’s New Birth Missionary Baptist Church and lead voice of the 40-day economic boycott, told CNN. Black parishioners’ boycott of Target began March 5 and runs through April 17. Target declined to comment but pointed Forbes to a statement it released in January, when it announced rollbacks of DEI initiatives. It reads in part: “We remain focused on driving our business by creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities through a commitment to inclusion.” Target has been one of the most visible brands to raise the ire of consumer activists, and the retailer may face its biggest test this week when stores offer up to 40% off for Circle Week — slated to go head-to-head with Amazon’s Prime Week. Data from the sales "should be able to paint a better picture of these consumer efforts," Melville says. Amazon, which was the subject of a week-long boycott earlier this month, has shown some resilience, according to Forbes retail contributor Kiri Masters. The e-commerce giant saw a 6% uptick in traffic from the previous eight weeks when The People’s Union USA boycotted March 7 to 14, according to Momentum Commerce. Before the Amazon boycott, 9% of shoppers planned to participate, but when the time came, the data showed a different story, according to Masters. “The disparity between stated boycott intentions and sales impact underscores a well-documented gap between what consumers say they’ll do and what they actually do,” Masters says. With consumers participating in a variety of boycotts and protests, small businesses wonder if there will be an opportunity for them to win customers. The grocery space offers some insights. Since 2020, consumer spending at farmers’ markets has increased more than 20%, according to the USDA Economic Research Service. Consumers seem to be gravitating to farmers' markets looking for more locally sourced and safer food options, Stephanie Gravalese, a Forbes dining contributor writes. “If the blackout encourages even a fraction of participants to shift toward local alternatives, it could reinforce an existing movement prioritizing small food businesses over corporate chains — a shift that may already be underway,” Gravalese writes. However, while consumers look for non-corporate options for everyday goods, many fear a complete drop-off in consumer spending in response to the boycotts. Inflation, perhaps stiffened by tariffs, and uncertainty over the future of the labor market have left consumers feeling uneasy. Last month, consumer confidence dropped seven points to its lowest level since 2021, according to The Conference Board, a nonpartisan think tank. “While the Great Rejection is not a real thing yet, it is an idea that consumers are warming to — spend less and save more — that could be with us for some time to come,” Petro writes. Even with boycotts planned through the summer, Shelley Kohan, a Forbes retail contributor, writes that the biggest question is how can consumers voice their fury without tanking the economy. While the boycotts aim “to challenge corporate power through collective consumer action, small business owners highlight the delicate economic ecosystem is at stake,” Kohan says. Tesla sales have been down worldwide, with the most dramatic drop in Europe. It's not just DEI cuts that have some consumers upset. The #Teslatakedown social media campaign targets Tesla, one of the largest and most recognizable electric car makers, led by Musk. “Every action he makes is met with an equal reaction online, often with the hashtag,” Peter Suciu, a Forbes social media contributor writes of Musk. Musk, the world’s richest man and the CEO of SpaceX, Starlink, X and Tesla, has been one of the most visible and prolific fundraisers and supporters of President Trump and backed far-right political parties in the U.K. and Germany. With Trump's blessing, Musk has overseen mass layoffs and spending cuts across the federal government in his role as head of the Department Of Government Efficiency. Musk has defended DOGE, saying that the project, aimed at cutting up to $2 trillion in government money, is addressing what he sees as widespread fraud in federal spending. However, Musk has been met with fierce backlash from the public, especially as he’s turned his attention to popular programs like Medicaid and Social Security. “Stealing from Social Security is not easy,” Forbes senior contributor Howard Gleckman writes. “The agency tracks employment and payroll tax payments for all workers with a Social Security number and automatically calculates old age benefits. It is very hard to game that system.” “The real risk," Gleckman says: "Trump Administration efforts to fire thousands of Social Security employees will reduce their ability to catch fraud.” Consumer dissatisfaction with Musk has already slowed Tesla's growth. Since late last year, sales have decreased worldwide, with the most dramatic drop in Germany — down 76%. The company's share price has also fallen 43% since Inauguration Day, and more than $650 billion has been wiped from the company's valuation. Musk's fortune has shrunk $104 billion, according to Forbes' wealth estimates. “There are several reasons for Tesla's poor results, such as the changeover of the Model Y, falling Model 3 sales and stronger competition from rival EVs," Peter Lyon, a Forbes cars and bikes contributor writes. "Industry analysts have also put some blame for Tesla’s slump in Germany on local dissent at Musk's interference in local elections and support of the far-right AfD party.” Protests against Musk and Tesla have taken different forms: While some Tesla owners have joined consumer activism efforts by trading in their vehicles, other protests have included vandalism. How much retailers will feel the effects of consumer boycotts is still unknown, and whether or not shoppers will find lasting alternatives to the retail giants remains to be seen. “Given the increasing political divide in the country, politics is infiltrating many non-political dimensions of life, like shopping,” Danziger says. The key for retailers, big and small, may be to proceed cautiously. Kapin points out that small businesses may have opportunities while shoppers are frustrated with the big retailers. But in some ways, all retailers’ prospects are linked. “The tension between consumer activism and economic reality sits at the heart of this economic blackout debate,” Kohan writes. “While The People’s Union USA’s campaign aims to challenge corporate power through collective consumer action, small business owners highlight the delicate economic ecosystem is at stake.”

Title: Tech has a new power base in DC

Time Published: 2025-03-28T09:00:01Z

Washington, DC, investors have long hoped to make the capital a tech startup hub. In Trump's second term, those ambitions are finally taking hold. The new presidential administration has brought a number of Silicon Valley heavyweights to Washinton. Big names in tech and venture capital like Tesla's Elon Musk and Andreessen Horowitz's Scott Kupor now hold positions in the federal government, while other Big Tech billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg are spending more time in Washington, hoping to exert their influence on new tech policies. Washington is already seeing rising VC interest — the top-tier venture firms Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst have opened offices in the area in the past year, and hot defense tech startups with significant DC footprints, such as Anduril, are landing more checks and contracts. Just last week, A16z hosted an "American Dynamism" conference in Washington, with opening remarks by Vice President JD Vance. "It's time to align the interests of our technology firms with the interests of the United States of America writ large," Vance said at the summit. Now, Washington is welcoming a wave of tech elites, many with backgrounds in startups and VC, that are "startup curious," said James Barlia, the executive director of the startup incubator Station DC. "There's a new power base that's forming in DC, and it's creating a real opportunity for founders," he said. Paige Soya, a managing partner at K St Capital, a local VC firm and angel syndicate, said the arrival of the tech aristocracy, along with other affluent officials in Trump's administration, is driving a real estate rush for luxury multimillion-dollar properties in the district — and bringing the potential for those elites to angel invest in local startups. "A lot of these people would have never thought of DC as a place to find good deals. But because they're here, they're organically starting to see it. I think that's going to impact funding on its own," she said. Barlia is optimistic that tech's elevated presence in the district will do more than bring money to the DC startup community: It could inject Washington with a dose of Silicon Valley's culture of disruption. "I feel like there's now deeper connectivity between Silicon Valley and DC, including ideologically and philosophically," he said. In the past year, as AI took over Silicon Valley and Trump effused a pro-tech, anti-AI-regulation stance during his presidential campaign, several powerful VCs emerged to support Trump's administration. Delian Asparouhov, a partner at Founder's Fund, posted on X after Trump chose Vance as his running mate, '"IT'S JD VANCE. WE HAVE A FORMER TECH VC IN THE WHITE HOUSE. GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH BABY." Their exuberance brings new momentum to DC's tech ecosystem, which has been steadily growing as startups seek government contracts and influence on Capitol Hill. The district now boasts the fifth-most-developed VC ecosystem in the US, according to PitchBook, despite being the country's 23rd-largest city, per 2022 Census data. Tech giants like Palantir, which runs an office in Georgetown, and Microsoft, which has offices in Washington's Mt. Vernon Square and across the Potomac in Arlington, Virginia, have helped draw in tech and investment talent over time. Now, VC firms like A16z and General Catalyst aren't the only ones interested in the DMV's startup scene — the district itself is now betting on area startups. Mayor Muriel Bowser launched DC's first Venture Capital Program in December, with $26 million to invest in early-stage DC startups. Soya's K St Capital was picked to manage the funds. Every dollar of public funding has to be matched by private funding, Soya noted, so DC startups could receive up to $52 million through the program. K St Capital has been building its DC firm for over a decade alongside other early-stage investors such as Saas Ventures, founded in 2017. Newer projects such as District Angels launched last year to pool local angel investors to back DC startups. However, while the Trump administration has forged a newfound alliance with the tech industry, the Department of Government Efficiency's slew of cuts to federal agencies could threaten the industry's growth in Washinton. The district's chief financial officer has estimated that the layoffs could cost DC more than 40,000 jobs over the next four years. But Barlia said he thinks Elon Musk's much-criticized push to "trim the fat" in the federal government will make Washington stronger. "Elon's approach may make some people uncomfortable, but the underlying problem is undeniable. Yes, there's near-term disruption — RIFs and potential economic contraction — but in the long run, it should push DC to build a more resilient, opportunity-rich economy," he said. "That won't come from more government or big corporate jobs, but by embracing new ideas, startups, and innovation." Washington is, first and foremost, a government town, with an inherent federal bureaucracy that's at odds with many startups' "move fast and break things" ethos, said John Doyle, a former Palantir executive and the founder of the defense startup Cape. Still, Doyle and Barlia said they're seeing interest from federal agencies, particularly the Department of Defense, to work with startups and move fast — faster than is typical of the government, at least. Chris Morales, a Point72 Ventures defense tech partner who's based in DC, pointed to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's March memo about the DoD's plans to modernize how it acquires software and contracts with companies. Morales said the memo is one of multiple signs his firm is seeing that the agency is getting more serious about tech innovation. While Soya and Barlia said they're seeing startups across various industries gain traction in Washington, defense tech easily remains the hottest among them. Cape landed its first contract with the Department of Defense in 2023 in a deal to provide its cybersecurity-focused mobile carrier services to Naval forces in Guam after a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group targeted the base's tech infrastructure. Cape has since raised $61 million in financing rounds led by Andreessen Horowitz and A*, announced in April 2024. Doyle said part of the reason Cape picked DC as its headquarters was to rub shoulders with the federal agencies it hoped to partner with. As he said, "proximity matters." It's no surprise then that a number of defense tech startups have opened offices in Washington, including Anduril, which recently raised $1.5 billion at a $14 billion valuation in August, and Shield AI, which raised $240 million this month in a funding round that valued the autonomous drone maker at $5.3 billion. Startups in the DMV can also tap into the area's hard tech talent, which could help continue to boost the area's presence as a tech hub. Northern Virginia hosts one of the world's largest concentrations of data centers. Amazon opened its second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, in 2023. Other tech giants, including Microsoft and Google, have outposts in the area. And many of the country's largest aerospace and defense companies, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are headquartered in the DMV. Doyle said the DMV's deep bench of technical expertise has helped Cape find numerous backend engineers in the area. He admitted, though, that Washington has a smaller candidate pool than traditional tech hubs like San Francisco and New York City. Cape also has a New York office, for which Doyle said it's generally easier to source talent, especially front-end engineers and designers. As some VCs flock to the DC area, others are fleeing. Sequoia Capital plans to shutter its DC office at the end of March and cut its policy team there, despite other major VC firms moving in. A Sequoia spokesperson told BI that the firm built its policy team in DC to strengthen its connections and its portfolio companies' connections with policymakers and other experts. The policy team set Sequoia up favorably to carry those relationships forward in the US and Europe, the spokesperson said. Khosla Ventures managing director Keith Rabois said at a conference in February that Washington "definitely still is not where early-stage venture capitalists should be spending too much time," despite saying he'd recently run into Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in the city. DC's venture scene may not yet rival San Francisco's, but it's feeling fresh momentum nonetheless. A16z's American Dynamism Summit largely set out to connect San Francisco's VC ecosystem with Washington policymakers, but DC-based investors were also in attendance this year, said Jonathan Lacoste, a general partner at Austin-based Space VC, who attended the conference. "There were plenty of investors at the event, not just from the West Coast, but increasingly from DC's venture landscape too," he told BI. As DC's tech community grows, so does its appetite for more networking opportunities. Catherine McMillan, an analyst at the tech-focused consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, founded the DC chapter of the GenAI Collective, a generative AI networking nonprofit started in San Francisco in 2023. McMillan also helps run two other tech communities in the district: DC Tech Parties and She's In Tech. McMillan's DC chapter of the GenAI collective now has 700 members, with each event bringing in fresh faces. "It's an undervalued tech market because it doesn't have the same level of visibility that SF or New York have. That's part of what I'm trying to do, shed a light on the cool entrepreneurial things that are happening in the DMV," she said. "We have a Big Tech presence, but we also have an ecosystem in its own right." Jump to

Title: The State of OTT and CTV Monetization 2025
URL: https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=168651
Time Published: 2025-03-28T08:35:00Z

There’s an old saying about advertising: “Half the money spent on advertising is working; we just don’t know which half.” The same could be said about the comments you hear regarding the state of advertising. Or maybe it’s our expectations more than our perceptions that don’t match reality. Conversation about monetization is so nuanced that after a decade of writing on this topic, I am still looking for meaning where there may be little to find. Essentially, what I’ve come to understand is that ad­vertising is like the stock market: Certain aspects of advertising deals are not transparent now and may never become fully transparent. What is clear, ac­cording to research from Statista, is that 64% of rev­enue growth in the U.S. in OTT is coming from ad­vertising. More details on that in a moment. The expectation that buying advertising should be the same in streaming as it is in linear TV is unrealis­tic. “When buyers traditionally bought TV, they were able to see exactly where their campaigns were run­ning—show and time—and theoretically, they knew exactly how many people watched,” says Tameka Kee, SVP of programming and operations at the Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement (CIMM). “When it comes to streaming, none of that is true. Buyers do deserve to know where and how their campaigns run, but I think that they’re holding streaming to a higher standard than they held TV to.” Regardless of what ad buyers expect, the more phil­osophical question is, “Why should TV and streaming be the same?” “In the past 12–18 months, as an indus­try, we’ve been far more open to things we were never open to before,” says Karen Babcock, VP of advertis­ing strategy and partnerships at Comcast. “Looking back 10 years, advertisers, for all intents and pur­poses, bought [gross rating points], and they bought spots. And when they did that, they were buying it based off of the content it was running in.” They were really buying audiences, she contends, but preferred to think of them as content. “With the growth of streaming,” Babcock explains, “this whole idea of ‘What content am I landing in’ and ‘I bought this show for this reason’ is almost trans­formed into, ‘I need to reach Nadine somewhere where is she watching,’ and ‘How can I find a way to reach her at the right amount of times?’” For better or worse, there’s a lot more information floating out there today about me and every other consumer, so answers to those questions are more readily available now than they were a decade ago. Everyone, of course, speaks about targeting viewers in a privacy-compliant way, although the accuracy of that phrase seems open to debate. As a refresher, advertising, in the best circumstanc­es, is bought based on content channel, ratings, genre, and audience. “It’s trying to make sure you’re sending the right identifiers, so the advertiser can choose how they want to match their audience,” says Reed Barker, head of advertising at Philo. These identifiers can in­clude Unified ID 2.0 (UID2), Google’s PAIR, Yahoo Con­nectID, Epsilon’s COREid, LiveRamp’s RampId, etc. The advertiser is bidding on a block of known data, which in the U.S. includes identifiers created by var­ious groups. The Trade Desk describes its UID2 as “an identity fabric for the open internet.” In this and other identifiers, data is hashed so it remains spe­cific about a consumer’s interests, but not specific to a person, with direct identifiers removed. However, anonymous details like age, income, and education remain, plus other data that enhances advertisers’ ability to target viewers. Then, device ID and IP ad­dress are thrown into a Venn diagram-like graph, with the resulting intersection of a cohort who likes a certain thing, lives in a particular place, makes a certain amount of money, and has specific beliefs. For a subscription service, this will also be matched to subscriber’s information if they’re authenticated. The nature of modern streaming is that the ser­vices were started by many different companies, and ad buyers need to work within this realm. Psycholo­gists say the dynamic of doing the same thing (in this case, buying advertising in streaming) and expecting a different result is not going to get you very far. You really need to change, whether you want to or not. The question is, “Will this advertising market actu­ally adapt to the new normal of streaming?” Expecting digital to be bought the same way as linear is not re­alistic, no matter how much people want it to be. How­ever, the business of advertising seems to be ticking along fairly well if you look at overall stats. Statista reports on the revenue of what it classifies as OTT. This includes digital media distribution by SVOD, digital purchases via download or permanent cloud storage (electronic sell-through, or EST), OTT video advertising, and FAST services, such as Pluto TV or Tubi. In the U.S., Statista notes, revenue is expected to reach $146.30 billion in 2025. The largest revenue share in OTT belongs to video advertising, with an ex­pected 2025 U.S. revenue of $93.88 billion. U.S. annual growth rate is pegged at 7.25%, and OTT has captured 71.7% of U.S. consumers. However, YouTube has 16% of this market. The average revenue per user (ARPU) Statista reports for OTT is $593.30. I think it’s safe to say we’re in the late stage of consumer adoption. Other regions’ general adoption is as follows: Statista also predicts a compound annual growth rate of 5.8% for Latin America for 2025–2029, result­ing in a projected market volume of $14.56 billion. There has been a business model ping-pong match of subscriptions, ad-supported content (later to in­clude FAST), subscriptions with ads, transactional content, and even outright content purchases. In 2024–2025, advertising came out on top. “If you’re depending on a single revenue model, then you’re sort of stuck at the whims of the mar­ketplace,” says Philo’s Barker. “You want to have at least a baseline of guaranteed dollars, which comes from subscriptions. I’d like to have the same margin on the subscription, and if I’m not going to get it, if it has ads, then I’m going to have extra margin from ads so I can charge less for the subscription. Where is the profit coming from?” One wonders if that means the ad-supported mod­el has a larger potential for growth. “It does, but you can only show so many ads to people based on how engaged they are with your platform,” Barker says. “There’s still a finite number of hours that people watch TV and a finite number of ads you can show in an ad-supported environment. I’ve seen multiple people talk about how inventory has grown about 20%, and demand is growing around 13%. I think that’s across the industry, and everybody is seeing it.” One reason for this trend could be fragmentation. Another could simply be how easy it is to buy adver­tising elsewhere. “Search and social have done a tremendous job mak­ing the buy flow for an advertiser so simple, anybody could log on,” says Comcast’s Babcock. “Digital premi­um video has been 10 times harder to buy than it ever should have been. It’s so different and so much more complex than so many other businesses because it’s 20,000 line items every single month that want $1,000 targeted to three ZIP codes in the U.S. over these 7 days. Trying to do forecasting and optimizations is complex because of just sheer volume.” Babcock says that one of the biggest challenges or­ganizations like Comcast face in 2025 is, “If an ad­vertiser has a million dollars to spend today, how do they get it into the system and running tomorrow? Be­cause right now, that level of automation is not there. Do they have video creative that is transcoded to the right specs? Is it approved? What publishers can it run on? What pace do they need? Those are the things that we’re working on automating this year,” she says. One way Comcast is addressing this issue is through partnerships like the ad tech platform deal the company’s FreeWheel expanded with Roku in De­cember 2024. “That wouldn’t have existed 5 years ago because everybody looked at each other as competi­tion,” Babcock says. “Now we’re realizing the compe­tition isn’t so much ourselves—it’s search and social that have made the buying so easy.” In addition to the ease of buying on search and so­cial, finding the target audience has become much harder, since consumers have a bounty of choice. “It’s such a fragmented landscape,” says Sarah Monahan, co-head of enterprise ad sales at Roku. “Sports is just one example where it used to be a very straightfor­ward path to find my NBA game, and now there are so many passive entries and also so many different platforms, apps, OSs, and ways to access my content. I’m unclear what my consumer is doing. We spent a lot of time educating our advertising community on this household shift [where viewers] cut the cord. Be­lieve it or not, 88% of their time was spent watching completely free ad-supported content.” Another trend that continued to ramp up in 2024 was programmatic buying, in which automated buy­ing, based on data, budgets, and opportunity, can be handled much more efficiently for many advertising buys. Nearly all large and many smaller companies have a self-serve programmatic offering. Disney an­nounced in 2024 that 50% of its inventory is bought this way, and the company is targeting it to reach 75% by 2027. NBCUniversal had programmatic sales available for the 2024 Paris Olympics. In addition, the company claims to use generative AI to analyze content across its portfolio, paired with its first-party datasets, to pro­duce emotion-based, AI-powered audience segments. As previously mentioned, in December 2024, Roku announced that it expanded its programmatic part­nership with FreeWheel to make Roku content, in­cluding The Roku Channel, available to FreeWheel partners via the Roku Exchange. This will enable real-time bidding among programmatic platforms, with the intent to offer advertisers more of the audiences they are looking for. Location, location, location. CTV operating system companies that are lucky enough to have a home screen environment to sell are continuing to opti­mize their real estate. Home screen ads “are the bulk of our inventory,” says Chris Hock, Whale TV’s VP of monetization. “When you turn on the TV and you get to the home screen, there’s a big, beautiful masthead that takes over the upper portion of the screen, with some kind of navigation overlay under it. That’s a great placement opportunity.” Home screen display ads in LG webOS While this inventory has been around for a while, the type of companies buying it has changed. “The home screen is an entry point that 120 million peo­ple a day see in the U.S.,” says Roku’s Monahan. “For the first time in 2024, we started to allow advertisers to integrate into our home screen in a way that we had not before. It had been historically really limit­ed to M&E. In Q4, a lot of our streamers saw really interesting brand experiences funded by Macy’s for Cyber Monday.” “What we’ve been doing for a long time for interac­tive program guides,” says Craig Chinn, TiVo’s SVP of advertising sales for the Americas, is to “have banners within linear channels. As people are looking through their channels, they can actually click on those inter­active program guide banners and find things that they’re going to do on our homepage hero ad.” The one thing all of these companies have in com­mon is that this inventory is exclusive and a direct buy. “IAB Tech Lab has started to do some work around CTV formats where this masthead ad will stick out and get some specifications around it so it’s easier to buy across different connected TV OSs,” says Hock. These companies and others hold the major proper­ties on the OTT Monopoly board, but let’s turn our at­tention to a few disrupters. These may seem like fringe use cases, but they are an important step in moving the conversation away from “We need change” to “Here’s what change looks like.” A number of companies spoke to me about contex­tual advertising, including Gracenote and Bitmovin. (See more on Bitmovin in The State of Generative AI 2025.) “A lot of the techniques that people have used in browsers to do audience-based advertising are not as effective in CTV,” says Trent Wheeler, Gracenote’s chief product officer. “Contextual can serve both as a way to help to identify the type of content and also to allow more interesting use cases and brand con­nection.” Gracenote launched contextual last year along with Magnite. Customers include Cineverse, DIRECTV Advertising, Philo, Tastemade, and Xumo. “Gracenote Contextual builds on the company’s metadata used for recommendation, but helps pub­lishers position their content to the demand side, to the advertiser market overall,” says Wheeler. “The most straightforward example is live sports con­tent. It is actually very hard to tell in a live sporting event how important or exciting a particular event is. For advertisers, it’s a complex data flow. We will very clearly mark the content, ‘Here’s live sports.’ We can even do things like tell you the score of the game or tell you how close it is. So, if you want to advertise in particularly exciting segments or close segments, those are datasets we could provide.” With the extent of fragmentation in CTV, Wheeler continues, “Audience information is harder to get. There are a lot of different, smaller pockets of in­ventory across CTV. The market is huge. I’ve seen estimates between 30 and 40 billion in regard to CTV advertising, and obviously the promise is, ‘Take what you like about TV advertising and the digital eco­system, and combine them together.’” If you look at TV advertising revenue over the last year, it has been pretty flat. “The best example I have for this is our main customer in Europe called TF1, the biggest channel in Europe,” says Mathias Guille, VP of cloud platform at Broadpeak. “They earn around 1.5 billion euros [annually], and that has been pretty flat for the past 20 years. Business growth is 1%–2% every year. If you compare that to Facebook or Meta in France, every year, they have double-digit growth. How do you explain that difference? TF1 is working with 500 advertisers on TV. Facebook and Meta in France have 500,000 advertisers.” Many companies have thought this same thing and have set up self-serve platforms where SMB buyers can purchase advertising in streaming as easily as you can on social. “If you can bring more advertisers every day to your platform, this is where you get more revenue. They may have smaller budgets, but they bring more growth across the platform,” says Guille. Broadpeak was looking at creating a different type of ad product. “If you have a small budget, you want to pay per click (otherwise called performance marketing),” Guille says. “You don’t want to pay per impression because impressions don’t bring in new conversions. TV needs to bring what we call perfor­mance metrics—it needs actually to tell advertisers the number of clicks, the interest, and what you gen­erate with the ad.” The key challenge, Guille notes, “is to make ads on TV clickable. In the last year, you’ve seen a lot of initia­tives with people putting QR codes on ads, and that’s the first step, because if people can scan the QR code, then you can know how many times they scan the QR code. But that’s not enough.” Guille goes on to say that the QR code is too compli­cated for people to use and that the target should be the click itself. “With a click, especially on the remote, you don’t think about it. You send a notification to your phone; you can look at that later on,” he explains. With­in the SDK used for measurement, viewers can pass the URL for a click. “So, typically, when we request the ad from the ad server, we get the creative, but we also get the URL of the product. The reason that no one is using that on TV today is because there’s nowhere to put that URL. We put that URL into our SSAI.” Amazon is using a similar approach, but instead of targeting SMBs, it targets its own retail platform. When you watch Amazon Prime, there are clickable ads. Instead of sending you a push notification, click­ing on that ad means you can put the advertised prod­uct directly into your Amazon cart. Amazon Prime’s clickable/shoppable ads Edge226 is the developer of Peak, an AI-powered ad tech platform. Boaz Cohen, Edge226’s chief revenue officer, describes the company’s strategy as “bring­ing new advertisers to the TV space. Traditionally, he says, the TV space is all about “brands. In the past 2, 3 years, apps and games have started advertising in the streaming services.” All of a sudden, advertising has another new revenue source. “We are bringing new adver­tisers—apps and games—to the space,” Cohen notes. “That happened because the mea­surement companies in our in­dustry—Adjust, AppsFlyer, Sin­gular, and Branch—added the ability to measure the impact of app downloads on CTV. Once that had happened, advertis­ers who are very much perfor­mance-driven started adding CTV or streaming to their ad­vertising mix.” They either pro­vide a link on mobile or have a call to action to search the app store to download their cus­tomer’s app. “We are definite­ly not buying the $40 Disney or Netflix” ad, Cohen says. “We’re looking at the $6–$10 CPM, sometimes higher, pri­marily running on FAST channels.” New ad formats have also been creeping onto the screen for a while now, e.g., the L-Wrap, which takes two sides of the screen. There is also a two-box shrink­able ad, where the content will continue to play in one screen, and then the ad will be next to it. “I think those are starting to get a lot of buzz and excitement,” says one publisher. L-Wrap advertising in live sports streams “Those do pretty well for sporting events, where they still keep viewers engaged to the screen. Viewers can see some activity in a timeout for example, but also see the ad. They’re probably less effective for binge-watching or episodic entertainment programming,” says Whale TV’s Hock. Two gotchas now: How do you sell these, and how do you measure them? “There’s usually not even an ad for­mat on a lot of these interfaces, so you obviously can’t scale if there’s no nice, automated way to do this,” Hock contends. “It’s still early to see if these formats catch on.” Whale TV is currently offering these new formats to the 300–400 TV manufacturers that use its OS. Two-box shrinkable ads “I’m most excited to lean into optimization, which is in the middle of a flight with a 3-week campaign that’s running,” says Comcast’s Babcock. “The adver­tiser should get an email that says, ‘These appear to be the three most important performance segments that we’re running against. Do you want to double down?’” That option should be available through the click of a button, she notes. “Right now, it’s somebody calling and doing a lot of work.” This seems like an ad tech problem. But realistical­ly, it’s also how business has been done since time im­memorial, so addressing this particular issue seems like a big ask. “We’ve all seen pressure from Amazon coming into the marketplace with Prime Video,” says Philo’s Bark­er. “I think we’ve seen multiple reports talking about how even the big guys like Netflix, Max, and Amazon Prime have dropped their CPMs. I think what is inter­esting about where CPMs are going from a publisher perspective is that there are a lot of people who take a tax along the way. Someone may be buying an ad for a high CPM—let’s say $50—and by the time it gets to us, we may see only half of that because the agency took a cut, the DSP took a cut, the SSP took a cut, the targeting methodology took a cut. By the time we get it, we’re seeing less.” One way Philo is working on this is by hav­ing varying pricing levels available within a programmatic buy. “We’ve just started a programmatic direct deal,” Barker says. “But we probably have 2,000 private market­place deals through our vendors running it at any one time. A lot of them will be priced differently depending on things like trans­parency. We have multiple tiers that we’re all constantly adjusting for different types of advertisers.” “There’s just a finite amount of growth that can come from subscriptions,” states CIMM’s Kee. “On the one hand, we’ll see ad-supported services continue to roll out because people want free stuff.” Regarding a lot of these new formats or approaches, she says, they need to be standardized and scalable. “If a media agency can’t put this in a media plan as a line item and run it through Mediaocean in the same way that they can run something else, then it’s not going to scale.” “2024 was the first time we saw over 50% of 18-to-49-year-olds primarily view their sports—regard­less of the league—on streaming versus linear,” says Roku’s Monahan. Adding live sports to streaming in the past few years has made the transition to stream­ing complete. “I think the dirty secret in buying is everybody’s of­fering all these amazing ways to target, whether it’s contextual or all these IDs. You can send sentiment, all these things that they’re selling,” says Philo’s Reed. “But while it looks great, if you use the Baskin-Robbins analogy, the top sellers are still going to be chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry, because people are used to that, and that’s how they do it.” Will advertising face major disruption anytime soon? I have my doubts. This is a long game. I want to cheer each and every small step that disrupts the sta­tus quo, and maybe one day, we will see a new flavor that everyone loves. But remember: It’s not enough to want to change. Can generative AI (gen AI) rip things apart and then try to glue it all back together with more insight, more intelligence, more efficiency, and more value? It really depends on what the application is. Within the video workflow, some tasks are good matches for using gen AI, and others aren't. What does the future of streaming monetization look like? This post-Peak TV media ecosystem is a brave new world, and being able to find the content you want, with the price you want to pay, will likely keep consumers on their toes for years to come. Streaming media business and monetization models expanded and diversified in 2022 and sent a clear message: Paid subscription models were a necessary gateway to widespread streaming adoption, but now ad-supported viewing has a chance to flourish.

Title: A millennial making $280,000 secretly working 2 remote jobs said it's important to get in a rhythm: 'Burnout is real'

After getting laid off four times in four years, Reed was desperate for some level of job security. So he decided to try working two full-time jobs simultaneously. In March 2020, Reed, who's in his 30s and living in New York, was laid off from his strategic operations job in the tech industry. It took him six months to start a new job, but layoffs struck again. His next job lasted less than a month because of the company's financial hardships. By December 2023, he'd lost his fourth job in just over three years. "It was easy to get the jobs because there were jobs out there, but it was hard to keep them," said Reed, whose identity was verified by Business Insider but who asked to use a pseudonym, citing a fear of professional repercussions. From 2020 to 2023, more than 800,000 tech industry employees across the globe were laid off, according to TrueUp's layoff tracker. Reed said that after the fourth layoff, he had a eureka moment. "I was like, the only way for me to combat not continuously being unemployed is to have two jobs," he said. This year, Reed is on track to earn about $280,000 secretly working two full-time remote jobs, which pay about $175,000 and $150,000 respectively. With the additional income, he said, he supports his partner — who has been unemployed for three years — helps his parents pay their monthly mortgage, and assists his niece and nephew with their college tuition. "I need these two jobs to sustain my life with my partner so we can stay in our apartment and still save money, and do all those adult things that I'm responsible for financially," he said. "I don't really have a choice." Reed is among the Americans who have secretly juggled multiple remote jobs to boost their incomes. Over the past two years, BI has interviewed more than two dozen "overemployed" workers who've used their extra earnings to travel the world, buy weight-loss drugs, or simply pay the bills. To be sure, holding multiple jobs without employer approval could have professional repercussions and lead to burnout. But many job jugglers have told BI the financial benefits have generally outweighed the downsides and risks. After his fourth layoff, Reed started applying for remote jobs, intending to accept two full-time offers if he could get them. In March 2024, he landed his first job. He said looking for another role — between all the applications and interviews — sometimes felt like a second job. In December, he finally achieved his goal and began job juggling for the first time. During his job search, Reed tried to prioritize employers that seemed committed to remote work, but this didn't always go according to plan. Around early September of last year, Reed finished the interview process for a remote position at Amazon. But soon after he'd finished interviewing, Amazon announced that many corporate employees would be required to work from the office five days a week beginning in January. When Reed received a job offer for the role, it was no longer remote: He'd be required to work full time from the nearest office, which he said was about 30 to 40 minutes away. He decided to decline the offer and, in December, accepted a remote position with another company. While other companies have also announced return-to-office policies, Reed feels confident his two current jobs will remain remote. To his knowledge, neither company has ever had a mandatory in-office policy. Reed's typical workweek is about 60 hours, he said, but he does some of his work in the evenings and on weekends. He said that while juggling two jobs could be very stressful at times, he'd found some ways to manage this stress. He gets up earlier than he needs to so he can prepare for the workday ahead, but he still makes sure to get enough sleep — he said it's easier to manage stress when he's well-rested. Additionally, rather than switching between his two work laptops every few minutes, Reed tries to focus on one job for an extended period of time before pivoting to the other. "I have to take breaks in the middle of the day to be able to decipher between one of the two jobs because it does get a little overwhelming," he said. Reed said he has an advantage that many job jugglers don't have: He generally doesn't have to worry about having two meetings scheduled at the same time. That's because he usually schedules the meetings he has to attend. He said he blocks off his meeting times for one job on the other job's calendar, which helps him reduce his chances of getting double-booked. "It has been way more manageable than I thought it was going to be," he said of job juggling. "If you can get into a rhythm of how it works and get organized with how you do the work, it's totally possible to do." Reed said that over the past couple of years, it had taken him longer to land job offers. He thinks this is because many of the remote roles he's applied for have hundreds of applicants — and the interview process has become more extensive. "I used to be able to do two, three interviews max and you would get an offer," he said. "Now it's like a hiring screen, a take-home test, a panel, you have to do a presentation — there are like six or seven steps." Looking ahead, Reed said he had no plans to stop job juggling. He doesn't think it's sustainable long-term, but with his partner still looking for work, he can't afford to stop now. "For now, I'm giving myself a three-to-five-year window," he said. "Because burnout is real. It's going to happen eventually." ​​Do you have a story to share about secretly working multiple jobs or discovering an employee is doing so?

Title: 'MBA is costliest course for teaching nothing': Consultant drops a brutal truth bomb

Feedback A senior manager at a consultancy firm, Manab Majumdar, dropped a provocative reality check about MBAs, stirring significant debate on LinkedIn: "MBA is the costliest course for teaching nothing. Yes, you can learn every subject taught in an MBA at 1/100 cost." The blunt assessment arrives amidst a rapidly shifting job market where traditional assumptions about MBA programs are being dismantled. Majumdar didn't stop there, adding, "Post MBA, you don't become the CXO of the company. Bollywood ka movie dekh k MBA wala fantasy jo hain, wo galat hain." Indeed, dreams of instant executive roles after graduation are increasingly proving unrealistic. CA Nitin Kaushik (@Finance_Bareek) on X echoed this sentiment sharply: "𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚: MBA fees ₹25,00,000, ROI: Uncertain. Research before enrolling." Even premier institutions like Harvard aren't insulated. The Wall Street Journal recently highlighted an unsettling statistic: 23% of Harvard Business School’s 2024 graduates were unemployed three months after graduation, a dramatic increase from 10% just two years earlier. Stanford and Wharton, too, have reported similar declines, with unemployment nearing 20%. Globally, the picture isn't brighter. According to the International Labour Organization, youth unemployment stood at an alarming 13% in 2023, affecting approximately 65 million young individuals worldwide. Why are MBAs struggling despite attractive median starting salaries exceeding $175,000? The answer lies partly in evolving corporate strategies. Firms like McKinsey, BCG, Google, and Amazon have sharply curtailed MBA hiring amid economic downturns and layoffs. Simultaneously, the corporate world is shifting toward smaller, specialized teams, boosted by the rise of AI and automation, making generalized MBA skills less relevant. Kristen Fitzpatrick, head of career development at Harvard Business School, starkly observes, "Going to Harvard is not going to be a differentiator." Instead, specialized technical skills are increasingly coveted. In response, business schools are pivoting rapidly. Harvard is now experimenting with AI-powered tools designed to match students to jobs and suggest tailored courses to bridge skills gaps. Copyright©2025 Living Media India Limited.

Title: Panama Port Deal Puts Hong Kong Businesses at a Crossroads
URL: https://thediplomat.com/2025/03/panama-port-deal-puts-hong-kong-businesses-at-a-crossroads/
Time Published: 2025-03-28T01:59:18Z
Full Content:
Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific Beijing’s public pressure campaign against CK Hutchison portends a growing effort by the CCP to control Hong Kong’s independent business interests. Exchange Square, which houses the offices of Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The ownership of two key ports along the Panama Canal has become a major flashpoint between the United States and China. At the heart of the showdown is the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings and its subsidiary, Hutchison Ports. Controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, CK Hutchison owns two ports at either end of the Panama Canal. U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed that the canal is “operated by China” and called for the United States to “take back” control. He has even reportedly ordered the U.S. military to explore options to secure “unfettered” access to the canal. To “de-risk” from the geopolitical contention, CK Hutchison reached a $19 billion deal to sell its expansive overseas port businesses to a consortium led by U.S. firm BlackRock in early March. While this deal might make commercial sense for the company, Beijing is reluctant to cede ownership of these ports due to their strategic value and may intervene to stop the deal. According to the Wall Street Journal, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, was enraged that CK Hutchison didn’t seek Beijing’s approval in advance, and Bloomberg has reported that Chinese regulatory agencies have been instructed to scrutinize the deal for any potential security breaches or antitrust violations. State-run Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao, commonly regarded as a Beijing mouthpiece, published a series of articles accusing the company of being “profit-seeking and unrighteous,” warning that “dancing with” U.S. politicians would lead to “the condemnation of history.” China’s government amplified that messaging when the Chinese Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office reposted the articles on its own website. This backlash reflects Beijing’s increasingly uneasy relationship with Hong Kong’s business elites. Despite the waves of securitization in recent years, the Chinese party-state still lacks formal channels of influence vis-a-vis Hong Kong businesses, and the port sale has only deepened the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s suspicion toward Hong Kong’s capitalist class. While Beijing has long co-opted local businesses to govern Hong Kong – a strategy pioneered by the British colonial government – it has become increasingly distrustful of their autonomy, profit-driven motives, and lack of patriotism. Beijing’s public pressure campaign against CK Hutchison portends a growing effort by the CCP to direct Hong Kong’s independent business interests. Is CK Hutchison part of “China, Inc.”? Due to Hong Kong’s weakening autonomy, some Western commentators increasingly view the city as indistinguishable from China. However, enterprises based in Hong Kong and mainland China still fundamentally differ in their susceptibility to Beijing’s influence. Thus, while a subsidiary of CK Hutchison Holdings has operated the ports in Balboa and Cristóbal since 1997, Trump’s claim that China controls the Panama Canal is misleading. Unlike typical participants in China’s Belt and Road Initiative or other overseas infrastructure projects, CK Hutchison is not a state-owned enterprise (SOE). It is a private company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and its institutional makeup is international. Next to the Li Ka-shing family’s 30 percent share, U.S.-based BlackRock (5 percent), the Vanguard group (2.78 percent), and the Norges Bank Investment Management (1.18 percent) are among its main institutional shareholders. Additionally, its board of directors has a notably international profile, with most members having backgrounds in Anglophone countries such as Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Operating by standard international corporate practices, CK Hutchison is more transparent and commercially driven than state-run firms that own or operate the other ports in China’s network. The company’s success story reflects a “Hong Kong” – rather than Chinese – ethos, mirroring the city’s rise as an international business hub during the colonial era. Before Li Ka-shing purchased a controlling interest in 1979, Hutchison was one of the oldest and most prominent British-owned merchant houses operating in the colony, specializing in export trade, dockyards, and shipping. Under Li’s leadership, Hutchison expanded its international footprint, becoming the world’s largest independent port operator, acquiring Husky Oil in Canada, and establishing mobile phone operations in Australia, Europe, and the United States. This trajectory contrasts with that of mainland China-based companies and SOEs, whose success is often tied to close cooperation with the CCP leadership and access to state support. CK Hutchison’s position as a Hong Kong-based company insulates it from the established toolkit used by the Chinese party-state to discipline Chinese companies. For instance, the CCP influences Chinese businesses and SOEs through the party committees embedded in each firm. Under Xi Jinping, the role of party committees has been strengthened and institutionalized, with Xi calling for the integration of party leadership in “all aspects of corporate governance.” The party committee chairman now also chairs the board of directors of SOEs, allowing the CCP to take over many aspects of the board’s functions in corporate governance. Importantly, these changes have been implemented not only in wholly or partially state-owned firms, but also in the private sector. These mechanisms allow the CCP to intervene in Chinese enterprises’ decision-making, ensuring that these enterprises align with the party’s political objectives. CK Hutchison’s governance structure does not have a party committee. As a result, Beijing lacks any direct institutional channels to influence CK Hutchison’s decision-making. While Victor Li Tzar-kuoi, the chairman of CK Hutchison and son of Li Ka-shing, has developed ties with the CCP through his position on the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the CCP’s influence over the company remains weakly institutionalized. Recent reports that China’s highest leadership has summoned Victor Li to discuss the port deal underscore the informal nature of Beijing’s pressure. Hong Kong’s de jure autonomy further complicates Beijing’s ability to pressure CK Hutchison. When China assumed sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, it promised to let the city operate with “a high degree of autonomy” and maintain its independent judicial system, meaning that Chinese national security laws do not automatically apply. Until recently, the party-state had preferred indirect means to influence Hong Kong politics, including through ad hoc legal interpretations of the Basic Law (Hong Kong’s mini-constitution), political influence via proxies like the Central Government Liaison Office, and the cultivation of strategic partnerships with Hong Kong’s business elites. Following mass protests in 2019, Beijing institutionalized its control over Hong Kong and localized its national security policies within the Hong Kong legal system by introducing legislation such as the 2020 National Security Law (NSL) and Article 23 of the Basic Law in 2024. Still, these new legal instruments are primarily aimed at dismantling Hong Kong’s civil society and political opposition rather than disciplining businesses. The government has repeatedly assured the private sector they can conduct business as usual. Among the NSL cases brought against companies, pro-democracy media outlets and organizations with significant links with prominent activists were the main targets. As Mark L. Clifford, a former board member of a media company targeted by the NSL, remarked, “It’s one thing to go after Jimmy Lai and Apple Daily, but quite another to go after ‘Superman’ KS Li and his companies, the most successful international business H.K. has ever produced.” The Challenge of Disciplining Hong Kong Capitalists Beijing’s calculus in attempting to induce or coerce CK Hutchison to collaborate with its national security agenda involves two countervailing logics. On the one hand, Beijing and Hong Kong leaders want to avoid a heavy-handed approach to restore confidence in the city’s business environment and woo foreign investment and talent. They want to convince the world that businesses will not be coerced into forgoing commercial interests in favor of national security, especially after the passage of the NSL and Article 23. The Hong Kong government has vigorously campaigned to rehabilitate Hong Kong’s image after its brutal crackdown on civil society and to dispel suggestions that Beijing controls the city. While the NSL’s prohibitions against “collusion with foreign forces” could in theory apply to CK Hutchison, pursuing such charges against a major Hong Kong conglomerate would be unprecedented and highly destabilizing. A potential intervention by Chinese regulatory agencies – along the lines suggested by Bloomberg – would further undermine Hong Kong’s legal autonomy and business confidence, as China does not have formal regulatory authorities over this “purely commercial” deal. The desire to portray Hong Kong as “open for business” explains why Chief Executive John Lee equivocated when asked whether the NSL would apply to the port sale. The fact that China’s central propaganda outlets and government offices have avoided directly condemning the deal – relying instead on fanning public opinion on social media – suggests Xi Jinping is still weighing his options. On the other hand, Beijing does not feel confident entrusting crucial maritime assets to a private Hong Kong company. Since assuming power in 2012, Xi has repeatedly expressed his ambition to “construct a strong sea power,” viewing this as vital to realizing his wider “China dream” of national rejuvenation. This entails not only the modernization of the People’s Liberation Army Navy but also heavy investments in China’s maritime industry. The U.S. Trade Representative recently accused Beijing of seeking to cultivate global trade dependence on China through strategic investments in the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. While the Chinese government has used SOEs and other proxies in these strategically significant industries to push its maritime strategy, CK Hutchison’s overseas port operation remains a notable exception to the “China, Inc.” approach. According to data collected by MERICS, among the 78 ports with Chinese or Hong Kong ownership or operations, Hutchison operates terminals in 33, outnumbering even China’s SOEs – 26 terminals are operated by China Merchants Group, 19 by COSCO, and 19 by others. The Chinese leadership is rethinking allowing a private Hong Kong company to control such a critical component of its maritime strategy, as well as its broader partnerships with Hong Kong’s business elites. To stabilize China’s indirect rule in Hong Kong and secure Hong Kong’s status as an international financial hub, Beijing has long relied on a ruling coalition formed with local elites, including the business sector. For instance, before the reform of the “patriots only” electoral system in 2021, the functional constituencies (FCs) – elected by members of corporations or registered professional bodies – had constituted half of the seats within Hong Kong’s legislative body. The FCs have served as a reliable counterbalance against democrats in the directly elected geographical constituencies by opposing any attempt to democratize Hong Kong, which they saw as a potential threat to their business interests. However, decades of partnership between Beijing and Hong Kong’s local business elite belie a degree of mutual distrust and suspicion. The Hong Kong capitalists are interested in maintaining close ties with Beijing to exploit economic opportunities in China, but some of them are also wary of China’s more assertive and interventionist approach to the economy. Beijing has been suspicious of Hong Kong businesspeople’s profit-driven motives and “lack of patriotism” as potential obstacles to its political agenda in Hong Kong. The rift between Beijing and Hong Kong business elites became visible in the 2010s. The chief executive election in 2012 was an early indication: within the Election Committee, local tycoons – including Li Ka-shing – backed Henry Tang Ying-yen, the son of a Hong Kong industrialist originating from Shanghai, while Beijing favored Leung Chun-ying, a long-time Beijing loyalist, at the last minute and got him elected. Li in particular has drawn Beijing’s suspicion for “unpatriotic” business decisions and speeches before. Since 2013, Li has gradually moved his assets out of Hong Kong and China, including relocating his flagship company from Hong Kong to the Cayman Islands and selling a major commercial complex in Shanghai in 2016. A state-affiliated Chinese think tank viewed his divestment as a betrayal, accusing him of being “ungrateful” for state support in building Hutchison’s real estate business in China and abandoning the country at the first sign of economic trouble in the 2010s. During the 2014 Umbrella Movement, Chinese state media singled out Li for not making his stance on the protests clear. At the height of the mass protests in September 2019, Li even publicly appealed to the government to show mercy to the young people. Therefore, beyond salvaging the strategic value of CK Hutchison’s port businesses, the CCP has the incentive to make an example of Li to assert its dominance over Hong Kong’s freewheeling capitalists. This is why Beijing’s mouthpieces have appealed to anti-American nationalist sentiments and ramped up the rhetorical pressure on the Li family, even though the actual strategic costs are likely less acute than the frequent invocation of “national security” by propagandists and Hong Kong’s political figures suggests. The mounting political pressure will serve as a warning signal to Hong Kong’s disloyal business elites. What’s Next? Beijing’s vociferous response to the CK Hutchison port sale has already had a chilling effect on Hong Kong’s business elites. While Hutchison’s port holdings represent a distinct strategic value for Beijing’s maritime strategy, as Xi expands the definition of national security, more sectors in Hong Kong may find themselves in a similar situation. Businesses could feel compelled to align with the political goals of the Chinese leadership, limiting their autonomy in pursuing commercial interests. Any intervention by Beijing not only validates Trump’s allegation about the strategic role of Hong Kong businesses to China, but also sets a precedent for further encroachments on Hong Kong’s private sector. Even if Beijing refrains from directly blocking the Panama ports deal, the underlying issue remains: Hong Kong’s business community still operates with a level of autonomy that Beijing increasingly finds unacceptable. Going forward, China will likely seek to reduce such autonomy, focusing on bringing strategic assets held by Hong Kong firms – including overseas ports and beyond – more directly under Beijing’s influence. The question is no longer whether Beijing will act, but how far it is willing to go.

Title: CoreWeave’s IPO priced lower than expected, at $40 per share, valuing it at $19B

UPDATED 21:34 EDT / MARCH 27 2025 by Mike Wheatley Updated Friday with market reaction: Shares of CoreWeave Inc. fell more than 5% in their stock market debut Friday morning despite the company downsizing its offer and stock price late Thursday. Investors had been closely watching CoreWeave Inc.’s initial public offering after it priced its shares at just $40, much lower than was originally anticipated. The cloud computing infrastructure company, which trades under the ticker symbol “CRWV,” raised $1.5 billion in the sale Thursday evening, making it the biggest U.S. tech issue since 2021. Its offering was seen as a bellwether for investors’ appetite for IPOs, which have been in a deep freeze for years now. CNBC reported that CoreWeave, which provides access to cloud-based graphics processing units for artificial intelligence workloads, had first targeted a price of between $47 and $55 per share. That would have valued it at around $26.5 billion based on the number of Class A and Class B shares outstanding and raised about $1 billion more. However, the offering has been reduced from 49 million shares to just 37.5 million, according to one anonymous source quoted by Bloomberg, which was the first to report the $40 price. It means CoreWeave’s valuation will be closer to $19 billion, though its market capitalization will remain higher on a fully diluted basis. According to CNBC, CoreWeave has still managed to attract some prestigious backers at that price, with Nvidia Corp. set to buy up $250 million worth of shares at the $40 price. The company had been hoping to capitalize on the rising demand for AI computing resources and the broader trend that has seen investors throw billions of dollars at AI startups. Buoyed by its close proximity to a number of AI industry leaders, CoreWeave highlighted in its IPO prospectus how its revenue had jumped seven times in the last year. But as investors looked more closely at the company’s business model, a number of concerns emerged. The company is reliant on two major customers that account for 77% of its total revenue, and it has estimated that it will need to spend billions of dollars in capital to keep up with Nvidia’s two-year GPU refresh lifecycle. A report by London’s Financial Times earlier this week dented CoreWeave’s prospects when it said that Microsoft, which provides around two-thirds of its revenue, had gone back on some of its commitments due to issues around delivery and deadlines. CoreWeave pushed back, saying the report was “false and misleading,” but it only intensified concerns some investors have that big technology companies may be overspending on AI. In the last few weeks, several analysts have noted that Microsoft appears to be scaling back on its data center investment plans. And last month, Amazon Web Services Inc., the biggest cloud infrastructure company of all, also appeared to reduce some of its near-term spending plans. Investors also noted that CoreWeave’s capital spending plans cannot be funded by its existing revenue, even after it added OpenAI as its third major customer earlier this month. It’s currently sitting on $12 billion in debt, and that’s expected to grow to about $21 billion by the end of the year. Writing in his column in The Information, the financial market analyst Cory Weinberg revealed that investors he has talked to have shared concerns regarding the proportion of CoreWeave’s revenue that’s tied to Microsoft and Nvidia. There are other alarm bells too. “They worry about CoreWeave’s founders having sold so much stock already,” Weinberg wrote. “They worry about how much cash the company expects to burn.” EquityZen analyst Phil Haslett told The Street there are also concerns about the broader macroeconomic uncertainties in the economy, plus questions about the strength of AI demand, putting the onus on CoreWeave to tell a more convincing story to investors. “It’s a unique business model that needs to find the right positioning,” Haslett said. “Hyperscalers may decide to build out their own infrastructure (like Meta Platforms), but smaller tech companies could still need a scalable solution (that CoreWeave provides).” CoreWeave’s decision to lower both its share price and the number of shares it plans to sell may be an attempt to find that positioning. But although the lower price may make its stock seem more enticing, it’s not clear if it will be low enough to convince market naysayers, and apparently there are a lot of them. In his column, Weinberg said he had read the results of a confidential survey of 135 investors from an investment bank not involved in the IPO. It revealed that 90% of respondents didn’t believe CoreWeave had a “sustainable moat,” meaning they don’t consider it a sustainable long-term investment. “One respondent summed up a broader perception about CoreWeave: ‘It’s radioactive, and I think every investor knows that,’” Weinberg wrote. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. told SiliconANGLE the concerns over CoreWeave’s overexposure to Microsoft are justified, but believes there’s still a great market opportunity for a dedicated AI cloud platform if it gets the execution right. “Without a firm commitment from Microsoft, it remains a risk, but it might still be worth a shot for some investors,” he added. CoreWeave’s debut is being watched keenly by the wider tech industry, for the IPO is seen as a major test for the market’s readiness for a new wave of stock offerings. IPOs have been few and far between since 2022, with rising interest rates and soaring inflation dampening investor enthusiasm for risky bets. The last technology company that raised more than $1 billion through an IPO was Freshworks Inc. back in 2021, and last year, both Rubrik Inc. and Reddit Inc. raised about $750 million via their offerings. In the wake of President Donald Trump’s election victory last November, many analysts said they expect to see renewed IPO activity. But the imposition of multiple tariffs has instead shocked the global economy, creating uncertainty that could dissuade investors from betting on new offerings. A number of technology firms have filed to go public later this year, including the ticketing marketplace StubHub Inc., digital health startup Hinge Health Inc., financial platform eToro Inc. and the online lender Klarna Group Plc.

Jana Small Finance Bank expands to Andhra Pradesh with first branch in Guntur, offering diverse financial services. The Indian government is becoming more dependent on household savings to handle its rising debt, with around $346 billion in sovereign bonds due over the next five years. By tapping into trusted instruments like G-Secs and small savings schemes, the government aims to reduce dependence on foreign capital and stabilize public finances. However, this strategy comes with its own risks. While short-term deposits under the (GMS) Gold Monetization Scheme will continue at the banks’ discretion, the discontinuation of new enrollments emphasizes the ongoing struggle to convince households to monetize their gold. Regardless of efforts to cut down on gold imports and boost liquidity, participation in the scheme remains low. Over-dependence on domestic savings could also restrict funds existing for private sector investments, possibly slowing long-term economic growth. With household savings on the decline and government debt on the rise, maintaining this approach may prove difficult. Striking the right balance between managing public debt and fostering private sector growth will be key to sustaining economic stability and development. Robust core markets to drive higher EBITDA — upgrade to Buy; lift TP to INR34,000 Valuation: upgrade to Buy; raise TP by 21% to INR34,000 (19% implied upside). We had turned Neutral on Shree in Jan’25 largely on account of weakness in its core markets; however, the recent recovery in core markets and higher utilization should result in market share gain for Shree, in our view. As a result, we raise our FY26F/27F volume estimates by 5%/7% to 41MT/46MT on account of its improved utilization in the Northern and Eastern regions (>80% of volume mix). Furthermore, both regions have witnessed resilient pricing, up 4% q-q, compared to only 2% pan-India. We increase our FY26F/27F EBITDA by 9%/15% to INR49bn/INR65bn from INR45bn/INR56bn, largely reflecting the company’s improved cement realizations and utilization in core markets.

Latest data suggest that the recent introduction of US tariffs has driven up manufacturing input prices and risks exacerbating supply chain frictions. This week’s flash PMI surveys from the US, Europe and Japan contained mixed evidence about the current plight of the world economy. The US economy maintained some decent momentum in March at the same time as Europe’s growth rate has picked up pace. Japan in contrast saw some marked weakening in its headline composite PMI, suggesting a big loss of momentum. As above chart suggests US factories reported the steepest rise in input costs for 31 months, causing the rate of inflation to far outpace equivalent rates reported in the other G4 economies. Despite these challenges, US corporate profits surged to a record high in the fourth quarter, driven by strong demand and pricing power. Profits from current production, with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rose by $204.7 billion, or 5.4%, reaching an all-time high of $4 trillion. . On the macroeconomic front, the US GDP growth rate has slowed, coming in at 2.4%—slightly above the forecasted 2.3% but significantly lower than the previous 3.1%. Meanwhile, the goods trade deficit narrowed by 4.9% to $147.9 billion in February, as exports rose by $7 billion to $178.6 billion, while imports dipped by $0.6 billion to $326.5 billion. In Asia, Taiwan is exploring multiple options to respond to potential new US tariffs.

Mehta Equities Market kya lagta hain@ 7.30am – Friday, March 28th 2025 US President Donald Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on imported cars and auto parts, a move aimed at boosting domestic automotive manufacturing by incentivizing automakers to invest in the United States. The tariff, effective from April 3, is expected to generate approximately $100 billion annually for the US economy, marking a significant shift in US trade policy. The policy affects not only fully assembled vehicles but also key automotive components such as engines, transmissions, powertrain systems, and electrical assemblies. This decision is likely to disrupt global supply chains, with significant repercussions for India’s auto parts industry, which supplies major US and global automakers. Indian automotive component manufacturers, many of whom are integral to the global supply chain, now face potential cost escalations and trade uncertainties. The increased tariffs could reduce exports to the US, forcing Indian companies to explore alternative markets or establish local manufacturing units within the United States to bypass the tariffs. This policy shift aligns with Trump’s broader “America First” economic agenda, prioritizing domestic production over foreign imports. However, it also raises concerns about rising vehicle prices in the US, potential trade tensions with major auto-exporting nations, and the long-term impact on global automotive investments.

Geopolitical tensions, trade policy uncertainties, volatility in international commodity prices and financial market uncertainties pose considerable risks to India’s economic growth in the next fiscal, however the outlook for inflation remains benign, Ministry of Finance said on March 26. In its Monthly Economic Review for February 2025, the ministry highlighted, “domestic private sector capital formation, focused on India’s solid fundamentals and economic prospects, will be an important driver of economic growth in FY26.” The review pointed out that supportive fiscal measures, accommodative monetary policy, and the Union Budget’s focus on longer-term development reforms will strengthen India’s domestic economic resilience amidst significant global uncertainties. India’s economy is expected to grow between 6.3 and 6.8 percent in FY26. On the inflation front, the finance ministry expects food prices to remain benign given estimates of agricultural production. Retail inflation eased to 3.6 percent in February 2025 as food prices eased. The monthly economic review noted that India’s economic performance in the latter half of FY25 was supported by strong agricultural and service sector growth, alongside steady private consumption. The report highlighted that “real GDP and real GVA are estimated to have grown by 6.2 per cent in Q3 FY25. This reflected a rebound in economic activity from Q2 FY25, in which GDP growth was 5.6 per cent.” Growth in the agricultural sector was particularly strong at 4.6 percent in FY25, driven by robust kharif output and positive rabi prospects. India’s fiscal management also remains on track, with the Union Budget 2025-26 laying out a prudent fiscal consolidation path. “The Union Budget 2025-26 announced a cautiously ambitious debt consolidation path that projects union government debt to decline by at least 5.1 percentage points over a six-year period from 2024-25 to 2030-31.” The government maintained a balance between fiscal consolidation, welfare, and growth, ensuring that “there is a close convergence of actual deficits, critical ratios, and essential expenditures with their budget estimates, indicating a sustained commitment to fiscal targets.” Meanwhile, trade performance showed mixed trends. While India’s total exports increased by 6.2 percent year-on-year during April-February FY25, merchandise exports recorded only marginal growth of 0.1 percent, weighed down by weaker petroleum product exports. However, services exports remained resilient, contributing to an overall trade surplus. “India’s exports have recorded softer growth thus far in FY25. However, a robust services trade surplus continues to offset the impact of lower growth in merchandise exports.” Foreign investments saw a decline in net FDI due to increased repatriation and outbound investments. Nonetheless, the finance ministry remains optimistic about India’s capital market resilience, supported by steady fiscal management and policy reforms. “Despite the sell-off by FPIs and heightened global market turbulence, the Rupee continues to be amongst the least volatile currencies as compared to its peers.” India’s inclusion in the Bloomberg Emerging Market Local Currency Index is expected to further bolster foreign investment in debt markets. Labour market indicators reflected stability, with the urban unemployment rate declining to 6.4 percent in Q3 FY25, accompanied by improvements in labour force participation and workforce expansion. Payroll data from EPFO indicated a net addition of 17.89 lakh members in January 2025, reflecting a continued increase in formal sector employment. The report stated that “various indices and surveys reveal positive sentiments towards hiring.” Despite global uncertainties, the finance ministry reiterated that “strong macroeconomic fundamentals, sustained investment, and policy support would help India navigate external risks while maintaining a steady growth trajectory in the upcoming fiscal year.” HCL Tech: Company partners with Samsung to enhance Semiconductor innovation.

Title: JPMorgan Just Beat Big Tech to a Quantum Breakthrough

Pulling numbered balls out of a mixing machine. Tracking the twitch of a mouse cursor. Converting lava lamp motion into data. These are just a few ways real-world randomness is generated—essential for things like lotteries and Internet encryption, where unpredictability equals security. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Transmitting that randomness over the Internet, however, is a different story. Physically random processes are hard to verify remotely, and by design, traditional computers can’t generate true randomness. But a new quantum breakthrough may have solved the problem. Published yesterday (May 26) in Nature, a study from JPMorgan Chase researchers—alongside collaborators at Argonne and Oak Ridge national labs and the University of Texas at Austin—demonstrates how a quantum computer generates “certified” randomness. Quantum computers don’t use ordinary bits but qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once and collapse into intrinsically random outcomes. Using a 56-qubit quantum computer from Quantinuum, the researchers produced random numbers that were then verified by classic supercomputers. “It’s the first experimental demonstration of the use of a quantum computer to generate certified random numbers,” said Scott Aaronson, the UT Austin professor who introduced the randomness protocol used in the study, in an interview with Observer. Quantum computing has attracted increasing attention from tech and financial firms, which hope to use it to solve problems today’s supercomputers cannot. JPMorgan’s Marco Pistoia, head of global tech applied research, called the result a major milestone—not just for quantum hardware but also for fields like statistical sampling, simulation and cryptography. Even so, certified randomness won’t be hitting your phone tomorrow. Aaronson noted that verifying the results is still costly. “I don’t expect this to be an application that changes the world,” he said. “But it is one of the first uses of a quantum computer for anything that I couldn’t say for certain is useless.” JPMorgan isn’t alone in chasing quantum breakthroughs, which, by some estimates, could grow by $2 trillion in the next 15 years. In early 2025, Google (GOOGL) unveiled Willow, a quantum chip that completes in five minutes a benchmark task that would take today’s best supercomputers 10 septillion years. In February, Microsoft (MSFT) created its Majorana 1 chip using a rare new state of matter known as a “topological state.” Even Nvidia (NVDA)’s Jensen Huang—who once tanked quantum stocks by questioning the field’s relevance—has softened his stance. Earlier this month, the chipmaking executive walked back his critique while announcing a new Nvidia-backed quantum research facility in Boston.

March 27, 2025 19:52 ET | Source: Portnoy Law Portnoy Law Investors can contact the law firm at no cost to learn more about recovering their losses LOS ANGELES, March 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Portnoy Law Firm advises Merck & Co., Inc. ("Merck" or the "Company") (NYSE: MRK) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). Merck investors have until April 14, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: lesley@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. According to the complaint, the defendants provided investors with material information regarding Merck’s projected $11 billion in revenue from Gardasil sales by 2030. Their statements expressed confidence in Merck’s ability to drive demand through consumer activation and education efforts, emphasizing the benefits of Gardasil and targeting eligible populations for vaccination. As a result, they issued optimistic reports and forecasts about Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced that it would no longer meet its long-forecasted $11 billion in Gardasil sales by 2030. The company revealed it would halt shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants attributed this decision to an overinflation of channel inventories, citing that demand in China had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this announcement, Merck’s common stock plummeted. After closing at $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, the stock price dropped to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025—a decline of more than 9% in just one day.

Title: Wegovy sales took a hit this year. Novo's CEO blames off-brand competition
URL: https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-wegovy-compunded-semaglutide-ceo-1851772858
Time Published: 2025-03-27T21:04:00Z
Full Content:
Sales of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+1.81%) blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy took a hit due to rising competition from off-brand, or compounded, versions of the treatment, according to the Danish pharma giant’s CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen. The growing popularity of compounded semaglutide — a copycat version of the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — was top of mind for both the company’s executives and shareholders at an annual meeting. Still, Jørgensen touted that the company’s weight-loss drug sales rose 57% last year. “We are currently treating around 1.2 million obese patients in the U.S., while 55 million people have insurance coverage for Wegovy,” said Jørgensen. “We continue to focus on scaling, supply, commercial execution, and combating compounding.” Compounding refers to the custom preparation of an otherwise branded drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Drugs can also be compounded under other conditions, including when a patented medication is in short supply. But with Novo Nordisk ramping up production and Wegovy no longer on the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) shortage list, the pharma giant claims that most compounded versions are no longer justified. The FDA has also said it could start citing companies and healthcare providers that continue to offer certain versions of compounded semaglutide starting as early as May 22. Novo Nordisk lists Wegovy at $1,349.02 per month, and drug-shortage rules allowed compounders to sell versions of the drug at lower prices. Jørgensen acknowledged that the “significant growth of compounding in the U.S.” appears to have affected Wegovy prescriptions in early 2025. For instance, the millennial-targeted telehealth company Hims & Hers started offering compounded semaglutide last May. The company’s total sales grew 69% last year to $1.5 billion. One shareholder asked how long it would take for the trend to reverse, citing rumors that compounded drugs could account for as much as 40% of the U.S. obesity treatment market. Jørgensen did not provide a specific timeline but outlined the company’s multi-pronged strategy to combat competition from compounders. Novo Nordisk says it’s deploying a mix of legal action, physician outreach, and pricing incentives. The company has sued multiple compounders, launched an ad campaign to warn doctors and patients about the risks of non-FDA-approved versions, and introduced a new cash-only option offering Wegovy for $499 per month.

Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff.

Stocks’ losses eased after data showed the labor market holding up and fourth-quarter economic growth was revised higher. The good news helped temper the impact of Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on cars, trucks and auto parts — which sent General Motors (GM+0.58%) and some peers down. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuated after fourth-quarter GDP growth was revised up 2.4% annually from 2.3%, reflecting higher investment and a downward revision to import growth. New filings for jobless benefits remained steady in the week to March 22, as did continuing claims for the priror week. “Hard to see recession in these data, but the real test will be the initial read on Q1 2025 GDP, when the trade shocks feed into the numbers — that may not look so rosy,” Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, said in an email. “The labor market is far stronger and resilient than folks appreciate.” Automakers weren’t a big beneficiary of the batter data, as they face higher costs under Trump’s tariffs that they’ll either have to absorb or pass on to customers. JPMorgan (JPM+0.78%) downgraded its price targets for GM, Ford (F+3.38%) and Ferrari (RACE-0.16%). GM stock plunged 6.5%, Ford declined 2%, and Stellantis (STLA-0.84%) fell 1.5%. The U.S.-traded shares of some foreign automakers slid, with Toyota (TM-1.24%) and Honda (HMC-0.46%) both falling more than 2%. Ferrari reversed an earlier decline after saying it’ll raise American prices for its cars by up to 10% after the tariffs go into effect April 2. Tesla (TSLA-2.08%), one of the automakers least affected by the tariffs, rebounded from initial lows to trade more than 3% higher. Elon Musk said the electric vehicle makers, which relies on some imported parts, will take a hit from the tariffs. Nvidia (NVDA-1.87%) stock slid about 1.2% after dropping 5.7% yesterday. Beijing has asked firms in China to use energy-efficient chips in data centers, the Financial Times reported on March 25. GameStop (GME+2.58%) plunged 25%, more than surrendering its gain yesterday after it announced plans to raise $1.3 billion by selling convertible senior notes due 2030 to finance Bitcoin investments. Jefferies (JEF+2.33%) stock plunged more than 9% after the investment bank’s quarterly earnings missed expectations, with revenue 14.5% below the StreetAccount consensus forecast and earnings per share 39% lower. Concentrix (CNXC-1.79%) stock jumped 37% after the outsourcing company’s quarterly per-share profit of $2.79 exceeded expectations by about 8.1%, and CEO Chris Caldwell used the earnings call to express confidence in the firms AI strategy. —With reporting by William Gavin Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Why May 15 is a key date to watch for Nvidia stock

Nvidia investors have a key catalyst on the horizon, according to Bank of America. Strategists at the bank are watching May 15, the day the US government will roll out the so-called AI Diffusion Rule, a regulatory framework that aims to control foreign countries' access to high-tech chips from the US. The rules would impose restrictions on some sales of Nvidia's chips and potentially narrow its market, but the event could actually end up being positive for Nvidia stock. That's because the company could recover from its recent slump once wider geopolitical concerns are "sized and priced," the bank said on Thursday. "There is a wide range of outcomes, and NVDA stock could stay volatile till the May-15 date, aka 'Liberation Day' as a catalyst when the impact could be reflected in the stock," strategists said. There are several other catalysts that could boost Nvidia stock, the bank said. Strategists pointed to a potential recovery in GM, which announced a partnership with Nvidia earlier this month, as well as Nvidia's new Blackwell Ultra chip. In its most recent earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang said demand for Nvidia's existing Blackwell chip was "extraordinary." "Meanwhile, we believe the stock is providing a particularly attractive opportunity for one of the most unique, high-quality tech franchises leading the largest and fastest growing secular trends," the bank said. Bank of America reiterated its "Buy" rating on the chipmaker and issued a price target of $200 a share, implying 75% upside from current levels. The stock was trading around $113 on Thursday morning and is down 18% year-to-date. After back-to-back years of stellar growth, Nvidia stock has lost momentum this year thanks to budding concerns about US AI dominance, as well as jitters related to tariffs and the outlook for the economy. Earlier this month, investors had their eyes set on Nvidia's GPU Tech Conference, dubbed the "Super Bowl of AI," where Huang gave key updates on the firm's new projects and what it sees for the path ahead. Shares have sagged this week on news that Nvidia is at risk of losing business in China, thanks to new energy-efficiency rules that would bar sales of some chips. The stock fell as much as 5% Wednesday morning and edged lower another 1% on Thursday. Jump to

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares lost ground Thursday as Jefferies analysts downgraded the stock, saying they expect the performance gap between AMD's latest products and Nvidia's (NVDA) to widen. The analysts downgraded AMD's stock to a "hold" and cut their price target to $120, down from a "buy" rating and $135 price target previously. That's well below the $139 average target of analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, five of whom have issued "hold" ratings, compared to seven "buy" and one "sell" rating. AMD shares were down close to 4% near $106 in recent trading Thursday, and have lost more than 40% of their value over the last 12 months. Citing performance tests conducted with three open-source artificial intelligence (AI) models in recent weeks, Jefferies wrote that Nvidia's H200 graphics processing unit (GPU) still has a "significant performance advantage" over AMD's MI300x, and that they expect the gap could "expand further" with Nvidia's Rubin and Blackwell lines. Nvidia's GPU "outperformed AMD by a wide margin" across most of the analysts' tests. Despite AMD's product having some advertised advantages like higher memory bandwidth, they "do not result in superior real-world performance," the analysts wrote. They also said "expectations of mounting competition" from Intel (INTC) contributed to the downgrade, as they believe Intel could have "fairly competitive chips" by next year under its new CEO.

Title: Ferrari's luxury cars are about to get more expensive, thanks to Trump's tariffs

American buyers of Ferrari’s (RACE-0.16%) luxury vehicles will soon have to pay higher prices, as the Italian automaker looks to offset the burden of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The Trump administration’s new 25% tariffs on all imports of finished cars and trucks and of auto parts are set to go into effect on April 3. Almost half of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are imported, as are almost 60% of all parts in vehicles assembled in the U.S. Ferrari said Thursday that the impact of the tariffs would be partially reflected in its pricing for almost all imports after April 2. Excluding imports of Ferrari 297, SF90, and Roma vehicles, new cars could become as much as 10% more expensive. Some 40% of Ferrari’s global sales come from the U.S. market. “And while Ferrari demand may prove amongst the least elastic to moderate changes in price...Ferrari purchases are arguably amongst the most discretionary also, and so we could envision some buyers electing to delay taking delivery,” JPMorgan (JPM+0.78%) analysts led by Ryan Brinkman said in a Thursday note. Analysts at Bernstein (AB-0.10%) led by Stephen Reitman argued in a Thursday note that U.S. customers won’t be pushed away by higher prices. Ferrari’s customers tend to be wealthier individuals who will be less impacted by tariffs, which put more pressure on poorer consumers. “We are hard-pressed to think of any customer cohort in the U.S. that is better placed than Ferrari’s to absorb higher prices,” the Bernstein analysts said. “Any increase in new prices will be somewhat cushioned by the knowledge that the customer’s other Ferraris in their garage have seen their values rise.” JPMorgan lowered its December 2025 price target for Ferrari by 12%, to $460 per share from $525 per share, while Bernstein maintained an outperform rating on the stock. Ferrari stock is up by almost 2% and trades at $421 per share. Ferrari said its financial targets for 2025 will remain unchanged. The company has forecast adjusted earnings of at least 2.68 billion euros ($2.88 billion), an increase of at least 5%, and net revenue of more than 7 billion euros ($7.5 billion) for the full year. Ferrari recorded net profit of 1.53 billion euros ($1.6 billion) and revenue of 6.7 billion euros ($7.2 billion) in 2024. That’s an increase of 21% and 12%, respectively, compared to 2023.

Title: Here are the chips that Nvidia can sell to China

After the U.S. placed chip-export controls on China in October 2022 to curb the country’s technological advances, U.S.-based chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) designed less-powerful versions of its artificial intelligence chips to continue its presence in the Chinese market while complying with the rules. Nvidia’s most advanced A100 and H100 chips were blocked under the restrictions, leading it to develop the reduced-capability A800 and H800 chips. Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used the H800s to train and develop its AI models that rattled Silicon Valley and Wall Street earlier this year. However, under updated chip-export controls introduced in October 2023, those graphics processing units, or GPUs, were also banned, prompting the company to develop three more compliant chips. Now, concerns are mounting over whether Nvidia will be able to sell these specially-designed chips for much longer, as trade tensions between the U.S. and China rise. China and Hong Kong are the chipmaker’s fourth-largest market, representing about 13% of its annual revenue — or $17.1 billion — for fiscal year 2025, according to Nvidia’s Form 10-K. Earlier this week, the Trump administration announced new U.S. trade restrictions against dozens of Chinese tech firms, citing national security and foreign policy concerns — a continuation of the years long effort to maintain the U.S. lead in chips and AI. Here are three chips Nvidia can sell to China. To comply with the updated chip-export controls, Nvidia developed the H20, which is a modified version of its more powerful H100 GPUs that are used by major firms such as Google (GOOGL) and Meta (META). The H20 has become its most prominent chip in the Chinese market. The H20 has a reduced core count making it lower performing but still able to deliver AI capabilities. This week, H3C — one of China’s largest server makers — warned that the country could face potential shortages of the H20, as demand has grown significantly since DeepSeek’s boom. The L20 is based on Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace architecture, and was built on the 5 nanometer process. The L20 is a modified version of the AD102 — Nvidia’s flagship GPU. The AD102 can support gaming and AI. The L2 is based on the Ada Lovelace architecture, and is a modified version of the AD104 GPU.

As many as 17 staff members will be let go as part of the layoffs. The studio, currently working on the next Tomb Raider title, said the job cuts would not affect its plans for its current projects. In addition to the action-adventure franchise, Crystal Dynamics is also co-developing the Perfect Dark reboot for Xbox. “This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members,” the studio said in a statement on Thursday. “We did not make this decision lightly. Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected.” The studio said it would support affected employees with transition packages and opportunity outreach. “Crystal Dynamics remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games. This change does not alter our current project plans,” it added. This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members.

This year, Warner Bros. announced it was shutting down three of its studios and cancelling a AAA game. Studios like NetEase, Striking Distance Studios, Crytek, BioWare, among others, have been hit with layoffs in 2025, as well. Crystal Dynamics has been working on the next Tomb Raider game, which is set to be published by Amazon Games. The studio had been “fairly sheltered” from the turmoil at its parent company, Embracer Group, Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann had said in August last year. Embracer bought Crystal Dynamics from Square Enix in 2022, but the Swedish conglomerate fell in debt after a $2 billion (roughly Rs. 16,783 crore) investment deal with Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games Group collapsed, sparking a share price drop, mass layoffs at the company and its many subsidiaries, studio closures, cancellation of multiple in-development projects and eventual sale of several studios within its portfolio. Embracer sold Gearbox to Take-Two, divested Saber Interactive, but held on to Crystal Dynamics and the Tomb Raider IP. Crystal Dynamics has not shared details about the next Tomb Raider, but the game is in the early stages of development. The untitled Tomb Raider title, however, is confirmed to be a single-player, narrative-driven adventure that continues Lara Croft's story in the series.

More addresses the audience during the second day of the Web Summit 2024 in Lisbon. Web Summit is an annual technology conference featuring high profile individuals. The event was founded in 2009 by Irish entrepreneur Paddy Cosgrave, alongside David Kelly, and Daire Hickey, Web Summit was originally held in Dublin, Ireland. It moved to Lisbon in 2016. (Photo by Bruno de Carvalho/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) By my count, there have been zero initial public offerings related to generative artificial intelligence. That’s compared to 2,888 IPOs during the dot-com era, according to International Banker. That could change March 28 when shares of AI cloud hosting firm CoreWeave begin trading, according to the Wall Street Journal. The offering size was cut on March 27 to $1.5 billion—“selling 37.5 million shares below the range at $40 apiece,” Reuters reported. This was below the $2.7 billion some investors initially hoped for, added Reuters. When you place yourself between a big buyer and a big seller you are at a high risk of getting squeezed by both. With Microsoft as a big customer and Nvidia as its AI chip supplier, that is where CoreWeave sits in the industry. Therefore, while CoreWeave’s investment bankers will try to engineer a big first-day pop, I think investors may be better off resisting the urge to buy the stock. That’s because CoreWeave is: In addition, questions remain about whether Michael Intrator—who managed hedge funds before taking over CoreWeave in 2017 and lacks public company CEO experience—can deliver expectations-beating financial results and raise guidance each quarter. While extremely rapid growth in demand for Nvidia chips could keep CoreWeave ahead of those expectations, investors seem to have concluded the AI chip designer’s triple-digit revenue growth is behind it. I have requested comment from CoreWeave and will update this post if I receive a reply. Livingston, New Jersey-based CoreWeave was started in 2017 to mine crypto and has since evolved into a provider of AI cloud computing services. CoreWeave was an early buyer of Nvidia GPUs for data centers before they became popular for running AI applications, reported Bloomberg. In 2024, the company’s 2024 revenue grew about 730% to $1.9 billion while its net loss increased 45% to $863 million, noted Bloomberg. CoreWeave has signed “two sizable deals ahead of its listing”—including a pact to deliver up to $11.9 billion in AI infrastructure to OpenAI in exchange for which the startup will receive $350 million worth of CoreWeave stock, Bloomberg wrote. The company also had $15.1 billion in “remaining performance obligations” at the end of 2024 and has said a “little over half of that will be recognized as revenue by the end of 2026,” the Journal reported. CoreWeave is in a fierce competition to buy Nvidia chips. Indeed, much wealthier companies—Microsoft (which accounted for 62% of CoreWeave’s 2024 revenue), Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet—are increasing capital expenditures by 39% in 2025 to more than $340 billion, the Journal wrote. Intrator will enjoy significant voting control over CoreWeave. He is expected to hold about 2% of the company’s Class A shares and “almost half the company’s Class B shares after the deal, giving him 37% of the shareholder voting power,” according the IPO prospectus. None of CoreWeave’s founders plan to sell stock in the IPO. Investors must consider whether CoreWeave will be able to manage major risks to its business. The most significant of these include the company’s high dependence on a few customers, a large inventory of an older generation of AI chips for rent, and high cash burn rate and rising debt. A substantial portion of CoreWeave’s revenue comes from a small number of large customers. A big risk facing the company—and hence investors—is “the loss of, or a significant reduction in, spend from one or a few of our top customers would” which would damage the company’s “business, operating results, financial condition, and future prospects,” noted CoreWeave’s IPO prospectus. How so? About 77% of CoreWeave’s revenue came from its top two customers in 2024, one of which was Microsoft, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of overall sales, according to the prospectus. A basic truth of the semiconductor industry is chips become obsolete rapidly. This is certainly true of the AI chip segment—in which Nvidia keeps cannibalizing its biggest selling by developing new ones that are faster and more powerful, according to my book “Brain Rush: How to Invest and Compete in the Real World of Generative AI.” CoreWeave—which rents hourly access to Nvidia graphics processing units so developers can build more advanced AI models, according to CNBC—holds a huge inventory of Nvidia’s slower chips. Most of CoreWeave’s AI chips – some 250,000 H-100 Hopper chips, noted CNBC—were in-demand a few years ago but not so much now. The Hopper chips were state of the art and scarce in 2023 and 2024 as AI companies scrambled to buy them when ChatGPT was rapidly gaining users in 2023, CNBC reported. Now, Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs – which started shipping late last year—are blowing Hopper chips out of the water. Hopper chips are “fine” for some circumstances but "not many," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang joked at Nvidia’s GTC conference last week, CNBC wrote. The risk to CoreWeave? As new chips come out, the value to developers and hence the rate the company can charge to rent its Hopper chips will drop. That price drop could threaten CoreWeave’s top line—especially with Blackwell systems in full production. When Nvidia launches an upgraded version of Blackwell in late 2026, the price of Hopper chips will go down, as will the price of renting them, Huang said. CoreWeave’s rental rates have plunged and are likely to keep dropping. H100s rented at $8 per hour in 2023—which has since plunged more than 66% to below $2/hour, noted CNBC. To compete with Blackwell on price per output, CoreWeave would need to slash its rental rate to 65% below what customers pay for the Blackwell. More specifically, CoreWeave would need to charge 98 cents per hour to match the $2.20 per hour per GPU for a Blackwell rack system, analyst firm SemiAnalysis told CNBC. CoreWeave may keep struggling to provide developers with state-of-the-art chips at competitive prices. As it strains against too much old inventory, the company may write off the value of its older chips faster than expected—which would cut into earnings, noted Barclays analyst Ross Sandler in a March 21 report featured by CNBC. CoreWeave says change to its “significant” assumptions about the useful lifetime of its AI infrastructure, could hurt its business or future prospects, noted the company’s prospectus. CoreWeave is not adding enough value to the chips it buys from Nvidia to charge a high enough price to generate positive cash flow. Meanwhile, the company is borrowing heavily— collateralized by Nvidia chips, noted the Journal. To satisfy its revenue growth, CoreWeave’s cash burn rate soared nearly six-fold to about $6 billion in 2024 “because of the heavy capital expenditures to build out its AI infrastructure,” the Journal wrote. So, it comes as little surprise CoreWeave had trouble complying with the terms of a $7.6 billion loan from Blackstone. The good news is CoreWeave “did not miss any payments under the loan facility,” according to the Financial Times. The bad news is CoreWeave “made a slew of serious administrative errors, which stemmed from beginning to use the financing to expand into western Europe,” noted The Financial Times, which was prohibited by loan contract terms restricting the debt’s collateral to the U.S. This highlights another risk of concern to investors—“material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting,” noted the IPO prospectus. The default incident cast a “horrific” light on CoreWeave’s internal controls given how “obvious” the restrictions were, a hedge fund manager told The Financial Times. Weak internal controls are particularly troubling for a company so heavily dependent on debt. By the end of 2024, CoreWeave had raised $12.9 billion of debt and had drawn about $8 billion from the facilities, according to its latest financial report. The cash outflows to meet repayment obligations are significant. The company must make “nearly $7.5bn in debt and interest payments by the end of next year,” reported The Financial Times. Neither Blackstone nor CoreWeave commented on The Financial Times report. To profit from investing in CoreWeave, investors will need many things to go their way. The stock will likely rise only if the company can beat and raise in future quarters. Moreover, CoreWeave lacks the capital those larger rivals can deploy and will not get enough from the IPO to close the distance—especially since the company has said $1 billion is earmarked to pay down debt, noted the Journal. The success of CoreWeave also depends on whether demand for AI continues to grow very rapidly. “We believe this structure may continue to work as long as demand for AI continues to grow exponentially,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria wrote in a March 24 report where he set a neutral rating on CoreWeave’s shares, according to the Journal. With Nvidia stock down 10% so far this year and the company’s growth rate slowing down as I wrote in a February Forbes post, it remains unclear how CoreWeave can sustain fast enough growth to exceed the high expectations embedded in its post-IPO stock price.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. We warned in early March that CoreWeave's IPO, one of the most anticipated public flotation events of the year, faced a growing chorus of headwinds, including moderating GPU prices, data center excess capacity risks courtesy of Microsoft's recent retrenchment in this space, and sustainability concerns around CoreWeave's revenue trajectory. Well, all of these factors are now coming to a head just as the company is about to go public. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, CoreWeave is a cloud company that specializes in handling GPU-intensive AI workloads. Over the past few years, the company has carved out for itself a winning niche: it has created a unique partnership with NVIDIA to be among the first to offer access to NVIDIA's latest-gen GPUs at scale, all packaged within an infrastructure that has been optimized to handle AI workloads, replete with "sub-microsecond" network latency and an effective GPU lifecycle management system. Basically, CoreWeave rents out NVIDIA's latest GPUs, packaged with various bells and whistles designed to attract AI startups. This brings us to the crux of the matter. Originally, CoreWeave planned to raise at least $4 billion via an IPO that would value the company at $35 billion. Scoop: CoreWeave is planning to downsize its IPO and cut the price — I'm hearing closer to the $23B valuation it had in the private market a year ago than the ~$30B it wanted. — Liz Hoffman (@lizrhoffman) March 27, 2025 However, in what amounted to an inauspicious start to CoreWeave's IPO day, Semafor reported earlier today that the company was now targeting a $23 billion valuation. *COREWEAVE IS SAID PLANNING TO CUT IPO SIZE TO ABOUT $1.5B Was supposed to be $3BN. Couldn't fill half the orderbook. This is very bad for revenue roundtripping schemes https://t.co/adSrC6vqjy — zerohedge (@zerohedge) March 27, 2025 Then, reports emerged that CoreWeave could not manage to fill even half of its orderbook and that the company would now raise just $1.5 billion in its IPO instead of its targeted cash raise of $4 billion. This IPO is a total disaster: NVDA forced to step in and "anchor" the IPO with a $250MM order at $40 per CNBC Without NVDA, which already owns 5% of CRWV, IPO would bust https://t.co/GS9rPpneGb — zerohedge (@zerohedge) March 27, 2025 Next, CNBC is now reporting that the prevailing situation has compelled NVIDIA to step in with a $250 million investment to anchor CoreWeave's IPO at $40 per share. Of course, TD Cowen's latest note is likely to have played a role in souring the sentiment around CoreWeave's IPO. As a refresher, TD Cowen analyst Michael Elias recently leveraged his channel checks to note that Microsoft's data center lease cancelations are "more pervasive" than previously thought, prompting investors to question the sustainability of the ongoing AI-related CapEx. Specifically, Elias calculated that Microsoft appears to have walked away - via lease deferrals and outright cancelations - from over 2GW of data center capacity in the US and the EU over the past six months. While Elias concedes that Microsoft's decision not to support OpenAI's training workloads might have partially prompted this retrenchment, he goes on to declare that the prevailing paradigm "points to data center oversupply relative to its current demand forecast." Of course, do note that Google and Meta have stepped forward to reclaim some of Microsoft's recently freed data center capacity. Bear in mind that Microsoft was responsible for 62 percent of CoreWeave's revenue in 2024. And, the tech giant previously intended to spend over $10 billion on CoreWeave's services by 2030. Elsewhere, concerns continue to linger around CoreWeave's revenue and cash burn trajectory. The company burned $1.1 billion in cash in 2023, and a whopping $6 billion in 2024, courtesy of its gigantic CapEx to build out AI infrastructure. As of the end of 2024, CoreWeave housed over 250,000 GPUs from NVIDIA across its 32 data centers, with the Hopper architecture constituting the vast majority of these GPUs. Due to its relentless cash needs, CoreWeave has raised $14.5 billion in financing via 12 funding rounds. It currently has a debt load of around $11 billion. Critically, most of CoreWeave's debt stock is secured against its gigantic stash of NVIDIA GPUs. However, with an hour of GPU compute trading at just $2 at the end of 2024 vs. the $8 per hour price tag earlier in the year, some remain concerned about the health of CoreWeave's GPU collateral. CoreWeave does have one thing going for it: consider the fact that its 2024 revenue increased by 737 percent year-over-year to $1.92 billion from just $229 million in revenue that it recorded in 2023. Nonetheless, the company has yet to show a profit, having reported a net loss of $863 million in 2024, and $594 million in 2023. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Almost two years ago, the studio made similar reassurances about Tomb Raider and Perfect Dark not being disrupted after the massive Embracer Group layoffs and developer closures in 2023. Just over a year ago, Lara Croft's new "unified" design was shown off for the heroine's next game, which will be published by Amazon. There is also a Prime Video TV series in the works for Tomb Raider, but it won't be connected to the game. Crystal Dynamics is also co-developing Perfect Dark with The Initiative for Xbox Game Studios. The game starring Joanna Dark got its first gameplay trailer last summer, but it still doesn't have a release window. Most recently, Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered came out on PC and consoles last month. Crystal Dynamics worked with Aspyr on the remastered bundle. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Crystal Dynamics, the studio known for its share of modern Tomb Raider titles, is the latest video game developer to get hit by layoffs. The company revealed today that 17 members from its team have been let go to "better align" with its business requirements. The announcement arrived via a social media post. "This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members," said the company. "We did not make this decision lightly." As its primary internal project, the company is said to be building its next-generation Tomb Raider experience. Lara Croft is set to return in an Amazon Games-published title. While not many details have been revealed yet, the game will be single-player, focusing on a fresh storyline that continues from Crystal Dynamics' previous Tomb Raider 'Survivor Trilogy'. It's being developed using Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5. "We did not make this decision lightly. Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio’s future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected," Crystal Dynamics added regarding today's layoffs. "We recognize how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach." Alongside the next Tomb Raider, Crystal Dynamics is also a co-developer of Perfect Dark, the upcoming single-player spy-thriller experience comes from Xbox's first-party studio, The Initiative.

Title: JPMorgan drops its price target for Ford, GM, and Ferrari as Trump's 'draconian' tariffs loom

General Motors’ (GM+0.58%), Ford Motor’s (F+3.38%), and Ferrari’s (RACE-0.16%) earnings are likelier than ever to take a hit, as President Donald Trump’s “draconian” tariffs and anti-electric vehicle policies hang over the automakers, according to JPMorgan (JPM+0.78%) analysts. The Trump administration’s new 25% tariffs on all imports of parts and finished cars and trucks are set to go into effect on April 3. Almost half of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are imported, as are almost 60% of all parts in vehicles assembled in the U.S. “Anybody who has plants in the United States, it’s going to be good for,” Trump said Wednesday of his tariffs. JPMorgan analysts led by Ryan Brinkman lowered their December price target for GM to $53 per share from $64 per share, for Ford to $11 per share from $13 per share, and for Ferrari to $460 per share from $525 per share, according to a Thursday note. GM stock dropped 3% on Wednesday as Trump made his auto tariff announcement, then slipped as much as 6.5% on Thursday. Ferrari’s stock slid almost 5% on Wednesday but rose 1.6% on Thursday. Ford shares are down 2%. The S&P 500 Automobiles sub-index is up almost 2%, but down 28% year-to-date. Automakers had received a brief break from Trump’s earlier 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada after the president said all vehicles covered by the USMCA trade pact would not be subject to duties for one month. That exemption, which primarily benefitted companies like GM and Ford, ends next week. JPMorgan expects GM to face a $10.5 billion tariff bill, which could rise to $13 billion over time. The automaker imports vehicles from South Korea, Canada, and Mexico. Ford’s bill will be much lower, $2 billion to start, but will gradually rise to $4.5 billion. The analysts now expect the auto industry to take a $82 billion annual hit, up from an initial estimate of $41 billion, assuming that automakers absorb the cost of the tariffs. If they decide to pass the costs on to consumers, light-vehicle prices could rise by up to 11.4%. The Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group previously estimated that a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canadian imports would add between $4,000 and $10,000 per unit to vehicles assembled in North America. Trump’s tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel add another $250 to $800 per gas-powered vehicle and up to $2,500 on EVs. “Under the new scheme virtually all automakers will face significant pressure to raise prices, making it more likely domestic automakers will be able to effect price increases to better offset tariff costs without the risk of material market share loss,” Brinkman said in the note. Ferrari on Thursday became the first automaker to raise prices in response to Trump’s new tariff threat. The Italian company said exports to the U.S. after the tariffs take effect will be priced up by as much as 10%. However, exports of Ferrari 296, SF90, and Roma vehicles will not be subject to higher prices. The tariffs are expected to stick around. When asked how long the duties would likely stay in effect, Trump said they would be permanent. While practically all automakers have been making moves to lessen the effect of Trump’s tariffs, they still expect damage. “Let’s be real honest: Long term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canada borders would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we’ve never seen,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in February.

Actimab-A is an Ac-225 based radiotherapy agent, directed against CD33, a receptor overexpressed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other myeloid indications. Sandesh Seth, Chairman and CEO at Actium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. commented: "We believe that targeted radiation therapy with Actinium-225 is one of the most promising approaches for treating patients with myeloid malignancies and solid tumors. As we have highlighted recently, we are advancing our lead targeted radiotherapy Actimab-A into a pivotal Phase 2/3 trial for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia and in the frontline setting in a Phase 1 trial under our CRADA with the NCI. Additionally, we have launched our Actimab-A solid tumor program to combine with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors KEYTRUDA and OPDIVO for patients with head and neck squamous carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer in multiple trials. As a pioneer in the development of target radiotherapies, we have aggressive plans to expand our clinical pipeline to address indications with high unmet needs. With this supply agreement with Eckert & Ziegler, we will have access to reliable and constant supply of Ac-225 to advance our product development both in the U.S. as well as internationally." "We are happy to contribute to the continuous expansion of indications for Actinium-225, which is significantly being advanced by Actinium Pharmaceuticals," explained Dr. Harald Hasselmann, CEO of Eckert & Ziegler SE. "The progress we have made in our Ac-225 project over the past year marks only the start of our program to address the global shortage of this vital radionuclide." Eckert & Ziegler reliably supplies high-quality Gallium-68, Lutetium-177, Yttrium-90, and Actinium-225 to leading pharmaceutical companies, and research institutions worldwide. With expertise in radioisotope production and global logistics, the company is committed to continuously support the development and delivery of innovative radiopharmaceuticals.

"This additional approval for Breyanzi in FL represents a critical step forward in our mission to deliver on the transformational promise of cell therapy for more patients across Europe," said Emma Charles, senior vice president, Europe Region, Bristol Myers Squibb. "While significant advancements have been made in the last two decades, there still remains unmet need for patients. Newer treatments for FL, like Breyanzi, have shown impactful results in clinical trials, with the opportunity to deliver lasting results in the routine care setting."

Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS) recently announced that oral Fabhalta® (iptacopan) has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of adults with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), to reduce proteinuria, making it the first and only treatment approved for this condition. "C3G is a debilitating disease often affecting young people, impacting many aspects of their physical and emotional health, and our previous treatment options came with significant challenges," said Carla Nester, M.D., M.S.A., F.A.S.N., Professor of Pediatrics-Nephrology at the University of Iowa and Fabhalta APPEAR-C3G Study Co-Investigator. "This approval of Fabhalta is historic for the entire C3G community as now, for the first time, we have a therapy that is believed to treat the underlying cause of the disease, providing the potential for a new standard of care for patients." AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ: AZN) - New study results presented at the European Lung Cancer Congress (ELCC) 2025, March 26 to 29, demonstrate the role of AstraZeneca’s TAGRISSO® (osimertinib), as monotherapy and as the backbone for novel combinations, across stages and settings of epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Highlights include: Myung-Ju Ahn, MD, PhD, Professor of Hemato-Oncology at the Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea, said: "A critical goal in treating every patient with lung cancer is to not only extend a patient's life but also maintain quality of life while on treatment. The continued overall survival trend seen here at ELCC in the unresectable Stage III setting and the promising data for combinations that can address progression in the advanced setting, together reinforce osimertinib as an effective, safe and convenient treatment for patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer across stages and lines of treatment."

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough Senior Contributor. Tesla, Elon Musk’s electric car company, has seen its share price fall by almost half since its December highs (as traders eye a Federal Reserve “big catalyst”). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" Tesla, one of the so-called “Magnificent 7” tech stocks that includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia, has ridden a U.S. president Donald Trump stock market “bump" but is struggling amid a sell-off that led Musk to issue a crypto price warning. Now, as fears swirl a new, mystery threat is targeting crypto, Standard Chartered analysis has found replacing Tesla with bitcoin in the Magnificent 7 delivers higher returns and lower volatility—calling the index Mag7B. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has seen the company's share price collapse by almost half since it ... More hit an all-time high in December. "We find that Mag7B has both higher returns and lower volatility than the Magnificent 7," Geoffrey Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. "This suggests that investors can view bitcoin as both a hedge against traditional finance and as part of their tech allocation. Indeed, as bitcoin’s role in global investor portfolios becomes established, we think that having more than one use will bring fresh capital inflows to the asset. This is particularly true as bitcoin investment becomes more institutionalized." Bitcoin has seen huge Wall Street adoption in the last year as a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) become some of the fastest growing funds of all time and companies follow Michael Saylor’s Strategy in buying bitcoin as a corporate reserve asset. “If it were included, the implication would be more institutional buying as bitcoin would serve multiple purposes in investor portfolios,” Kendrick said, adding the Mag7B produced consistently higher risk-adjusted returns than the original group over the past seven years. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year but has fallen sharply along with Tesla and ... More stock markets in recent weeks. The bitcoin price has soared over the last year, boosted first by Wall Street and then by Donald Trump’s embrace of bitcoin and crypto on the campaign trail. The bitcoin price surged to almost $110,000 per bitcoin following Trump’s election victory and has since declined along with Tesla and other sky-high tech stocks as traders de-risk in the face of Trump’s tariff threats. “It’s true that replacing Tesla with bitcoin would improve the historic returns of the Mag 7 group,” John Haar, managing director at bitcoin-buying app Swan Bitcoin, said in emailed comments. “However, the same can be said for including bitcoin in favor of any stock in the group. Over the past 10 years, the best performer of the Mag 7 has been Nvida, which has returned approximately 70% per year. Bitcoin has returned approximately 80% over the past 10 years.”

Title: Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics announces layoffs

Time Published: 2025-03-27T11:16:45Z

"We did not make this decision lightly." Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics has announced a number of layoffs, calling it a "difficult decision". 17 "talented" staff have been affected by today's layoffs, the studio shared in a statement, though it's unclear which teams they are from. "Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected," Crystal Dynamics wrote. "We recognise how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach." The studio "remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games", it said, adding today's layoffs will not alter its current project plans. Crystal Dynamics is currently working on the next installment in the Tomb Raider series. Little is known about the upcoming game, which is being developed alongside Amazon. In 2022, Amazon said it would provide its "full support" to Crystal Dynamics, as it works on "the biggest, most expansive" series entry to date. Details have remained fairly sparse for the upcoming Tomb Raider since that time. In fact, all we really know right now is that it is being made in Unreal Engine 5 and will have "mind-bending puzzles to solve" and a "wide variety of enemies to face and overcome". In August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well".

17 people let go, including a senior combat designer Tomb Raider, Soul Reaver and Perfect Dark developers Crystal Dynamics are laying off 17 "talented team members" in order "to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success". According to a social media statement, they "did not take this decision lightly". Oh, and "this change does not alter our current project plans." It's not clear who exactly has lost their jobs, but going by this Xitter post, senior combat designer Mark Vernon is one of them. "Call me Mark S the way I just got severed, from employment," he writes. Best of luck finding your way to the black elevator hall, Mark V. (If you haven't watched Severance, I promise this reference is more hopeful than it sounds.) Crystal's current projects include a new Tomb Raider game, collaborations with Aspyr on various Tomb Raider and Legacy Of Kain remasters, and a collaboration with The Initiative on a reboot of Rare's Perfect Dark. The latter seems promising - reminiscent of Eidos Montreal's Deux Ex games in its blend of gadgetry and improvisation. "Cor, when was the last time a big new first-person game looked to have this kind of systemic flexibility," wrote Graham last year. "I'm partly just relieved to see a game trailer that looks like a game, and not a cutscene that looks years away from being playable. Although, notably, there was no release date at the end of this gameplay trailer, not even a year." Not much is known about the new Tomb Raider, which is being published by Amazon Games, and was announced prior to Crystal's acquisition by Embracer - the poster child for games industry layoffs since the lifting of Covid lockdown measures. Embracer announced plans last year to split themselves three ways in order to make more focussed use of the companies and brands scooped up during their earlier, feckless period of expansion. Right now, the Tomb Raider license is in the hands of one of these corporate spin-off entities, Middle-earth Enterprises. Hope everybody leaving Crystal Dynamics this week finds safe, rather than cold, harbour elsewhere. Yes, this is another Severance reference. I apologise if I'm being gauche.

Title: Will Mastercard Stock Fall To $320 On Recession Concerns?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/03/27/will-mastercard-stock-fall-to-320-on-recession-concerns/
Time Published: 2025-03-27T10:00:00Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team Contributor. MA Stock Question: How would you respond if you owned Mastercard stock (NYSE: MA) and it dropped by 40% or more in the next few months? While this might sound dramatic, it's not unprecedented—and it could happen again. Mastercard stock has actually outperformed the broader market in 2025, gaining around 4% since January, whereas the S&P 500 has slipped by 2% during the same period. This strong showing was fueled by better-than-expected Q4 2024 results, driven by increased payment and cross-border volumes. That said, potential headwinds are looming. Overall market sentiment has turned cautious amid rising fears of a U.S. recession triggered by tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump. This could significantly affect Mastercard, given its reliance on consumer spending and international travel trends. Here’s the point: Mastercard stock could face substantial losses in a downturn. In 2020, MA stock dropped by roughly 41% in just a few quarters, and during the inflation-driven sell-off in 2022, it fell around 29%—performing slightly worse than the S&P 500. This raises a key question: Could the stock tumble to $320 in a similar scenario? Individual stocks typically exhibit greater volatility than diversified portfolios. If you're looking for growth with less risk, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has beaten the S&P 500 and delivered returns of over 91% since inception. President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies—including a 20% tariff on Chinese goods and 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with tighter immigration rules—have sparked fears that inflation could make a comeback. These developments suggest that the U.S. economy may face serious challenges, even tipping into recession, as discussed in our analysis here on the macro picture. Earlier this month, the President didn’t dismiss the idea that these tariffs could prompt a recession. Given the rising uncertainty tied to these policies, the risks are worth watching. Add in global instability like the Ukraine–Russia conflict and ongoing trade disputes, and the economic outlook remains murky. Tariffs raise import costs, push prices higher, cut into consumer purchasing power, and reduce spending. These conditions could negatively affect Mastercard. If rising prices cause consumers to trim discretionary spending, Mastercard may see reduced transaction volumes. A potential recession—bringing job cuts and lower incomes—could worsen the decline in consumer payments. Additionally, companies managing tighter budgets might reduce spending, including on business travel and transactions. If travel slows due to global instability, Mastercard’s high-margin cross-border revenues—which have been growing rapidly—could take a hit, squeezing overall revenue and profitability. MA stock has held up slightly better than the S&P 500 during some past downturns. Concerned about what a market crash could mean for MA stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Mastercard Stock Go In A Market Crash? includes detailed performance analysis across previous market crashes. • MA stock declined 28.6% from a high of $396.75 on February 2, 2022 to $283.38 on October 12, 2022, compared to a 25.4% drop for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered by July 11, 2023 • As of March 2, 2025, it hit a high of $576.31 and is now trading around $550 • MA stock fell 41.0% from $344.56 on February 19, 2020 to $203.30 on March 23, 2020, while the S&P 500 declined 33.9% • The stock fully recovered by August 25, 2020 • MA stock plunged 62.8% from $32.00 on June 2, 2008 to $11.92 on January 20, 2009, compared to a 56.8% drop for the S&P 500 • The stock fully rebounded by August 3, 2011 At a current share price of around $545, Mastercard trades at nearly 34x projected 2025 earnings, which appears somewhat expensive. Although the company’s growth is solid, it isn’t exceptional—consensus estimates suggest annual revenue growth of about 11% for FY’25 and FY’26. Operating expenses have also been on the rise in recent years. On top of that, regulatory risks remain. The proposed Credit Card Competition Act, which aims to reduce merchant fees and increase competition in the payments sector, could challenge the market dominance of Mastercard and its main competitor Visa in the U.S. Considering the possible slowdown in growth and macroeconomic risks, ask yourself: will you continue to hold MA stock, or will you sell if it slides to $320 or below? Holding a stock in decline is always tough. Trefis, in collaboration with Empirical Asset Management—a Boston-based wealth advisory firm—has developed asset allocation strategies that posted gains during 2008-09 while the S&P fell over 40%. Empirical integrates the Trefis HQ Portfolio into its strategies to offer improved returns and reduced volatility versus the benchmark—a smoother investing experience, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
