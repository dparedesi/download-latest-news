But while Fold’s stock (Nasdaq: FLD) started off hot on the day, it quickly plunged. The Fold Bitcoin Credit Card will let users accumulate Bitcoin through everyday spending, offering up to 3.5% back on all purchases with no spending categories or deposit requirements, the company said. Users earn an unlimited 2% back instantly, plus up to 1.5% additional when paying through their Fold Checking Account. Enhanced rewards of up to 10% are available with major partners, including Amazon, Target, Home Depot, Uber, Starbucks, and hundreds of other brands. FLD opened at a price of $4.69 on Tuesday after closing at $3.88 on Monday. However, the buzz didn’t last, with the price plunging to $3.32 as of this writing, marking a more than 14% dip on the day. “Our credit card offers clear and compelling value and makes Bitcoin easily accessible to everyone,” said Fold founder, Chairman, and CEO Will Reeves, in a statement. “There are no categories to manage, no tokens to stake, no exchange account or balance requirements; just real Bitcoin, earned automatically with every purchase.” No timeline has been announced for the Fold credit card’s release. Stripe said that it has already processed over $3.1 billion in transaction volume and distributed more than $83 million in Bitcoin rewards. The company also holds 1,485 BTC in its treasury, worth about $167 million at present. Fold’s stock surged on Friday, roughly doubling in price and peaking above $7 per share amid speculation that veteran crypto industry investor Mike Alfred was joining the company. Instead, another publicly traded crypto company, Bakkt, announced Alfred’s appointment to its advisory board on Monday, prompting its own stock spike. Bakkt is up nearly another 18% so far on Tuesday, rising to $17.31 as of this writing. The price of FLD fell on Monday following the Bakkt appointment announcement, and has continued to fall on Tuesday. Even so, FLD remains up about 8% over the last week, though it’s down about 12% on the month. Bitcoin itself is roughly flat on the day at a current price of $112,774, but has fallen about 3% on the week. Myriad Markets users have recently turned bearish on the top cryptocurrency's chances of rising to $125,000—which would be a new all-time high mark—sooner than it can fall to $105,000. As of this writing, 53% of predictors expect it to hit the lower mark sooner than the higher price. That mark has grown substantially over the last week, rising from about 38% on September 16.

As it opens its new global headquarters in Canary Wharf, fintech giant Revolut has pledged to invest £3 billion in the UK, creating 1000 new high-skilled jobs over the next five years. 3 23 September 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. Revolut's pledge comes on the heels of last week’s £100 billion investment from asset manager Blackstone, £7 billion from BlackRock and £1.25 billion in inward investment from US financial firms including PayPal and Bank of America - generating 1,800 jobs in major cities including London, Edinburgh, Belfast, and Manchester. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, says: "Through our Leeds Reforms we’re making Britain the best place for financial services companies to do business, pushing us ahead in the global race for investment and putting more money in people’s pockets through the Plan for Change."Earlier this year, the Financial Times reported that Reeves had clashed with Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey over efforts to accelerate Revolut's authorisation as a fully-licenced bank, with Reeves eager to see the fintech get the greenlight as soon as possible.Revolut's UK commitment is part of a wider five-year global plan to invest £10 billion and create 10,000 jobs as it targets 100 million customers by mid 2027 and entry into 30 new markets by 2030.The firm is expecting to launch as a bank in Mexico next year, with entry into Colombia and Argentina also planned. Having secured a payments license in April, it is preparing to launch in India, while a push into Africa is underway, beginning with South Africa.Nik Storonsky, CEO, Revolut, says: “Our mission has always been to simplify money for our customers, and our vision to become the world’s first truly global bank is the ultimate expression of that. "From our roots here in the UK, we’ve grown to serve over 65 million customers globally, and today’s opening of our new Global HQ in London is the launchpad for our future. This HQ will be central to driving our growth towards our next milestone of 100 million customers."

Big Mike’s, the well-known restaurant in Blackrock, Co Dublin, is closing, with its owner citing “insurmountable challenges” in the industry. In a post on Instagram, chef and proprietor Gareth Smith said Sunday was the restaurant’s last service. “This is one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to write. It feels like failure, but it isn’t. We’re proud of what we achieved, we shot for the stars, poured everything into it – heart, soul, sweat, tears, life savings, even the house deposit – but the brutal truth is the maths just don’t math any more,” he wrote. He said he was proud of his team and grateful to his guests and suppliers. “My final act as gaffer is to go to bat for my staff so they land safely in new homes,” he added. A post shared by Big Mike’s Blackrock (@michaels_dublin) [ How Irish restaurants are changing to stay afloat: ‘Less people are going out. Thursday is the new Friday’Opens in new window ] Big Mike’s has been in operation since 2022. In an unusual approach, Mr Smith raised €400,000 of the €1.6 million start-up costs for the restaurant by forward-selling vouchers to a group of 40 regulars in his other outlets, Michael’s and Little Mike’s in Mount Merrion, both of which have since closed.

Title: House Oversight probes whether American retirees' pension funds are being weaponized: 'Progressive playbook'

‘Fox News Sunday’ anchor Shannon Bream previews her show on the FBI raid of former National Security Advisor John Bolton’s home and potential charges over alleged confidential emails on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.' FIRST ON FOX: The House Oversight Committee is setting its sights on insurance companies that may have discriminated against entities with right-wing views. The committee is also looking into whether retirees' pension accounts were being used to invest in progressive policies they may not necessarily agree with, Fox News Digital has learned. "The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is investigating improper restrictions on access to capital and capital markets of individuals and entities based on political viewpoints or involvement in certain industries (such as cryptocurrency, energy, and firearms)," Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., wrote to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). "The Committee has engaged with whistleblowers who had their insurance policies cancelled for widely-held political positions or for operating legal businesses considered out of favor by progressive activists." HOUSE PASSES TRUMP-BACKED PLAN TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer is expanding his probe into financial discrimination against right-wing entities and people. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The move is an expansion of the House Oversight Committee's ongoing investigation into whether public financial institutions engaged in debanking against people and entities with right-wing views. Comer is also probing whether companies implementing progressive policies are doing so at the expense of millions of retired Americans' personal investments. He wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in his capacity as acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that his panel "is investigating the prolific use of proxy proposals and other activism targeting corporate boards of directors by activists pursuing political agendas at the expense of the retirement and personal savings of Americans." BILL BARR TESTIFIES HE DIDN'T SEE INFO THAT WOULD 'IMPLICATE' TRUMP IN EPSTEIN CASE, COMER SAYS "Specifically, the Committee seeks to understand how giant investment managers and pension fund managers, aided by proxy advisory firms, sidestepped or abandoned their fiduciary duties to beneficiaries to pursue a political agenda and whether new legislation is needed to protect investors," Comer stated. "At a minimum, Americans deserve to fully know if their hard-earned savings are being used in a progressive playbook." The letter accused certain large asset management firms like BlackRock of putting clients' money into green energy initiatives, for example, rather than more profitable areas, in order to promote a left-wing agenda. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is pictured during a House Ways and Means Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on June 11, 2025. (Eric Lee/Bloomberg/Getty Images) BlackRock pushed back on such accusations in a public statement on its website, however. "One of the most critical tasks of an asset manager is to provide clients with insights on short- and long-term trends in the global economy that can impact their portfolios. We do this across all sectors – from healthcare to technology to energy," the company wrote. "Climate risk is one such trend given its implications for the economy. We believe that companies that better manage their exposure to climate risk and capitalize on opportunities will generate better long term financial outcomes." BlackRock's website also asserted that the "choice of where to invest ultimately rests with our clients." "We are bound to adhere to their investment guidelines and objectives. We do not dictate particular investment strategies," it said. And on a broader scale, the committee looking into whether publicly-traded companies are running afoul of President Donald Trump's executive order outlawing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices by simply listing it under another name. "[T]he Committee remains concerned following reports of publicly traded companies intentionally camouflaging or rebranding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies to hide such discrimination from "the Trump Administration, courts or influential activists,'" Comer wrote to several organizations opposing corporate discrimination, including the Alliance Defending Freedom. "At minimum, shareholders and retirement plan beneficiaries deserve transparency around discriminatory practices employed by corporate directors and officers as such behavior is rebranded. Replacing DEI and ESG titles with 'employee engagement' or ‘inclusion and impact’ represents yet another deceptive practice." President Donald Trump walks to Air Force One at Morristown Airport on Sept. 14, 2025, in Morristown, New Jersey. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Trump's order, signed in January 2025, barred financial institutions, major corporations, colleges and universities, law enforcement agencies and specific industries like medicine and commercial airlines from promoting or implementing DEI standards. Comer accused the previous White House of promoting discriminatory practices, however, in a statement to Fox News Digital. "The Oversight Committee is investigating discriminatory practices in the American financial system and the Biden Administration’s role in supporting them," he wrote. "Whether it is using the boardroom to achieve what the political left could not accomplish at the ballot box, or canceling Americans’ insurance policies and debanking them for their political views, these actions are wrong and deprive Americans of their constitutional rights."

Title: The surprisingly lucrative business of making a list of 500 stocks

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) Richard Drew/AP/AP hide caption This comes from the Planet Money newsletter. Subscribe now to get more insights into how our economy works delivered to your inbox each week. Once a month, from 1989 to 2019, David Blitzer walked into a well-appointed conference room with a view of downtown Manhattan to discuss the 500 largest and most important public companies in the U.S., the ones whose stock just about any American can buy. Blitzer was a member of, and then chair of, the committee that makes the S&P 500. It's like the Billboard Hot 100, except instead of ranking the most popular songs in America, it lists the most valuable companies. Sabrina Carpenter wants to keep releasing pop anthems that keep her on the charts; Boeing wants to keep selling enough planes to stay in the S&P 500. The S&P 500 is famous. It's cited constantly in newspapers and on TV; it's the basis of millions of investing-for-retirement plans. Less well-known is that S&P Global, the company that makes the S&P 500 and that employed Blitzer, is itself on the S&P 500 list. One reason why is that S&P Global makes hundreds of millions of dollars every year in revenue just from the S&P 500. The company has other larger businesses, like rating bonds, but its indexing business is particularly lucrative and profitable. How do you profit wildly from a list of stocks that seemingly anyone could make? And why don't competitors erode those profits? Answering those questions requires a better understanding of the infrastructure behind Americans' go-to investing plan. It also shows how millions of Americans have, often unknowingly, bet their life savings on a few tech giants and the hundreds of billions of dollars they've invested in artificial intelligence. Loading... The S&P 500 is what's known as a stock market index, and its purpose is to be a barometer. Is the stock market up today? Was it down last week? Until the late 1800s, those were not easy questions to answer. But in 1896, financial journalists Charles Dow and Edward Jones created the Dow Jones index by averaging the share price of 12 large public companies. (It later expanded to 30 large stocks.) They used it to inform their columns and increase sales of their flagship paper, The Wall Street Journal. In 1957, S&P released a competitor: its now-iconic list of 500 stocks. At the time, it was a triumph of new technology. Tracking 500 stocks and updating the index took much more work and computing power, especially since S&P updated the index hourly, rather than just once per day. (Now it's updated constantly, in almost real time.) Also, the S&P 500 accounts for the size of each company and the number of shares. It was an improvement on the Dow Jones Industrial Average's price-weighted approach. In the Dow, companies with higher share prices have a larger impact on the index. So Goldman Sachs, whose share price is around $802, is much more important than Apple, whose share price is around $245.50. In contrast, the S&P 500 is weighted for market capitalization, the total amount invested in each company (the share price x number of shares outstanding). So if Netflix stock is up 1% and Apple is down 1%, that will nudge the S&P 500 down. Which makes sense! Way more people have way more money invested in Apple ($3.5 trillion) than Netflix (just over $500 billion). So, overall, investors had a down day. The S&P 500 is widely considered superior to the Dow for tracking the state of the stock market. Nevertheless, when David Blitzer joined the S&P 500 committee in 1989, the Dow was still the definitive stock market index. People in finance respected the S&P 500 — many professional investors used the index as a benchmark to see whether they were "beating the market," and they paid for access to the S&P 500 and related data. But it wasn't much money. Just a few years earlier, in 1982, "the income was zilch, almost," Blitzer says. So what changed? Three new financial products helped turn the S&P 500 into the dominant index and a golden goose: In each case, the companies paid to use the S&P 500 name, data and methodology. That fee was based on how much money people invested in S&P 500 index funds and ETFs (or spent on S&P 500 futures). So if a schoolteacher invested $30,000 of retirement savings in Vanguard's S&P 500 fund, Vanguard might charge that teacher $15 per year and give S&P a chunk of that $15. These novel products did not immediately make the S&P 500 a gold mine. The products were new, and investors were skeptical. So S&P's fees were modest. Blitzer says that when he became chair of the committee, in 1995, there were around 25 employees devoted to the S&P 500 and two other indexes they published. But "it grew incredibly," he adds. "You know, it was a good ride." A key period, Blitzer says, came in the late 1990s, as the dot-com bubble inflated. New internet companies like Yahoo grew and grew, and Blitzer and his colleagues duly added them to the S&P 500. (Yahoo replaced Laidlaw, North America's largest bus operator. "What it says is that the internet slowly but surely is becoming a key part of the U.S. economy," Blitzer told reporters in 1999.) The manic increases in internet stock prices pushed the S&P 500 up and up. "For 15 or 20 months, or maybe two years or more, the S&P 500 outperformed like 90% of all the mutual funds and ETFs in the market," says Blitzer. In other words, Wall Street's elite money managers — whom Americans gladly paid fat fees every year to invest their savings for them — were making lower returns (less per dollar invested, especially after accounting for fees) from the stock market than people who'd bought SPY or Vanguard's S&P 500 index fund. Blitzer's simple list of 500 stocks was one of the hottest portfolios on Wall Street, and getting access to it was cheap. The fees for SPY and index funds were a fraction of what elite Wall Street firms charged. So more and more families moved their retirement savings out of the hands of those active investors and into S&P 500 funds. What they were essentially doing was betting that America's 500 largest companies would keep growing and making profits — which is a pretty good, safe bet. The creators of the index chose 500 companies because it approximated the entire stock market: S&P 500 companies typically represent more than 75% of the entire American stock market (in terms of size, or market capitalization). And even as internet and tech stocks made up a larger and larger share of the S&P 500, people who bought SPY or index funds were still well diversified, since they were also investing in energy, health care and consumer-goods companies — which cushioned their losses when the tech bubble burst. This trend of people moving their retirement savings into index funds and ETFs has continued for decades. By the time Blitzer stepped down as chair of the S&P 500 committee in 2019, he says, their index business employed around 700 people, and they'd created so many indexes (the S&P Southeast Asia 40, the S&P Emerging Under $2 Billion, the S&P Municipal Bond Water & Sewer Index) that he legitimately did not know how many existed. (In the early 2010s, S&P also bought a controlling stake in the Dow Jones indexes; Dow Jones & Co. retains some affiliation with the indexes, but no ownership.) But the S&P 500 remains the crown jewel. In 2024, S&P Global earned $1.6 billion in revenue from its indexes business. Most of that revenue came from firms paying to use the S&P name for $16.6 trillion of index funds and other investments. Of that $16.6 trillion, a whopping $13 trillion came from SPY, Vanguard's S&P 500 index fund and similar investments. As a director and senior analyst at Mizuho Securities USA, Sean Kennedy closely follows seven companies so he can advise customers on whether to buy, hold or sell their stock. S&P Global is one of them. I ask whether he ever worries about S&P's indexes business faltering. "No," he responds instantly. "I think their moat is so impenetrable," he says, that customers ask him only really about other parts of S&P Global's business. By a "moat," Kennedy means the factors that prevent competitors from launching their own indexes and conquering S&P's castle (i.e., its customers and business). According to Kennedy and Blitzer, that moat consists of three main factors: The S&P 500 does have competitors. The London Stock Exchange Group has the Russell Indices, and MSCI publishes popular ones too. But their most prominent indexes are complements to the S&P 500, rather than competitors. From the perspective of S&P's customers, says Kennedy, "there's really no one you can switch to." What also sets the S&P 500 apart is the committee that Blitzer headed up for more than two decades. Even many finance experts are surprised to learn that it exists. They expect the S&P 500 to be like a formula: You calculate which companies are the 500 largest, in terms of share price and number of shares, and then publish the list. S&P publishes its methodology on its website, but it leaves some wiggle room to achieve other goals of the index, such as mitigating turnover and keeping the list representative of the broader market. That wiggle room was Blitzer's domain. In the early 1990s, for example, the committee held off on adding Microsoft to the index because founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen still owned more than 50% of the shares. In other cases, if two companies merged, creating one corporation large enough to make the S&P 500, the committee might similarly wait to see how the new company (and its stock price) fared before adding it. Blitzer said in a 2020 Bloomberg podcast that they sometimes "got pounded" for these decisions but "learned to shrug our shoulders and say wait till next month." He also suspects the committee's existence, as well as the fact that no one could fully predict the list, gave the S&P 500 some "aura." Potential changes were always a gossipy topic in business and finance. Even within the S&P office, no one knew for sure what Blitzer would announce. Since Blitzer retired in 2019, it's now someone else's job to pick the 500 stocks and endure the criticism. (That's now easier, however, because S&P keeps all members of the committee anonymous, in part so CEOs would stop FedEx-ing them quarterly reports and financial literature to lobby for inclusion in the S&P 500.) The biggest criticism in recent years, though, is not about a specific stock. It's that the S&P 500 no longer broadly represents the stock market. Just seven tech stocks — Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, Tesla, Microsoft and Apple — have grown so huge that they make up more than 30% of the S&P 500. Increasingly, when the S&P 500 goes up or down, it reflects the performance of these "Magnificent 7" tech companies. Many economists, financial experts and money managers are concerned. Millions of people have invested trillions of dollars in S&P 500 funds with the idea that it's a well-diversified portfolio — a bet on the entire U.S. economy (or at least the large slice of it available to buy on stock markets), not a bet mostly on continued iPhone profits and AI chatbots becoming a profitable business. There are alternatives on offer. Firms like Vanguard offer index funds and other easy ways to invest in indexes of smaller companies, midsize companies, international stock markets or the "total" U.S. stock market — or to diversify into real estate. But as Blitzer points out, the Magnificent 7's domineering influence does not mean the S&P 500 is broken. The S&P 500 may be "pretty top heavy right now," but it has been top heavy before, in periods like the dot-com boom, and it still represents some 80% of American stock markets. The S&P 500 is doing its job: reflecting the state of the stock market and the investments everyone has decided to make. The point of the S&P 500 and the many investments based on it is to follow the markets — to trust its crowdsourced intelligence and not second-guess it or think you individually know better — because even though markets are sometimes very wrong, trusting them has an excellent track record over the long run. This is simply the state of our economy in 2025. Like it or not, it's increasingly a huge bet on a few tech giants and their massive investments in artificial intelligence startups, new data centers and AI being the next big thing.

Title: BlackRock’s crypto ETFs generate $260 million annual revenue

Time Published: 2025-09-23T15:59:53Z

BlackRock’s cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have emerged as a highly profitable venture, generating $260 million in annualized revenue, according to recent data shared by Leon Waidmann, head of research at the nonprofit Onchain Foundation. The revenue includes $218 million from Bitcoin ETFs and $42 million from Ether-based products. The performance underscores the growing role of regulated crypto investment products in institutional finance. BlackRock’s success is being closely watched by other traditional asset managers as a potential benchmark for launching similar offerings in the rapidly evolving digital asset sector. Analysts highlight the significance of BlackRock’s ETFs in positioning cryptocurrencies as a serious asset class within traditional finance. Waidmann likened the ETFs’ trajectory to Amazon’s early business model, noting that the funds provide a practical entry point into the crypto ecosystem for institutional investors and retirement accounts. “This isn’t experimentation anymore,” Waidmann said. “The world’s largest asset manager has proven that crypto is a serious profit center. That’s a quarter-billion-dollar business, built almost overnight. For comparison, many fintech unicorns don’t make that in a decade.” The performance of these ETFs may encourage more institutional players to enter the crypto market, extending the current market cycle beyond the typical four-year Bitcoin halving-driven patterns. Analysts suggest that inflows from corporate treasuries and ETF products could continue to drive demand for both Bitcoin and Ether. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is approaching a significant milestone, with total assets under management (AUM) nearing $85 billion. This accounts for approximately 57.5% of the total US spot Bitcoin ETF market, according to blockchain data from Dune. By comparison, Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF holds $22.8 billion, representing 15.4% of market share, making it the second-largest US spot Bitcoin ETF. The rapid growth of BlackRock’s fund is noteworthy given its short history, debuting on January 11, 2024. In less than two years, it has climbed from being the 31st largest fund across both crypto and traditional ETFs to the 22nd largest, according to VettaFi. Market analysts are optimistic that continued ETF inflows could support a renewed rally in Bitcoin prices. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget exchange, suggested that the institutional appetite for crypto ETFs helps establish a bullish floor for risk assets, reinforcing a “buy the dip” strategy amid ongoing macroeconomic and policy uncertainty. Additionally, there is speculation that the inclusion of cryptocurrency in US 401(k) retirement plans could further bolster demand for Bitcoin, with some projections estimating potential price targets as high as $200,000 by year-end, according to André Dragosch, head of European research at crypto asset manager Bitwise. BlackRock’s crypto ETFs illustrate the increasing intersection of traditional finance with the digital asset market. The funds’ performance demonstrates not only the profitability of regulated crypto products but also their capacity to attract institutional capital and provide a structured entry point for investors navigating the evolving crypto landscape.

Title: I've had an executive Costco membership for 10 years. It pays for itself — and then some.

Costco has always been a part of my life. I remember taking family trips to the warehouse as a kid and sharing soft-serve with my siblings. When I moved away for college, I still asked my parents to take me to Costco, often "borrowing" their membership card for big shopping trips to stock up on food and household items. Later, my partner and I went all in, splurging on our own executive membership and even getting the Costco Citi card. Now, as adults, we're at Costco multiple times each month, filling up on everything from gas to groceries. We make almost all our large purchases there, and have even booked Costco vacation packages. As a longtime shopper, I can confidently say the benefits of a Costco executive membership are worthwhile. Here's why I think it's worth upgrading to the higher membership tier. A standard Costco membership costs $65 a year, and the executive version is double the price at $130 annually. However, we recover the cost of the upgrade just by making qualifying purchases at the warehouse. That's because the executive membership comes with a 2% cash back reward, which allows shoppers to earn up to $1,250 back on qualifying pre-tax purchases. To break it down, this means that if we spend about $3,250 a year at Costco, we earn back the cost of the executive membership upgrade. If we spend a little more, we're making money to spend at the warehouse. Once a year — about two months before our membership renews — Costco sends a cash back voucher, which can be redeemed on future purchases. Plus, Costco has a membership satisfaction guarantee, meaning the company will refund the price of the membership at any time if you're not satisfied with it. In addition to the 2% cash back perk, Costco executive members can often access extra benefits. For example, the company recently started giving executive members a $10 monthly credit to use on same-day delivery through Instacart. The credit is automatically applied at checkout when we spend $150 (before tax). After returning home from vacation, this perk was a game changer. Instead of fighting the weekend Costco crowds to stock up on our favorite products, our groceries were delivered promptly to our doorstep. We were even able to snag a coveted rotisserie chicken. And speaking of vacations, executive members also get extra benefits on trips booked through Costco Travel. A few years ago, I purchased an all-inclusive vacation package to Costa Rica. As part of the deal, my friend and I each received $50 to use at the spa and a complimentary fruit basket for our room. Earlier this year, Costco announced it would be opening its doors for an additional six and a half hours each week for US executive members. Now, we can begin shopping at the warehouse an hour early on weekdays and Sundays. On Saturdays, we can enter half an hour earlier than other members. We recently attended this special shopping hour on a Sunday and noticed a stark difference. For example, my store typically has a line out the door to get in at opening, but we were able to stroll right in without bumping into anyone. We didn't even have to wait in line to check out. We'll likely make it a habit to go during these exclusive hours, as it made for a much better experience overall. I've been shopping at Costco for as long as I can remember, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Costco's greatest draws are its ability to provide value for the price and an unbeatable customer experience. For my partner and me, paying for the executive membership is a no-brainer. The 2% cash back means our $130 annual membership pays for itself. Plus, we love having access to all the premium perks. Jump to

Title: Maria Steen profile: Campaign for Áras attempts to paint her as challenger of status quo

Broadcaster Brendan O’Connor was in the plush Park Hotel in Kenmare for a family break, when he noticed a married couple with a “pristine” Mad Men kind of glamour who were also enjoying a weekend away. The RTÉ veteran would later recount how he struck up a conversation with the wife. She turned to him, “like something from a Tennessee Williams play”, and said: “I believe I have you at a disadvantage. I’m Maria Steen. I really hope there’s no hard feelings.” It was 2014, and O’Connor had earlier that year been plunged into a national controversy known as “Pantigate”. His Saturday night talkshow was forced into a €85,000 defamation payout after Ireland’s pre-eminent drag queen Panti Bliss had suggested on the prime time show that members of the Iona Institute and other conservative columnists were homophobic. The public broadcaster would be castigated after it emerged it had made the payout to John Waters, David Quinn, Dr Patricia Casey, Dr John Murray and Steen. Throughout the 2010s, the Iona Institute had become synonymous with a conservative resistance to social change. The Catholic think-tank was already bracing for the anticipated referendum on marriage equality the following year. By this point, Steen had emerged as one of its strongest campaigners with her staunch arguments against the 2013 Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act. Before 2012, the Iona Institute had largely avoided abortion debates because it felt the pro-life campaign space was saturated. But when the Fine Gael-led coalition moved to legislate for the X case in the wake of the death of Savita Halappanavar, the Iona Institute was galvanised and put Ms Steen forward as a spokeswoman against the proposed law. [ Independent Ireland votes to back Maria Steen’s candidacy for presidentOpens in new window ] Over 10 years later, Steen’s conservative comrades in the Iona Institute would only learn from The Irish Times that the stay-at-home mother was considering running for president. During Pantigate, Steen and her colleagues were seen by some as the last vestiges of the old Irish establishment. Now Steen is being presented by her backers as the only true anti-establishment voice in the presidential field, given her almost outré views on social issues. Ten years on from the marriage equality referendum, Steen’s campaign seeks to frame her as a trailblazing challenger to the new orthodoxy of progressive Ireland. Steen was raised in Ballsbridge and is the daughter of the well-known architect Seán Davin. Her aunts include former presidential candidate Joan Freeman and Theresa Lowe, the barrister and former RTÉ presenter. Her mother Margaret Davin taught her to read, write and tell the time before she started school, which Steen would cite as the foundation of her desire to homeschool her own children. She is married to senior counsel Neil Steen and they have five children together. They have enjoyed a comfortable south Dublin family life, with the 2016 renovation of their exclusive multimillion euro Blackrock home meriting an article in the property section of The Irish Times. Steen first qualified as an architect and then later as a barrister. As a mother she would qualify as a Montessori teacher and choose to work within the home. This would form the basis of her strong performance against the 2024 family and care referendums, particularly her advocacy of stay-at-home mothers. She is profoundly orthodox Catholic, and has opposed divorce and complained about “the death of procreative sex”. In 2018, the telegenic Steen became the No side’s most valuable weapon in their campaign to keep the Eighth Amendment. She dominated in an infamous television debate on Claire Byrne Live. The event was decried by the Yes side who claimed audience members had been jeering and sniggering. Steen did so well that the anti-abortion campaign tried to swap her out for fellow campaigner Cora Sherlock on a Prime Time debate the following week, resulting in a huge behind-the-scenes row with RTÉ. In the end, the show went to air with just one politician from each side: Simon Harris for Yes and Peadar Tóibín for No, which forced Miriam O’Callaghan to apologise to viewers for an abortion debate led by two men. Within Leinster House, many independents who don’t agree with Steen’s arch-conservative views are backing her on a freedom of expression basis. There is also a fear emerging among conservatives that in a three horse race, Catherine Connolly would “hand the presidency to the Government”. While there is a collegiate respect from many independents towards the liberal Connolly, many feel that Steen would present a greater challenge to the status quo.

Title: Crypto ETNs: what you need to know
URL: https://monevator.com/crypto-etns/
Time Published: 2025-09-23T15:11:08Z
Full Content:
Exciting news: after three years of prohibition, UK retail investors will again be able to buy exchange-traded notes (ETNs) linked to cryptocurrencies. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) lifts its ban on 8 October. Compliant products will likely hit mainstream brokers shortly thereafter. According to the FCA, 12% of UK adults own crypto assets (around seven million people) and 26% of non-crypto asset owners say, “they would be more likely to buy crypto assets if the market and activities were regulated.” In other words, crypto is gaining acceptance as a part of many people’s investment portfolios. (At least until the next crypto winter.) What we want to know is: That will do for starters. Exchange-traded products of all types (ETFs, ETNs, and ETCs) enable more everyday people to invest in an asset class without getting embroiled in all the hassle that direct ownership usually brings with it. You get the idea. With exchange-traded products, you can outsource the grief of asset ownership to trusted providers for a reasonable fee. However that doesn’t mean all exchange-traded products are the same. If you buy an MSCI World ETF then you can be pretty sure you are getting well regulated exposure to over a thousand leading stock market-listed companies. But ETNs are not ETFs. And crypto ownership entails different risks to share ownership. Importantly, you don’t actually own any crypto when you invest in this type of product. But the ETN issuer may well do. That exposes it and you to a steaming jungle of risks that I’ll touch upon below. Meanwhile the rest of this article will help you go into all this with your eyes wide open. The FCA has only green-lit the sale of crypto ETNs (not ETFs) to retail investors in the UK.1 The UK-approved crypto ETN headlines are: ETNs aren’t new. They’ve been used to track certain assets (like old-school currencies) long before crypto. Indeed crypto ETNs aren’t new either. They were offered to the UK public up until they were restricted in January 2021. And they’ve gathered billions in assets from UK professional investors and European retail investors since then. These existing products are obviously the ones most likely to come on-stream for retail investors after 8 October. Which is handy for us, because it means we can size them up beforehand. Crypto ETNs are issued by both traditional investment asset managers and crypto-native outfits. Familiar names that already offer ETNs in the UK and Europe include WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity, VanEck, and BlackRock. Crypto-focussed brands include 21Shares, Bitwise, Coinbase, and Valour. ETNs are debt securities rather than investment funds. In exchange for your cash, you get a promise that the issuer will pay you a return in the future. What happens if the ETN’s issuer defaults? In that case you may be paid less than you are owed – or not at all. In debt parlance, you’ll ‘take a haircut’. Probably one that feels more like the medieval lock-chopping practised by religious maniacs than a nice tint and blow-dry down your local salon. But what might prevent you from getting entirely mullet-ed in such a scenario is collateral. A ‘collateralised’ ETN protects the value of your investment with a big stash of assets lodged with an (ideally) independent and reputable custodian. Should your issuer be unable to pay, this collateral can be sold to honour the debt. You might ask does your issuer stow away enough collateral to cover the value of its obligations? Is the collateral good quality? Will it fetch enough on the market to pay back investors during a crisis? All good questions, which you’ll have to answer on a case-by-case basis (and by delving into the details provided by your ETN on its website). ETNs can be dated or undated debt instruments. You’d expect crypto ETNs to be undated – that is, for the security to be available so long as there’s a market for it and nothing blows up. But an ETN can be called. This means the issuer can redeem it at any time – paying back investors with the cash in the collateral kitty. It’s worth reading the ETN’s prospectus to understand what happens in the event your chosen product is redeemed early. Especially the sections on how the claims of other parties will be paid before the investors. You’ll likely come across choice phrases such as: …following satisfaction of all priority claims, such Security holders [that’s us!] may not receive payment of the Early Redemption Amount in full and may receive substantially less and may potentially receive nothing. There’s lovely. There’ll also be an early redemption fee to boot. So choose an ETN that’s stocked with plenty of collateral. The issuer is under no obligation to make any other assets available in the event of a shortfall. ETNs can be synthetic as opposed to physically backed. A synthetic ETN employs a swap-based derivative to deliver the performance of the underlying asset. This introduces another layer of counterparty risk, because the company providing the swap could fail. This may be moot for now, since it looks like only physically-backed crypto ETNs will be admitted to the London Stock Exchange. But it’s still worth checking if you’re compiling a shortlist of candidates. Here’s a quick USD comparison of the Bitwise Physical Bitcoin ETP (BTCE) versus Bitcoin’s market price. Source: Google Finance (26 Sep 2020 to 22 September 2025). Source: justETF (26 Sep 2020 to 19 September 2025). JustETF and Google Finance can’t quite agree on what five years is, so up next is the result I got when I matched the dates for a comparable long-term view: Dates: 26 Sep 2020 to 19 September 2025. (BTCE inception date: 9 Jun 2020, TER: 2%.) That’s an astounding return from Bitcoin either way – assuming you held on during the 77% death slide from November 2021 through November 2022. But still, BTCE gave up 5% a year in comparison to Bitcoin – a tracking difference that isn’t entirely accounted for by the ETN’s eye-watering 2% TER. Transaction costs, taxation, blockchain network fees, collateral overheads, brokerage charges, and various other operational frictions can all eat into your return without necessarily being captured by the TER. You’re also likely to see a clause like this nestled in a crypto ETN’s prospectus: The market value and price of the ETP securities does not exclusively depend on the prevailing price of bitcoin and changes in the prevailing price of bitcoin may not necessarily result in a comparable change in the market value of the ETP securities. Other ETNs may track their linked cryptocurrency more faithfully than BTCE. I haven’t checked other products or timeframes. But the point here is I’ve never seen such a large tracking difference gap when investigating vanilla ETFs tethered to mainstream asset classes. On that basis, I recommend checking the tracking difference performance of all your prospective ETN candidates versus their linked cryptocurrencies. It looks like being an important factor. Watch out for wide spreads, too. This is another cost of business that may vary widely, depending on the ETN’s liquidity and, at times, shifting perceptions of the creditworthiness of the issuer and any associated service providers. Reading the risk section of a crypto ETN’s prospectus is like visiting a chamber of horrors. Every grisly fate and sticky end your ETN could meet is listed. Or at least I hope it’s listed. Either way it’s an educational read and, if you’re on the fence about crypto investing, it could send you running in the opposite direction of the alluring 900% return graph I showed above. To give you a flavour, let’s pick out a few highlights from the risk section of the iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) prospectus. (To be clear this is just illustrative: I have no reason to believe that IB1T is a particularly risky crypto ETN.) What follows is a sample of the higher-dimensional risk space you enter when crypto is involved. It’s got more dimensions than string theory… …the Issuer’s bitcoin may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack, which may result in the value of the Securities being reduced, potentially to zero. A breach of the Issuer’s account at the Custodian or the Prime Execution Agent could result in the partial or total loss of the Issuer’s assets, which is likely to result in a partial or full loss in the value of the Securities. If any relevant Cryptoassets are lost, stolen, damaged or otherwise compromised in circumstances in which the Custodian, the Prime Execution Agent, another service provider to the Issuer or any other party is liable to the Issuer for such loss, theft, damage or compromise, the Custodian, the Prime Execution Agent or other responsible party may not have sufficient resources to fully compensate the Issuer. The security procedures in place for the Issuer’s bitcoin may include offline ‘cold’ storage, the use of multiple encrypted private key ‘shards’, and other measures designed to reduce the risk of the loss or theft of the Issuer’s bitcoin. However, these cannot guarantee the prevention of any loss due to a security breach, software defect or force majeure event that may be experienced by the Issuer or the Custodian… Crypto asset platforms are often unregulated in nature and may be vulnerable to manipulative trading activity, business failure, fraud and security breaches. In addition, if a crypto asset platform which a Series of Securities utilises for storage, trading and/or settlement becomes insolvent this may lead to a loss of the Issuer’s underlying assets and therefore a loss for the relevant Security holders. Crypto assets may be subject to attacks by malicious actors or groups of actors. If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power dedicated to mining on the Bitcoin network, it may be able to alter the Bitcoin blockchain on which transactions in bitcoin rely by constructing fraudulent blocks or preventing certain transactions from completing in a timely manner or at all (a ‘51% attack’). To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet did not yield its control of the processing power on the Bitcoin network, or the Bitcoin community did not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to the Bitcoin blockchain may not be possible. There have been a number of examples of 51% attacks on cryptocurrencies. …there is no guarantee that the current 21 million supply cap for outstanding Bitcoin, which is estimated to be reached by approximately the year 2140, will not be changed. If a hard fork changing the 21 million supply cap is widely adopted, the limit on the supply of Bitcoin could be lifted, which could have an adverse impact on the value of bitcoin and the value of the Securities. The cryptography underlying bitcoin could prove to be flawed or ineffective, or developments in mathematics and/or technology, including advances in digital computing, algebraic geometry and quantum computing, could result in such cryptography becoming ineffective. Any resulting reduction in the integrity of, or confidence in, the source code or cryptography underlying crypto assets generally could negatively affect the demand for crypto assets and therefore may adversely affect the value of Bitcoin and consequently the value of the Securities. Some developers may also be funded by entities whose interests are at odds with the interests of other participants in the Bitcoin network or with the interests of investors in bitcoin. A bad actor could also seek to interfere with the operation of the Bitcoin network by attempting to exercise a malign influence over a core developer. There is currently no tax certainty regarding the treatment of investments in crypto assets across various jurisdictions due to the novelty of the asset class. Accordingly, the taxation of the crypto assets and associated investments can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be subject to change, potentially also with retroactive effect. Any change in the tax treatment of the crypto assets could result in the Issuer incurring additional taxes… …and there’s plenty more where that came from. I’m not even getting into the regulatory risk, or the uncertainty over whether the issuer could legally enforce its claim to the ETN’s crypto collateral held with third-parties. Really, you could replace all 23,867 words in the prospectus’ risk section with the legend: AAAAARGH! Or as the issuer succinctly puts it: Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. Okay, let’s turn now to something more relaxing. Tax. A crypto ETN does not pay an income. Thus the only tax to worry about is capital gains – payable if you hold the product outside of your tax shelters. Also, if the ETN is domiciled outside of the UK then check it has reporting fund status. If not then capital gains will be taxed at income tax rates when you sell. That could hurt! Note that this reporting fund stuff doesn’t apply if you’ve safely stashed your ETN in an ISA or SIPP. When comparing crypto ETNs, look for: Cost of ownership – What’s the TER, bid-offer spreads, tracking difference? Collateral – What assets are held as collateral, how much is held versus the value of the product, are there daily disclosures, is the collateral insured and independently audited? The custodian – Is the keeper of the collateral independent and reputable? Securities lending policy – Can the collateral be lent out? That would invite yet more counterparty risk. Asset protection – Is the crypto mostly held offline in cold storage? Are the ETN’s assets segregated from other parties? Product structure – Is the ETN backed by physical cryptocurrency or another asset, or does it use synthetic replication (that is, swap-based derivatives)? Physical is usually safer. Price index – Google it. Is this index reputable? Does it definitely track the crypto’s spot price? ETN leverage – Look for a 1:1 ratio to ensure you’re getting a non-leveraged product. (Unless you actually want leverage, you complete and utter nutter.) Tax – Can I hold the product in my ISA or SIPP? If not, does it have reporting fund status? Early redemption, default, and failure – What does the prospectus say about these scenarios? Obviously none of this is investing advice. We’re just running through things to think about should you decide you want to research these new offerings for yourself. Personally, I can’t say I’m about to sink my life savings into crypto. But I will follow along with interest. I think crypto is an astounding phenomenon but I have grave doubts about its worth as an asset class in a wider portfolio. Of course, my views are neither here nor there. And even the FCA has caved to the inevitable, because swathes of Brits were opting to take their chances in unregulated offshore exchanges. Not to mention the various other crypto-powered vehicles that had crept onto the market. Is this progress? I don’t know. But I am fascinated. Take it steady, The Accumulator Thanks for reading! Monevator is a spiffing blog about making, saving, and investing money. Please do sign-up to get our latest posts by email for free. Find us on Twitter and Facebook. Or peruse a few of our best articles. Thanks very much for the detailed breakdown TA, I will stay away from crypto myself for many reasons but good luck to those who jump on board . TFJ @TA – thanks for this. Might be worth 1 or 2% of my SIPP, carved out of the gold allocation… Maybe. Blimey. I thought crypto was bad enough as it is before you stir in all this obfuscation into the pot. You can buy crypto on the open market. You can store it in a cold wallet, which you can back up the bejesus out of it. I hold gold via ETCs. The downsides to holding physical gold are obvious. And they just don’t apply to crypto. Buy your crypto and transfer to a cold wallet. Back up enough times as gives you peace of mind, sort of like the first pics of your newborn. Some in cloud, some printed. Now you have a bearer store of value – the greatest value of crypto is that you can run with it. I find no temptation to hold crypto with an ETN – it’s all added counterparty risk. I have to admit I don’t hold mine in a cold wallet yet, but that is because I am building up a position and it’s only £3k now, so I am good with coinbase and accept the risk. > And even the FCA has caved to the inevitable, because swathes of Brits were opting to take their chances in unregulated offshore exchanges. I’m not sure this is any sort of an improvement. It’s like a flawed sword that fails you in your hour of need. Buy it on the open market and you know you are in a nest of vipers, spivs and dodgy geezers, and it’s up to you to take life-changing amounts offline and keep them offline. What exactly is the FCA protecting you from that you couldn’t do yourself, we know here be dragons, adding a load more indirection and ways to crap out that they won’t protect you from strikes me as bonkers. There’s a delightful honesty to > Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. and the FCA hasn’t helped you with that one iota by adding even more ways to screw up and more counterparties to make off with the loot. Buying bitcoin needn’t be so damn complicated. It is inherently dodgy, because of all the risks to the underlying system which is not 100% understood, for all I know the ghost of Satoshi’s wallet may one day hold the entire edifice to ransom, and advances in computing could blow the whole thing up. Adding even more dodginess to the existing dodginess and calling is FCA approved dodginess + is bonkers. For the love of God, why? So maybe the small Alternatives section of the portfolio will now be: – SGLN – CMFP – IBIT or BTIP? Who knew!? We once held consoles so don’t be so mean. Think we sold at £30…..great investment we inherited there. Excellent piece. Thank you @TA. It had to happen. Usually, a thematic ETF launch is a sign of a big top, and an attempt to create exit liquidity for early investors. But here, with crypto, it’s our flat footed FCA who are to finger for the timing. At the time of the FCA ban on 6 October 2020 the price of Bitcoin was about £8,200. Today it is ~£84,000. Half a hand clap there for protecting consumers! What really caught my eye though is how this regulatory shift opens doors to hybrids like the 21Shares Bitcoin and Gold ETP (ticker BOLD, currently Zurich listed). While you rightly compare pure crypto ETNs to a wild ride, echoing your “AAAAARGH!” on the prospectus risks, BOLD feels like a more tempered option for diversification hungry passives like me. It’s physically backed, blending Bitcoin’s growth potential with gold’s potential inflation hedging stability via monthly inverse volatility rebalancing (around 60/40 split lately). It’s a nod to Ray Dalio’s all-weather portfolio ethos, where gold acts as a ballast against Bitcoin’s volatility swings. It’s not FSCS protected, and those operational risks and frictions (Blockchain fees, custody issues) all apply in spades, but the 0.65% TER is ‘competitive”in this space, and its performance since 2022 (over 130% cumulative) shows some resilience in choppy markets. For fellow passives, BOLD could possibly be a part of that 5-10% satellite allocation to less / negatively / uncorrelated assets; enhancing diversification without upending a core equity index tracking approach. I’m not all in with it, or crypto more generally, though, and your skepticism here resonates. But in a world of persistent inflation, deficits and fiat doubts, maybe it’s worth a look. I do have to say though that, IMO, there’s a massively underated (and under thought through) growing risk in relation to Blockchains like Bitcoin’s from quantum computing advances. I’ve commented on this before on Monevator, but here’s a recent YouTube piece covering this ground: https://youtu.be/HKcVpZIsP6k?feature=shared The TL:DR (with timestamps) is that quantum computers could deduce private keys from public keys, allowing attackers to steal funds from existing wallets [36:57]. Older, dormant wallets, including the legendary stash of Satoshi, are particularly vulnerable because their public keys are already exposed on the Blockchain [37:06]. Upgrading a decentralized network like Bitcoin requires global consensus, which is a slow and challenging process given the networks decentralisation and diversity [58:22] necessitating a “hard fork,” that could divide the community and prevent a timely enough decision [01:23:57]. Millions of existing wallets, especially older ones whose public keys are already exposed, cannot be retroactively updated, remaining permanently vulnerable [00:39:50] Transitioning the entire digital infrastructure of BTC is akin to replacing the nervous system of civilization mid-flight [01:25:03]. Despite repeated warnings, the crypto ecosystem still lacks any sense of urgency, viewing the threat as distant or inconvenient. Yet the consensus from experts (Gartner analysts estimate a 50% chance of disruption by 2037 [49:59]) and major financial institutions like BlackRock (who are massively involved in crypto ETPs) is that the quantum computing threat to Blockchain is real, and increasingly near term [01:09:06]. Thanks for the thorough breakdown; it’s armed me to tread (exceeding) carefully after 8th October! Here be dragons … and their treasure (maybe). @DeltaHedge #6 > BOLD – 50:50 gold:BTC, 0.65% OCF Oy vey, truly we are in the End Times. For starters, why 50:50? Secondly go git yourself the gold ETC from any of the ones listed here at 0.12% and match with your preferred ration of BTC bought straight off, and save yourself 0.55% fees. Job done. I share the BTC computing advance worry. As the man said > Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. IMO you only need some BTC to leaven the mix, 50:50 is way too much BTC IMO. But I suppose if you are a GenZ moonshotter, well, the sky’s the limit @ermine #8: yep, it ain’t cheap, but you can’t really fairly compare it to a plain vanilla gold or even to a Bitcoin ETP. Allocation is fully dynamic on this one – rebalances monthly using an inverse volatility weighting mechanism to equal risk exposure (i.e., higher volatility assets like Bitcoin get a lower weight, but this adapts as the relative share of volatility between gold and Bitcoin changes). As of 22nd September, allocation was approx 62% Bitcoin and 38% gold (this fluctuates; earlier reports, from when Bitcoin was relatively more volatile, sometimes reference 25% Bitcoin / 75% gold split, but it’s not fixed). Your nearest fee comparator is perhaps an active fund (get out the garlic and the silver crosses on that one!) or something quanty. Fascinating (worrying?) how something ostensibly so easy in which to dabble can have such complex issues. I think my attraction to diversification is overtaken by simply not understanding this well enough, even with this excellent piece, thanks @TA. Maybe no current need for impenetrably complex asset classes for a GenZ moonshot – even in its pre-retirement de-risked state, portfolio is zooming! A bit frothy perhaps, but at least a risk I can get my head round. As I mentioned on a previous post – this is the FCA doing what they do – ineptly making sure retail don’t have the opportunity to make money. Crypto bad at $12000 per BTC. We protect you from this volatile instrument Crypto fine at $120000 per BTC. Fill your boots. I’ve held the Ethereum ETN since 2017 in my sipp. The last ban coincided with the very start of the pandemic bull run. I had wanted to buy the BTC one. But no. HL even slapped it with an immediate ban on purchase in Oct 2020 prior to the fca actually stopping it. “The FCA have said it’s unsafe”. You what?! I screamed at them down the phone for doing so but was too lazy to move my sipp. They did the same with Rhodium under the guise of not having a KID for the deutschebank etf, coincidentally just before the 2018 bull run. Fortunately I’d bought some prior. Jokers. It bears saying again. They are perfectly fine with people buying stocks that can go to zero. I’ve bought plenty over the years. No protection – and neither did I want any. Let us make our own choices. Excellent – thank you. Crypto not really my thing, but as you say interesting to follow, and anyway this is not really about Crypto, but about ETNs – makes sense but had no idea the tracking was so bad! Hadn’t seen this elsewhere so really great to have all this info laid out. Thanks for the article. I enjoy reading about crypto and at the same time I have no desire to touch it with my own money, The FT has an interesting article about companies pivoting to holding crypto and buying back their own shares https://www.ft.com/content/573be235-56a6-4556-90af-a8eac887dbf9 It’ll all end in tears, it’s just the next dodgy financial product waiting to reel in unsuspecting investors before it goes bust. > The cryptography underlying bitcoin could prove to be flawed or ineffective, or developments in mathematics and/or technology, including advances in digital computing, algebraic geometry and quantum computing, could result in such cryptography becoming ineffective. > Any resulting reduction in the integrity of, or confidence in, the source code or cryptography underlying crypto assets generally could negatively affect the demand for crypto assets and therefore may adversely affect the value of Bitcoin and consequently the value of the Securities. I agree with Delta Hedge with regards to the vulnerability of Bitcoin to quantum computing attacks, and appreciate The Accumulator bringing it up in the article. Also smart for iShares to enumerate it, though wording it as “could become ineffective” rather than “will soon become ineffective” strikes me as undeservedly optimistic. Right now, bitcoin is like a company with ~30% free floating shares. When quantum computing attacks release assets from all the wallets whose owners have lost the keys, the float will go up, depressing prices. When some of the actively held wallets get drained, there will be less demand for buying leaky buckets and it will be a fun show to watch. On the other hand, quantum bitcoin miners could reduce the energy footprint Etherium has previously had a hard fork to reverse a hack – they might have more direction with the creator (Vitalik Butlerin) still involved in attempting to transition to Post-Quantum Cryptograpthy, but I don’t envy their chances @ermine (or anyone else who has experience of buying bitcoin!). Could I perhaps ask you a question as you seem to have a handle on bitcoin. I purchased a small chunk many years ago. It has been on my to do list to look at buying more as a diversifier. I hold with blockchain. When I look to purchase via blockchain a £100 purchase has fees (and perhaps a spread) of £2.99 (2.9%). A purchase of £1200 would have fees of £41.88 (£3.39%). Similar quotes on my coinbase app (which I have not purchased through yet) are £100 @ £3.89 and £1200 @ £46.00. Is this typical of the level of fees I would have to incur to buy bitcoin direct? Or am I missing something…. This is great @TA – the list of risks is an actually a good route in to better understanding of crypto generally. EG 51% attack! @ermine your comments make sense to me too. And thanks to @delta hedge for excellent further elaboration. Thanks again for covering this topic @Pikolo — Hi! You write: Also smart for iShares to enumerate it, though wording it as “could become ineffective” rather than “will soon become ineffective” strikes me as undeservedly optimistic. I suppose this is because iShares have lawyers drafting legal documents, rather than the rather lower bar of us anonymous commenters on the Internet… 😉 From what I’ve read the consensus of quantum computing really threatening cryptography ranges from 15 years away to ‘never’ which would seem to give plenty of time for Bitcoin to transition to a post-quantum cryptography world *if* required. There should be plenty of signposts along the way, too, given the apparent challenges of scaling quantum computers. Moore’s Law doesn’t seem to apply, at least pending some kind of novel breakthrough. Of course ‘will’ might still arguably apply in my more optimistic scenario, but then there’s a lot of ‘wills’ that we don’t write into legal documents. My house will eventually crumble, and the Earth will be consumed by the sun. Not for me to worry about though. 😉 Also, we have to understand that a quantum computing world with genuinely useful compute-at-scale would be upending cryptography (and much else besides) all over the place, IMHO. It wouldn’t be a niche sideshow for crypto blogs and social media timelines like today. TLDR: I think Bitcoin has time to adapt, and I don’t see why 51% of those who control the network wouldn’t move to do so if required. @Ian #16 I took a look at my last Coinbase (advanced platform) transaction for BTC in GBP, placed at 9/19/25 21:59, filled at 06:59 the next day 0.00133763 BTC for £84,798.17 subtotal £113.43 fee 0.40 (I am post only, I do not allow taker) total £114.83 > Similar quotes on my coinbase app (which I have not purchased through yet) are £100 @ £3.89 I am an old git and I don’t use apps, and very definitely not for finance, I use the web interface. But this looks very high for coinbase. Have you switched to CB pro on the app – Coinbase regular does have high fees, I didn’t realise they are that high Now this is Bitcoin, so there are many areas where spivs can take you for a ride. Coinbase may be offering a poorer rate than other exchanges at any instant in time and finessing fees there. It’s hard to determine, given the shocking volatility. Cryptoradar shows the best exchange for any asset. I do not want a relationship with more than one exchange, the more people have your details the more chance of spivs hacking them. If/when I have a worrying amount on an excahnge I will bump the BTC into a cold wallet. IMO crypto is definitely something that should be held at the very end of your bargepole, and I only do BTC and ETH, mainly BTC. And I am mustelid, not whale, in the size of the holding, because in gold I trust. I have direct wallet experience in another cryptoasset, and the feeling I get there is that fees are higher for small transactions I did find the BOLD concept interesting, that’s BTC and gold. I can’t find the reference now, but basically BTC is a risk-on asset and gold isrisk-off fear, all other things being equal, which they aren’t at the moment. A small amount of BTC (~5-10% max) as a proportion of a gold + BTC has some merit, particularly if you rebalance it every so often – monthly seemed the target. I am not sure I CBA with that, but I have a paltry BTC holding, probably much less than yours as I am Johnny-come-lately, I was in then out, and more recently in with the BOLD idea. I am not the typical Monevator reader though, because I have reached where I want to be and have flicked the engines to cruise. Nobody who is trying to make their fortune should hold large amounts of non-productive stores of value. I hold about half in equities which is probably low round here. I absolutely respect TI/TAs right to kick this comment very far into touch as it’s dangerously active in a pretty dangerous asset class. Perhaps this was in the post and I overlooked it, but can anyone tell me why an ETN – which seems a rather complicated financial instrument – allowed but a straightforward ETF equivalent to SGLN is not? EDIT: I’ve just spotted that SGLN is an ETC not an ETF, so perhaps that’s also complicated and I just didn’t know! Not my area of expertise by any means (!), but is there any risk that Crypto ETNs, being debt securities, are treated by HMRC as deeply discounted securities for UK tax purposes, such that the entirety of any net return is taxed as income (and not as capital gains) outside a tax free wrapper? Probably nonsense but grateful for any thoughts. @Steve Lemon #20 I’ve held SGLN in the past and HL tells you that you can hold it in an ISA, SIPP or LISA. As you say it is an ETC, but a refreshing simplicity compared to this ETN. @TI #18: That’s a thoughtful and well-articulated argument for optimism, but…. ​ What about harvest now, decrypt later? Even if the breakthrough is 15 years away, encrypted data (including Bitcoin public keys from older wallets) can be collected today and stored. Once a powerful quantum computer is operational, those keys can be cracked retroactively, immediately emptying millions of coins, including Satoshi’s. This vulnerability can’t be patched. ​The assumption that the Bitcoin community will quickly agree to a hard fork for survival may be optimistic given past difficulties. The transition to a post-quantum algorithm would require a complex, consensus driven network (10,000+ nodes) upgrade. The debate to implement Segregated Witness (SegWit), which involved a much less radical change than a fundamental crypto-system swap (and was part of a compromise solution to double the effective block size from 1MB to ~2MB), took over three years of intense, acrimonious public debate before it achieved its lock in signal in mid-2017. There’s no small well coordinated aligned group with 51% of the hashing power who can push this through. This is maybe more akin to the situation with CDOs and RMBS in the run up to the GFC, where the banks failed to act in their own (and their own shareholders’ and senior employees’) self interests, despite a fair few voices pointing out well in advance (although admittedly, and ironically, a bit too early as it turns out) that the whole house of cards would topple. ​ While the consensus on quantum computing timelines is indeed wide, the defense must be 100% successful and proactive. The attacker only needs one successful, secret breakthrough to compromise the system before the slow, global consensus process completes. This is an existential threat, not merely one of many. The current security of a multi trillion dollar asset cannot rely on the hope that a catastrophic breakthrough adheres to a predictable signpost schedule giving the many disparate parties involved time to agree all aspects of the fundamental changes to Bitcoin’s core protocol. In contrast, the board of a centralised commercial institution like a bank or a fund platform could move PDQ if required to implement post quantum cryptography. FWIW, my guess is that someone like North Korea’s now infamous Lazarus Group would, in the future, try and execute a heist / disruption Op like this, possibly with either active PRC assistance or their wilful blindness (Lazarus have been behind some of the very biggest and most challenging recent crypto hacks/thefts – they’re a front for the Reconnaissance General Bureau of the General Staff Department of the Korean Peoples’ Army and, it’s fair to say, are pretty hardcore and deep under the radar when it comes to these sorts of mischief). @TI “.. I think Bitcoin has time to adapt..”. The great thing about gold is that it doesn’t need to adapt. It’s elemental. Bitcoin, crypto.., is just a mathematical construct that will need lots of shape-shifting over time. Every time I think of bitcoin, the tech bros, and agent orange…, a huge “Uh.., no thanks..”, appears in my mind. “Meanwhile the rest of this article will help you go into all this with your eyes wide open.” Oh no it won’t. I remember the old Canadian joke: “A gold mine is a hole in the ground with a liar standing next to it”. Softly softly flee from monkey.

Title: Steven Pinker on Speculation Bubbles, Super Bowl Ads, and What Leaders Need to Know About Group Psychology
URL: https://hbr.org/podcast/2025/09/steven-pinker-on-speculation-bubbles-super-bowl-ads-and-what-leaders-need-to-know-about-group-psychology
Time Published: 2025-09-23T14:40:00Z
Full Content:
A conversation with psychology professor Steven Pinker on a powerful force that unites us. As a leader, psychology is fundamental to your success – whether that means understanding consumer behavior, team dynamics, or even your own biases and blind spots. Harvard professor Steven Pinker says that an important phenomena to understand is that of common knowledge and its downstream effects. It’s the idea that there is power in knowledge, but also power in knowing what other people know – and that when a large group of people know what others around them know, and vice versa, that’s when major change can happen. He explains how common knowledge underlies meme stocks, the rise of crypto, meeting etiquette and the success of Super Bowl ads. Pinker wrote the new book When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows . . .: Common Knowledge and the Mysteries of Money, Power, and Everyday Life. ADI IGNATIUS: I’m Adi Ignatius. ALISON BEARD: I’m Alison Beard, and this is the HBR IdeaCast. ADI IGNATIUS: All right. So Alison, the more I think about leadership, the more I think that leading effectively is almost all about psychology. ALISON BEARD: Yeah, I can see what you mean. You need to understand consumers’ wants and needs, your employees’ wants and needs, your business partner’s wants and needs. Really anticipating everything that stakeholders might do or think. ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah, exactly. I think successful leaders need to think on multiple levels, both to cope with the complexity of their jobs and to outthink their competition. So our guest today, Steven Pinker, is all about the power of knowledge. Understanding what we know, what we don’t know, and most importantly, whether or not others know what we know. So I know that sounds very Donald Rumsfeldian, but there is power in understanding all of this. ALISON BEARD: Yeah, it does sound very meta, but Pinker is an expert in explaining very complex topics in a way that feels understandable and applicable to our everyday lives. So I’m interested to hear what he has to say. ADI IGNATIUS: Absolutely. So Pinker is a professor of psychology at Harvard University, author of the new book, When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows: Common Knowledge and the Mysteries of Money, Power, and Everyday Life. It’s a book that helps explain everything from the power of Super Bowl ads to the rise of cryptocurrency, to the unspoken rules of how we interact in the office. Here’s our conversation. ADI IGNATIUS: Steven, thank you for being with us today. STEVEN PINKER: Thanks for having me. ADI IGNATIUS: Great. So, your book is about common knowledge, what it is and how we use it and in ways that we’re aware of and in ways that we aren’t aware of. So, for the audience, what are you getting at with common knowledge and why should we care about that? STEVEN PINKER: I’m using the term specialized sense, not to refer to conventional wisdom or something that is widely known, but to something that is known to be known. That is I know something, you know it. You know that I know it. I know that you know it. You know that I know that you know it, and so on ad infinitum. So, that’s common knowledge in the technical sense. It’s important because it’s necessary for coordination for two or more people to be on the same page to make choices that might be arbitrary, but it works for everyone as long as everyone makes the same choice. Do you stay home on Saturday or Sunday? Do you drive on the right or drive on the left? Now for common knowledge to work, you don’t literally have to think, “I know that she knows it. I know that she knows.” Because your head starts to spin after one or two levels, and technically, common knowledge requires an infinite number of them, which can’t fit inside a single head. But we have a sense of common knowledge when something is conspicuous or self-evident or public or out there. If I see it while I see you seeing it, then I know that you know that I know that you know it. ADI IGNATIUS: So this is the emperor has new clothes. STEVEN PINKER: Well, I begin the book with the story of the emperor’s new clothes because there’s a sense in which it’s a story about common knowledge. When the little boy said the emperor was naked, he wasn’t telling anyone anything they didn’t already know. But he’s changed the state of their knowledge nonetheless because by blurting out what everyone could see within earshot of everyone else, at that moment, everyone knew that everyone else knew that everyone else knew that the emperor was naked. And another point in the book is that just like driving on the right or driving on the left is a solution to a coordination problem or staying home Saturday or staying home Sunday, respecting paper currency, I suggest that our informal social relationships. Are we friends? Do I defer to you? Are we transactional partners? Are we lovers? All of those are matters of common knowledge as well. They’re coordination games and we solidify them by generating some public signal that we both see that inaugurates the relationship. There can be forms of common belief, common misconception, common pretense where you do have assumptions about what other people are thinking and vice versa, that in some cases may not actually be a reality. In the case of a common pretense where we refer to that by saying, “We’re ignoring the elephant in the room,” the metaphor is that an elephant in the room is something you can’t ignore, but we’re pretending to ignore it. Sometimes there is a phenomenon called pluralistic ignorance or a spiral of silence. In economics, it’s sometimes called the Abilene Paradox, where no one actually believes something, but everyone thinks that everyone else believes it, but no one actually does. ADI IGNATIUS: Is there an easy example of that? STEVEN PINKER: Sure. It was originally studied in a fraternity where all the frat guys said privately that it’s really stupid to drink until you puke and pass out. But they said, “What can I do about it? All the other guys think it’s cool.” It turns out none of them thought it was cool, but everyone thought that everyone else thought it was cool. There’ve been many phenomena like that. It turns out that in Saudi Arabia, most of the men think that women should have the right to work and drive, but they couldn’t allow their wives to do it because they mistakenly thought that all the other men thought that it was impermissible. ADI IGNATIUS: So I want to lead this conversation mainly into economic, financial, market areas but your book, I’d say it’s challenging in some ways. There are a lot of brain-teasers, there are a lot of prisoner’s dilemmas, things like that, but it’s also fun. I mean there are a lot of popular references, jokes, cartoons, and then examples. So, one of the things you talk about is the Keynesian beauty contest. Which – and if I get it wrong, you’ll correct me, but where a judge doesn’t simply select the contestant that he or she thinks is the most attractive, but rather is rewarded on selecting based on what he or she thinks the other judges will select, right? STEVEN PINKER: Who are engaged in the same puzzle. ADI IGNATIUS: In the same thing. STEVEN PINKER: They’re guessing what everyone else will judge to be the prettiest face, which is different from the old Miss Rheingold competition where people voted on the prettiest face. In the beauty contest that Keynes hinted might have been in the newspapers in his day, this would be London in the ’20s. No one can ever actually verify whether there really was such of a contest. But it was a great example because for Keynes where he said, “Everyone is trying to out-guess other people out-guessing still other people.” He said, “That’s the way speculative investing works.” They buy the security because they think they can sell it at a higher price to other people who think it’s underpriced, who in turn will want to sell it to still other people. Speculative bubbles, crypto perhaps being one of the most recent examples, are cases where people think that other people in the future will want to buy in, something that’s called the greater fool theory of investing that you invest because you think other people will invest because they think that still other people will invest. The thing is, of course, bubbles can pop when the market starts to run out of the greater fools who think that it’ll continue to appreciate forever. But this can all get started when there is some public signal. In the case of the emperor’s new clothes, the boy blurting it out, or like a public ceremony or a public signal where if there is just a rumor or some reason to think that other people are getting in, that can cause other people to get in. A couple of recent examples are meme stocks where an influencer might talk up a stock even if the fundamentals are terrible, pretty crummy. But the fact that other people know that he’s talking it up and they know that still other people are talking up means that it really can appreciate at least for a while. Two Super Bowls ago, there were a number of high concept ads for crypto exchanges, which mentioned nothing about the advantages of crypto. ADI IGNATIUS: I remember that. These are the Larry David ads. STEVEN PINKER: The Larry David, the Matt Damon, where the point of the ads were everyone’s getting into crypto, don’t be left out. In fact, the punchline to the Larry David comic ad was, “Don’t be like Larry, don’t be left out.” ADI IGNATIUS: So this sounds like a tool that people who understand the psychology could and probably do benefit from, right? STEVEN PINKER: Yes. Getting back to marketing, I talk about an analysis by a political scientist like Michael Chwe, who is in some ways my predecessor in writing a book about common knowledge where he analyzed the most famous and most expensive ad in history. This was the 1984 ad directed by Ridley Scott of Blade Runner and Alien and Fame. It ran exactly once during the 1984 Super Bowl and it was to introduce the Apple Macintosh. It was a revolutionary new product. Unlike those of us who remember the first personal computers, remember it had a little screen with 24 lines of 80 characters and you had to type in alphanumeric commands like del, fubar, fu.bar, and they were error-prone. They were clumsy. So, Apple’s coming out this insanely great new product with windows and menus and icons and a mouse. But they realized that no one would buy it if they thought they were the only one buying it because the price wouldn’t come down because of demand. There wouldn’t be a community of users and experts. So, how do you break the knot and cut the knot and get people to buy something that they’ll only buy if other people are buying it? The answer is the Super Bowl is an annual right in American culture. You know that a lot of people are watching it and you know that a lot of people know that a lot of people are watching it. It is a common knowledge generator. To break the logjam, Apple paid for this ad. It said nothing about the Apple computer, for those of you who have seen it. It played off the fact that it was January 1984, the date of George Orwell’s novel. So, it showed a grim corporate meeting where gray drones trudge into a cavernous hall and listen to drivel from a voice on the screen, intercut with scenes of a live young woman in a bright red gym shorts and a singlet carrying a mallet. She bursts into the corporate meeting, hammer throws the mallet into the screen, which explodes in a fireball revealing the crawl that says on January 25th, Apple will introduce the Macintosh and you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like 1984. Now, the point of the ad was not to advertise the product, it didn’t say anything about the product, but to advertise the audience for the potential buyership. It generated common knowledge. I’m seeing the ad. I know lots of other companies are seeing the ad. What Chwe showed… I mean, it’s a story. How did he prove it? I mean, that’s just a sample of one. So, he looked at other products that only work if enough other people adopt it, products that depend on network effects. Monster.com was one of the first job-seeking ads. Now, why would anyone look for a job on Monster.com unless they thought that lots of employers were posting there? Why would employers post there unless they thought a lot of job seekers were looking for jobs there? Monster.com was introduced at the Super Bowl. Another example is the Discover credit card, which was great credit card, rebates, and high limits, but didn’t matter if you were the only one who had a Discover card because no merchant would accept it and no merchant would accept it unless they thought enough people were going to carry it, introduced in the Super Bowl. Chwe argued that it was another category aside from products that inherently depend on networks, they’re prestige goods that depend on other people that you respect also consuming that product. As far as language, sneakers are sneakers, but for some people, it matters whether they’re the person who wears Nikes or Adidas. An American beer is American beer, but for some people, like being a Bud drinker is just different from being a Coors drinker and products that are consumed in public and where the brand image is important also tend to advertise in the Super Bowl. Crucially, what Chwe showed was not so much that advertisers willing to pay per eyeball, but they’re willing to pay a premium for venues that were common knowledge generators, where it was known that a lot of people were to watch them. They’re willing to pay more per eyeball for products that were consumed in public or that depended on network effects. ADI IGNATIUS: So, maybe the flip side of this phenomenon is the toilet paper shortage during COVID, which was not this, not network effects, but an assumption that I know what you know that I know that you know that. STEVEN PINKER: Well, yes. So, economist named Justin Wolfers speculated that the great COVID toilet paper shortage was like a bank run where people withdraw their money, not necessarily because they think that there’s anything wrong with the bank, but they have heard that other people think there might be something wrong on the sound. They might just have heard that other people think that might be something. That that’s not how it sounds. So, you get this reverberant doubt, and no one wants to be the last customer withdrawing at a point where the bank no longer can cover its deposits. So, people rush to the bank to withdraw their savings, which actually causes the bank to fail, which otherwise it wouldn’t. Likewise, Wolfers suggested that there actually wasn’t a toilet paper shortage. It’s true that people were staying home. So, they were using six packs of Charmin, instead of the big jumbo rolls in their workplace. But Kimberly-Clark quickly stepped up production to meet the demand, but somehow people just know that in an emergency, people hoard toilet paper, which can cause the very shortage that leads people to hoard toilet paper. So, they did hoard toilet paper. A lot of retailers then posted signs, max three rolls per customer. ADI IGNATIUS: That reinforced it. STEVEN PINKER: And that ended the shortage. Not so much because people didn’t strip the shelves because they couldn’t, but they were reassured that since no one else could buy more than three rolls, there was no reason for them to panic. Again, getting back to common knowledge, how did this originate? At least according to one history, it all started with another common knowledge generator, the Tonight Show, which back in the three network era, Johnny Carson was the king of late night. He had not only a huge audience, but people knew that people were watching Johnny Carson, which is why catchphrases from the show like, “Here’s Johnny,” everyone recognized it. So, one night, I think it was 1973, he said, “There’ve been all kinds of shortages lately.” This was an era where there were lines to get gasoline because of the Arab oil embargo and there was a meat shortage and a coffee shortage. He said, “Have you heard the latest? I read it in the papers. There’s a shortage of toilet paper.” Now it turned out it wasn’t true at the time. There was no shortage of toilet paper, but then that created a shortage of toilet paper when everyone ran out to buy it. Since then, at least according to the story, it’s hard to proof, it’s just become conventional wisdom that toilet paper becomes scarce in an emergency. ADI IGNATIUS: All of this must be very valuable for people who are in negotiation, right? Because negotiation is always, “What is it that we both know, and what is it that only I know?” I mean that’s how you win. But yeah, talk about to what extent I know, you know… That’s the fundamental of the people who negotiate better probably understand this concept better. STEVEN PINKER: Yeah. So, negotiation is one of a number of kinds of games in the game theory sense, meaning my best option depends on what you do and vice versa. In any time in which there can be multiple equilibria, cases where everyone is better off if they both do something, but it isn’t preordained what they’ll do. So, the negotiation is what’s sometimes called a battle of the sexes is the technical term. It has nothing actually to do with the sexes, but it refers to a hypothetical couple where they like to spend time together. He would prefer that they go to the hockey game. She would prefer they go to the opera. They’d rather go to either than not do something together. The question is, which one do they go to? Both of them are equilibria. In the case of negotiation, let’s say a car salesman and a buyer. There’s a range of prices in which the salesman makes a profit and the customer pays what they’re willing to pay to get the car. But within that range, the highest the customer is willing to pay, the lowest the seller is willing to sell for, how do they decide? Obviously, the seller wants it as high as possible, the buyer wants it as low as possible. If either of them walks away from the deal, then they’re both worse off. So, how do they decide? So there are many predicaments in life like this where there are many ways of doing something, but both parties are better off if they can figure out some way to do it. In the case of a negotiation, it’s interesting. This is something pointed out many years ago by the political scientist, Thomas Shelley, who won a Nobel Prize for this and other work, that often a buyer and seller in order to find somewhere, anywhere to land on that the other guy will agree with, they’ll pick something like splitting the difference or a round number. He notes that the salesman, who announced that his rock bottom price for the car is $30,007.26, is pretty much pleading to be relieved of $7.26. It’s like, “Oh, come on.” So why a round number? I mean, what’s so special about a round number? What’s special is other people can think it’s special or can expect each other to recognize it as special. So, these points, focal points, sometimes called shelling points, points that pop out in the minds of both parties and that’s all they need to come to an agreement are often where negotiations end up. ADI IGNATIUS: When you talk about common knowledge, particularly some of the early references, it seems a different era than where we are now. Maybe this was never true, but people my age will look back and say, “Well, we used to agree on facts.” We probably didn’t altogether, but we did, right? As you say, there were only three networks that wasn’t this ubiquity of opinion and everything. Now we’re really in an era where they’re competing truths and I would assume competing common knowledges. Obviously, there’s various common knowledges between people and in relationships, but at a larger level, I guess my question is, is that eroding the common knowledge that enables social interaction, et cetera? Is that a concern for you? STEVEN PINKER: There is that fear, although as you say and I often point out that the best explanation for the good old days is a bad memory. There’s a lot of polarization in the ’60s too, riots and terrorist bombings and assassinations and so on. Duly not romanticizing the past, there does seem to be an increase in negative polarization that is not just that people disagree, but each thinks that the other is evil. It’s plausible that one of the contributors was the fragmentation of the media markets. So, that instead of everyone watching Walter Cronkite or Huntley and Brinkley, first with cable news, with Fox News, whose business model was to cultivate a highly partisan audience that wants to hear a certain spin on everything and with social media where the networks of posting and reposting and tweeting and retweeting and linking and relinking has been shown to take place within two or more closed networks with not much interaction between that there could be separate pools of common belief within each of these communities. Something that’s easier to happen when there isn’t one public signal, a Super Bowl, a Johnny Carson, a Walter Cronkite that everyone knows that everyone knows is aware of. ADI IGNATIUS: Okay, so anyway, so this concept of common knowledge existing in different ways in different forms of relationships. So, within a company, if an executive, if a leader wants to create a common knowledge that he or she imagines would be beneficial for the culture of the company, is there a playbook almost for how to create a positive common knowledge within this environment? STEVEN PINKER: Well, in general, common knowledge is generated by something that is conspicuous, public. So, face-to-face meetings can generate common knowledge in a way that, say, remote meetings don’t. That is when you’re in a room, you see everyone else, they see you, they know that they’re seeing each other and seeing the speaker or the leader. So, I think that’s one of the reasons that as with the Super Bowl, which is a broadcast version, but there is an important role for publicly conspicuous notices, sometimes pronouncements. Going back to the economy as a whole, the reason that statements from the Fed are scrutinized and poured over like rabbis parsing the Talmud is that anything that the chairman of the Fed says can create its own reality when people knowing that other people have heard it will act on it out of anticipation of what other people will do, which can then feed on itself and create a bubble, a recession. So, I quote Alan Greenspan, who at one point said, “Since I’ve become chair of the Fed, I’ve learned to mumble with great incoherence. If I seem clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.” Because a signal that, say, a recession is ahead will create that recession because companies won’t hire out of fear that they’ll have to lay off employees. Consumers won’t buy out of fear that they might lose their jobs, each of which then creates the reality of the other. So, the chairman of that has to be very, very careful as to what she or he says. ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah. What’s interesting in all of this… You talk about politics in some ways, you talk about authoritarian politics. I lived in China and I lived in Russia and you did have the phenomenon that you described, which is everybody knows that the regime is rotten, but nobody says it because you can’t be certain if you take the streets, there’s going to be anybody else with you, even though everybody knows. Then you understand why you have to control everything because the moment you loosen up anything, it allows for this possibility of communication and understanding. It is like that moment when Ceausescu fell in Romania and he’d controlled everything. Suddenly, there’s people shouting in the back as he’s giving a speech and some stuff’s happening. He realizes it’s over because it’s either complete control or no control. STEVEN PINKER: In particular, since no dictator can control every last member of the population, there just isn’t enough firepower. There aren’t enough informants. As I quote the character of Gandhi in the movie by that name ADI IGNATIUS: Ben Kingsley… STEVEN PINKER: Who at one point tells a British colonial officer, “In the end, you’ll leave because 100,000 Englishmen simply cannot control 350 million Indians if the Indians refuse to cooperate.” He could have said, “Refuse to coordinate or are unable to coordinate.” So people can overpower a regime if they all stand up at the same time, if they all storm the palace, if they all stop work. But how can they do it if each one is afraid that he’ll be the only one? If he stands up, he can be picked off or bundled off to prison. If everyone protests at the same time, then there’s the safety in numbers, but there’s safety in coordination. So, there has to be a way of generating the common knowledge. Now’s the time that we all stand up together. So, protest in a public square where everyone sees everyone else seeing everyone else can often do it, which is why dictators are often terrified of public protests. Or if there is a widely circulated magazine, TV show, radio show, which is why they clamp down on the media. ADI IGNATIUS: Talk about the blank paper. STEVEN PINKER: Oh yeah. So, there’s a joke from the Soviet Union about a man handing out leaflets in red square. Of course, the KGB arrest him. They bundle him off to police headquarters, only discover that the leaflets are blank sheets of paper, and they confront him. They demand, “What is the meaning of this?”, and he says, “What’s there to say? It’s so obvious.” So the point of the joke was he was generating common knowledge. He didn’t need to say anything because people already knew it, but they didn’t know that everyone else knew it. And in a case of life imitating a joke, Putin’s police force has arrested a number of people for carrying blank signs. ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah, well, I wonder if it was before. So, that in China where it’s very dangerous to protest and very dangerous to dissent publicly, after the mishandling of COVID, there were famously blank paper protests. STEVEN PINKER: Oh, interesting. ADI IGNATIUS: Possibly inspired by the original- STEVEN PINKER: Joke. ADI IGNATIUS: … Soviet joke. Yeah. So, the book is fascinating and you put your finger on common knowledge and how we know what we know and how we think about certain things and how we operate. What are we supposed to do with all that? STEVEN PINKER: Well, it’s hard to answer that question because I didn’t write it as a how-to book or as a manual or self-help. It’s a work in fundamental science and logic and philosophy with lots and lots of applications. How you work it out in a particular case often depends on the particular payoffs. What would happen if you fail to coordinate? What do you gain if you do coordinate? If there are multiple ways of coordinating, who gains, who loses? So there’s no single formula, but it is a lens with which to view the world simply because coordination is so ubiquitous in human affairs. Any corporation, any institution, any school, any relationship, any couple, any friendship, any family, these are all people trying to coordinate and they always have to coordinate with some signal of common knowledge. They often, in order to preserve the relationship, have to keep things out of common knowledge. So, all the phenomena of politeness, euphemism, innuendo, tact, pretending not to see the elephant in the room, beating around the bush, hypocrisy, genteel hypocrisy, all of those I consider to be cases where people privately know something, but there’s some reason to keep it out of common knowledge. The reason being something in common knowledge changes the relationship. Sometimes you don’t want to change the relationship or you don’t want to signal the wrong relationship. So, just to give a couple of examples, I mean the most common case of systematic hypocrisy is politeness. If you could pass the salt, that would be awesome. What? If you think about it, literally, it really doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. But could you pass the salt? Do you think you might pass the salt? Why do we go through those rituals? It’s because we don’t want to boss each other around. I don’t want to give you a command as if you’re the butler, assuming that we’re friends or for that matter, strangers. ADI IGNATIUS: So benign hypocrisy or some of these protocols, they may not be direct, they may not be honest, but they’re what we need to function. STEVEN PINKER: They’re what we need to preserve our relationships because our relationships are coordination games, which depend on common knowledge. Sometimes we don’t want to blow up a relationship. So, we avoid the common knowledge. ADI IGNATIUS:. Steven Pinker, thank you for being on IdeaCast. STEVEN PINKER: Thanks for having me.

Title: Ethereum price forecast: analysts reveal shocking targets after the $1.5B liquidation bloodbath
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/ethereum-price-forecast-analysts-reveal-shocking-targets-after-the-1-5b-liquidation-bloodbath/

Full Content:
Ethereum price plunged into a violent sell-off on Monday, wiping out many leveraged long positions and rattling traders. Ethereum’s price has, however, rebounded slightly, with CoinGecko showing ETH trading around $4,197, with a 24-hour range near $4,125–$4,220 at press time. On Monday, Ethereum (ETH) fell roughly 15% alongside other major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), triggering $1.5 billion in liquidations — the largest single event in six months. BIGGEST LIQUIDATION CASCADE EVER OVER $1B IN LONGS WIPED OUT IN A SINGLE HOUR THE REAL BLOODBATH 🩸 pic.twitter.com/3MPOw56O48 — AlΞx Wacy 🌐 (@wacy_time1) September 22, 2025 The sudden drop forced many leveraged long positions to close and pushed ETH toward a key psychological floor around $4,000. The price decline came even as institutional demand continued. BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF registered roughly $512 million of inflows during the same sell-off, underscoring a divide between retail pressure and institutional accumulation. Technically, the market looks fragile. ETH recently broke a symmetrical triangle, a move that gives a measured downside target near $3,560 if selling persists. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe has flagged the $3,550–$3,750 area as a likely support zone, and he noted that the 20-week EMA sits close to $3,685. I think that we'll see some more chop occur on $ETH. I don't know whether we'll dip as deep as $3,550-3,750, but I'm sure that we'll start to see: – 20-Week MA is getting closer. – Compression is building up –> Big move to occur at a later time. It's now down nearly 20% from… pic.twitter.com/MUvUEYY4Xv — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) September 23, 2025 Short-term resistance bands now cluster between about $4,220 and $4,360. Below that, traders are watching $4,120, $4,050 and the critical $4,000 level. A decisive break under those supports could accelerate the decline toward roughly $3,800. Conversely, a clean bounce and a decisive close above the 50-day EMA near $4,250 would improve the odds of a sustained recovery. A second technical pattern of concern is a descending triangle that formed after August’s peak near $4,956. That structure keeps $4,070 as a make-or-break pivot. If $4,070 holds, the path to a retest of $5,000 reopens; if it fails, downside to $3,800 becomes more likely. On the bullish side, a string of analysts and macro studies argue that today’s weakness could set the stage for aggressive gains. Ted Pillows applied the Global M2 Money Supply chart to Ethereum and suggested a scenario that lands ETH between $18,000 and $20,000 by 2026. Global M2 supply is now projecting $18,000-$20,000 ETH by cycle top. Even if $ETH pulls half of that, it'll trade above $10,000. I'm still long-term bullish on Ethereum and think that a sweep of the $4,000 liquidity zone could happen before reversal. pic.twitter.com/w6ZZl0OuPI — Ted (@TedPillows) September 21, 2025 Other market voices back more modest but still impressive rallies. Daan de Rover and Fundstrat’s Mark Newton highlight a $5,500 target, with Newton adding that ETH is unlikely to drop much below $4,000. Institutional commitments have reinforced that sentiment; combined flows from large managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity reached hundreds of millions, a dynamic many analysts say supports higher prices over time. In addition, Crypto GEMs point to Wyckoff Accumulation scenarios and chart setups that could take ETH toward $7,000 if a spring and test sequence holds. Michaël van de Poppe himself argues that compression is building and that dips around current levels represent attractive accumulation opportunities for long-term buyers. Key datapoints to monitor are liquidity below $4,000, ETF inflows, and whether the 50-day EMA around $4,250 is reclaimed. Ethereum sits at a crossroads. The near term is binary: hold above $4,000 and bulls can chase higher targets; lose that floor and technical setups point to a deeper correction toward the mid-$3,000s. Longer term, robust institutional flows, tokenisation trends, and macro easing provide clear bullish arguments — some analysts even see five-figure and double-digit-thousand outcomes on the horizon.

Title: BlackRock raking in $260M in annual revenue from Bitcoin, Ether ETFs

Title: Thinking Small Drives Big Leaps In AI

ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. AI is an increasingly popular topic in the investment industry – for good reason. From its ability (or lack thereof) to facilitate investment research or pick winning stocks, the potential applications are broad. Like it or not, it’s clear that AI is going to change the investment industry in a big way. It started, mostly with hype, years ago, but there is more and more progress with each passing day. Some of the largest asset managers have already incorporated AI into their active ETFs. BlackRock (BLK), the largest asset manager in the world, provides an early case study. BlackRock first integrated AI/machine learning into active ETFs back in 2018 with the suite of ETFs under the “iShares Evolved” brand. This product line consisted of seven new funds which would pick holdings in industries based on machine learning and natural language processing. While the concept seemed promising, the results were not. Five of the seven funds were liquidated in 2022. Of the remaining 2 ETFs, only one has outperformed the S&P 500 since inception. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the outperforming ETF, now named iShares U.S. Tech Independence Focused ETF (IETC), focused on the high-flying tech sector. Why the lack of success? AI doesn’t perform well if it is fed poor training data. Whenever AI is involved, especially in a complex field like investing, the quality of the training data is the single most important factor to its success. Keep in mind that AI learns from its training data. It doesn’t know if its training data is wrong. It trusts it blindly. Unfortunately for users, current large language models (LLMs) fail miserably at understanding the meaning and nuances of financial data in filings because it has been trained using low quality financial data. Any stock picking or investment research system built on these models is using bad data, and everyone knows the timeless saying about models: garbage in – garbage out. If the financial models used to train the AI can’t generate alpha, AI isn’t going to do any better. AI isn’t a magic bullet. It cannot fix the data on which it is built. It’s a tool to replicate the work that human analysts do, but at scale. In fact, AI may perform worse than humans because it doesn’t have access to additional data on which its human counterparts rely on without realizing it. If big asset managers like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton (BEN), Invesco (IVZ), and others can’t find high-quality data to drive their AI solutions, I believe their stocks will face downward pressure. The only way for asset managers to differentiate their funds and hope to outperform the market more consistently is to leverage superior data to drive superior research. Otherwise, their only real differentiator is distribution, an advantage that has long been exhausted. There’s no better proof that the quality of training data is paramount to AI’s success than the mounting evidence that small language models (SLM) significantly outperform LLMs. The problem with LLMs is that they tend to rely heavily on the open internet for training, which is a data source filled with noise and inaccuracies. Traditional asset managers would never train human analysts by directing them to learn about investing by only reading the internet. Why anyone is training their AI analysts this way is unclear. As a result, these LLMs handle a broad range of general tasks reasonably well, but their performance declines sharply when faced with more sophisticated tasks. In contrast, SLMs focus on a narrower and more specific domain, which enables human experts to ensure the data is accurate and properly organized and that the rules about how to use the data produce reliable results. For example, the SLM created by New Constructs powers market-beating stock picking. I’m able to empirically prove the accuracy and reliability of the SLM because it is based on: I think the advantages of SLMs over LLMs are intuitive. Rather than trying to boil the ocean like LLMs, they narrow the scope to a small enough domain where human experts can truly curate a pristine dataset on which clear instructions can be built to produce truly reliable and human-expert level insights. See Figure 1, from this tweet, for a basic comparison of SLMs and LLMs. Figure 1: Comparing Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs)

Title: MRVL Stock vs. NVIDIA

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Marvell Technology stock recently jumped 12% in a single week, driven by growing optimism about its custom AI accelerators and optical sensitivity chips. This performance raises a key question for investors: how does Marvell now compare to its peer, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA)? NVIDIA presents superior revenue growth in key periods, enhanced profitability, and a comparatively lower valuation compared to Marvell Technology, indicating that investing in NVDA may be more advantageous. See how Marvell’s financials compare with its peers, including NVIDIA. MRVL designs and markets analog, mixed-signal, digital, and embedded integrated circuits, providing Ethernet solutions and storage controllers for HDDs and SSDs that support multiple system interfaces. NVDA supplies graphics, computing, and networking solutions for gaming, visualization, data centers, and automotive sectors, alongside a strategic partnership with Kroger Co. See further revenue details: See further margin details: However, do these figures provide the entire picture? Read Buy or Sell NVDA Stock to determine if NVIDIA’s advantage is sustainable or if Marvell Technology still has strategies to deploy (see Buy or Sell MRVL Stock). This is one perspective on evaluating stocks. If you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Regardless of how appealing the numbers are, stock investing is never without its bumps. There’s risk involved that must be considered. Read NVDA Dip Buyer Analyses and MRVL Dip Buyer Analyses to see how these stocks experienced declines and recoveries in past occurrences. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: JPMorgan To Appear At Ripple Swell: What We Know So Far
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/jpmorgan-ripple-swell/
Time Published: 2025-09-23T14:00:11Z
Full Content:
The XRP community’s rumor mill just met hard evidence: Ripple’s official Swell speaker roster now lists Scott Lucas, Head of Markets Digital Assets at JP Morgan, among this year’s presenters. Swell 2025 will take place in New York City on November 4–5 (welcome reception on November 3) at Convene Hudson Yards, with Ripple billing it as its ninth annual gathering of “leaders in crypto, blockchain, payments and policy.” JPMorgan’s appearance is part of a broader Wall Street tilt to the agenda. The same speakers page shows Maxwell Stein (Director, Digital Assets, BlackRock), Ryan Rugg (Global Head of Digital Assets, Treasury & Trade Solutions, Citi), Cynthia Lo Bessette (Head of Fidelity Digital Asset Management, Fidelity), and Kim Hochfeld (Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash, Digital & Securities Lending, State Street Investment Management). The published agenda assigns Stein to a capital-markets tokenization discussion with Moody’s, and pairs Rugg and Lo Bessette on a panel about how global banks are shaping digital assets at scale. As of publication, Lucas’s specific session was not listed on the agenda. Lineups are subject to change, but the current program underlines heavyweight TradFi participation. The listing triggered predictable chatter on X. James Rule XRP (@RuleXRP) amplified the update with: “Now JPMorgan is going to be at Ripple Swell? 🍿” Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) went further, asserting: “JPMorgan put their Head of Digital Assets on stage at Ripple Swell 2025. XRP is fully integrated into the banking infrastructure … adoption is inevitable.” Those are community interpretations, not confirmations of product integrations or partnerships; the only verifiable fact at this point is Lucas’s inclusion on Ripple’s official speaker slate. Lucas’s remit at JP Morgan is directly relevant to what Swell typically explores. He oversees the strategy and execution of new trading products built on DLT/blockchain and represents the bank in industry initiatives; he also holds board roles at HQLAx and Ownera, and serves on the board of CLS Group—all touchpoints in the market plumbing of tokenized collateral, securities finance and post-trade. Context matters: JPMorgan has built one of the industry’s most advanced permissioned-blockchain stacks for wholesale finance. Its Onyx (now Kinexys Digital Assets) platforms span JPM Coin and tokenized-collateral rails used in repo and liquidity operations; recent milestones include tokenized MMF collateral and on-chain intraday repo workflows. That program has processed large volumes and is expanding to third-party apps—developments that dovetail with Swell’s tokenization and market-infrastructure themes. None of this implies an XRP integration; it does explain why a senior JP Morgan digital-assets executive belongs in the conversation Swell curates. What to watch from here is straightforward. First, Swell’s New York program already confirms BlackRock’s tokenization talk and a joint Citi–Fidelity panel on bank adoption—useful signaling about where institutional priorities sit in late 2025. Second, keep an eye on the agenda for a named session involving JPMorgan’s Lucas; as of now, only his speaker listing is public. At press time, XRP traded at $2.86.

Title: Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs (Gen 1): Do you need to upgrade your smart glasses?

Meta brought the smarts of Oakley Meta HSTN to Ray-Ban styles. Here's what's new compared to the first-gen pair. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Same looks, new features Higher-quality 3K video recording and double the battery life highlight the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 upgrades over the original model. It's available in the same Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler styles and prescription lenses are available within the supported range. A classic with limits Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) was the breakthrough follow-up to Ray-Ban Stories, and it has sold millions. There's a reason for that — these are great smart glasses, but they also come with notable limitations, including battery life and camera quality. Ray-Ban Meta became the first product to make smart glasses mainstream, selling over two million units since their debut in 2023. Now, Meta is here with a second-generation version of the three iconic Ray-Ban smart glasses styles, packing revamped hardware. The recent Oakley Meta HSTN launch brought extra battery life and crisper video recording to Meta smart glasses, and now those advancements are headed to Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2. Meta is continuing to sell the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 at a lower price than the Gen 2 smart glasses, creating an interesting dilemma for interested buyers. Should owners of the Gen 1 smart glasses upgrade to the Gen 2 revision, and should new buyers pay more for the extra features? Those are the questions we'll help you answer in this comparison between Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2. Let's dive in. Why you can trust Android Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. Meta revealed the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 smart glasses at Connect 2025. They are available now online and at partner retailers for $379. They're sold in the same Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner styles as the first-generation smart glasses, but there are a few limited-edition colorways for early adopters. The same range of prescription lenses is supported, too, with prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00 being compatible. The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses are sticking around at a $299 price point, but some styles are out of stock. Skyler and Wayfarer styles appear to be available, although it's unclear for how long or if stock will be replenished. You can equip them with prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00, just like Gen 2. For those with advanced prescription needs, there are third-party workarounds available. Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 are identical to the first-generation pair of smart glasses from a design standpoint. You can choose between Wayfarer, Skyler, or Headliner styles depending on which you prefer, but these frames will look virtually identical across the Gen 1 and Gen 2 models. You get a camera on one side of the frames for photos and video recording, plus an LED indicator light on the opposite side to let others know when you're capturing content. The big change to the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2's design and dimensions is that Meta managed to shave a few grams of weight off the frames. The new pair of smart glasses weighs 48 grams, down from 52 grams on the Gen 1 model. I had comfort issues with Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 at times, partially due to the weight, which caused the glasses to slip down the bridge of my nose at times. I don't know whether the four-gram difference in weight will make the Gen 2 noticeably more comfortable, but I don't think it can hurt either. Category Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) Styles Wayfarer, Headliner, Skyler Wayfarer, Skyler, Headliner (out of stock) Lenses Polarized, Transitions, prescription (-6.0 to +4.0) Polarized, Transitions, prescription (-6.0 to +4.0) Camera 12MP Ultra-Wide 12MP Ultra-Wide Photo resolution 3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only) 3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait default) Video resolution 1200p at 60FPS 1440p at 30FPS 3K at 30FPS 1440 x 1920 pixels at 30 fps (Vertical default) Speakers 2X open ear speakers 2X open ear speakers Microphones Custom 5-mic Array (2 in left arm, 2 in right arm, 1 near nose pad) Custom 5-mic Array (2 in left arm, 2 in right arm, 1 near nose pad) Storage 32GB; about 500 photos, 100 30-second videos 32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 500+ photos (3 frame burst) Connectivity Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3 Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3 Compatibility iOS; Android iOS; Android Weight 52g 49.2g Durability IPX4 IPX4 Battery Up to 8 hours per charge 5 hours continuous audio playback or voice calling 4 hours per charge: 30 minutes live streaming Charging (glasses) case 48 hours worth of charge Up to 32 hours Charging speed 50% in 20 minutes 50% in 20 minutes Both the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses offer a 12MP ultra-wide camera, with support for 3024 X 4032 resolution photos. However, the video-recording capabilities of the Gen 2 pair are vastly superior to the Gen 1 model. You get 1200p at 60FPS, 1440p at 30FPS, and 3K at 30FPS video recording on the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, and that exceeds the 1080p maximum on the Gen 1 glasses. It's the same 3K camera we saw on Oakley Meta HSTN, which should bring more advanced stabilization while recording video, particularly handy for action shots. Hyperlapse and slow-motion video recording is heading to Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 in a future software update this fall, according to Meta. Whether you need the extra resolution and video recording features will depend on whether you're satisfied with your current Gen 1 pair. Those who love recording video while running or working out will likely benefit from the extra frame rate support and stabilization of the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 camera. Both the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses have open-air speakers for video calls, audio playback, and more. There's also built-in microphones for audio input. Battery life was the most obvious place for Meta to upgrade its Ray-Ban smart glasses, and the second-generation model doesn't disappoint in this area. Just like the Meta Oakley HSTN smart glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses can last up to eight hours on a single charge. That's double the four-hour battery life of the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses. In the real world, that means you can take more photos, record more videos, and listen to more audio without needing to pop the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 into their charging case. In fact, the new model nets you five hours of continuous audio playback or voice calling. Both the Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses can charge up to 50% in 20 minutes in a pinch. You charge both pairs of smart glasses by popping them into an included charging case, which has its own internal battery and a USB-C port. The case is also used for pairing with the Meta AI companion app and has a button for connections and resets. Meta AI is becoming more robust, supporting voice assistance and camera inputs. Essentially, it's a multimodal AI service that can take in audio plus your surroundings to help answer questions and take actions on your behalf. Both generations of Ray-Ban Meta support Meta AI, but there are extra features on the Gen 2 revision, like better live translation support. The ability for offline translation is also said to be coming in a future update. If you're in the market for a new pair of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, the choice is easy. The second-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses clear the originals in weight, camera quality, and battery life — all key areas. As such, paying the extra $80 for the Gen 2 is a no-brainer when you consider all the quality-of-life upgrades you'll get. You should consider whether Ray-Ban Meta Display, Oakley Meta HSTN, or Oakley Meta Vanguard might suit you better if you have specialized use cases, like the need for a display or fitness-focused glasses. However, those with the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses shouldn't feel the pressure to upgrade immediately. If the camera quality and battery life are meeting your expectations, hold onto them. The experience between models is largely the same, you'll just need to charge your Gen 1 pair more frequently. The one to buy Meta addressed the major drawbacks of Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 with the second-generation revision, and they only cost a bit more. For that extra cash, you get excellent 3K video with better stabilization and double the battery life of the original. It's a no-brainer for people in the market for new smart glasses.

Departments, agencies and public bodies News stories, speeches, letters and notices Detailed guidance, regulations and rules Reports, analysis and official statistics Consultations and strategy Data, Freedom of Information releases and corporate reports Chancellor Rachel Reeves will declare the UK ‘open for business’, following a £110 billion investment surge from major financial services firms in the past week alone. Global fintech leader Revolut will today (23 September) open its new global headquarters in Canary Wharf, setting out plans to invest £3 billion in the UK and create 1,000 high-skilled jobs over the next five years. This comes on the heels of last week’s £100 billion investment from asset manager Blackstone, £7 billion from BlackRock and £1.25 billion in inward investment from leading US financial firms including PayPal and Bank of America - generating 1,800 new jobs in major cities including London, Edinburgh, Belfast, and Manchester. The wave of investment from financial services companies comes just months after the Chancellor cut needless financial red tape to ensure the UK wins the global race for financial services investment as part of the modern industrial strategy. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said: The UK is well and truly open for business under this government. Through our Leeds Reforms we’re making Britain the best place for financial services companies to do business, pushing us ahead in the global race for investment and putting more money in people’s pockets through the Plan for Change. Nik Storonsky, CEO and Co-founder of Revolut, commented: Our mission has always been to simplify money for our customers, and our vision to become the world’s first truly global bank is the ultimate expression of that. From our roots here in the UK, we’ve grown to serve over 65 million customers globally, and today’s opening of our new Global HQ in London is the launchpad for our future. This HQ will be central to driving our growth towards our next milestone of 100 million customers. To power that journey from our home market, we are investing £3 billion in the UK over the next five years. This commitment will not only create 1,000 new jobs but will also fuel the innovation from our London hub that will help us deliver on our global ambitions. The major investments from financial services firms over the past week include: These investments in the UK are a vote of confidence in the UK’s economic plan, built on stability, investment and reform. The Leeds Reforms set out the widest ranging reforms to financial regulation in over a decade, making the UK more attractive to global financial services firms. This includes new support for fintech introducing tailored support to help FinTechs, with new start-ups getting a single regulatory point of contact to help them through the scale-up phase. The contact will be able to provide technical support to help them understand the regulatory requirements they need to meet in order to grow. Revolut’s investment marks its commitment to the UK, where it has grown to become a global fintech leader with more than 10,000 employees and revenues of over £3 billion. The company now serves over 65 million customers worldwide, including 12 million in the UK, and has set its sights on reaching 100 million customers globally by mid 2027. Revolut’s success exemplifies the strength of the UK’s fintech sector, which boasts around 3,000 firms supporting tens of thousands of skilled jobs nationwide.

Vardoulakis A blockchain is a distributed database where independent computers across the world maintain identical copies of a transaction record, updating it only when the network reaches consensus on new transactions—making the history transparent and extraordinarily difficult to alter. Historically, bonds have traded almost entirely in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, while equities and money market fund shares have largely settled through centralized infrastructures such as stock exchanges and central securities depositories. In both settings, each institution maintains its own records, and post-trade steps like confirmation, clearing, and settlement require multiple intermediaries and repeated reconciliation. Blockchain offers a different model: instead of fragmented books or a single central authority, all participants share a single, consensus-validated ledger of ownership and transactions. A tokenized asset—whether a bond, equity, or money market fund share—is a digital representation of that claim on the blockchain, with transfers recorded as direct updates to this shared ledger. While distributed ledgers are not inherently faster or cheaper than centralized systems, they differ in important ways: no single entity controls the record; programmable logic can automate corporate actions or enforce transfer restrictions; and auditability is native through an append-only history. In this way, blockchain replaces bilateral and centrally governed recordkeeping with a common ledger that is jointly maintained and verifiable in real time. While many types of assets have been tokenized to date, we focus on the tokenization of “money-like” investment funds that potentially allow for novel use cases. We provide a background of how these products have evolved and discuss their use cases. In a subsequent post, we examine the benefits and risks to financial stability from these products. Many types of assets have been tokenized to date, including real estate, commodities, agriculture, and other financial securities. But the bulk of tokenization activity in the United States has concentrated on two types of funds: money market funds (MMFs), which are open-end funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act), and private funds that are exempt from registration under that Act. Several private funds have been proposed by large financial institutions, suggesting surging interest among market participants and the possibility of wider adoption. Private funds are exempt from many of the requirements in federal securities laws and regulations applicable to MMFs, including the 1940 Act’s disclosure requirements for investment companies. As a result, regulators and the public have little visibility into their operations, including whether they have instituted the same type of liquidity risk management tools as MMFs are required to implement (for example, portfolio maturity maximums and liquid asset minimums). Three prominent tokenized MMFs are Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX (AUM $708M), Circle/Hashnote’s USYC ($488M) and WisdomTree’s WTGXX ($10.8M); the largest tokenized private fund is BlackRock’s BUIDL (AUM $2.5B). The chart below shows the growth of these four tokenized funds. Total Assets Under Management of Select Tokenized Funds Three prominent use cases of tokenized funds have been developed to date, all of which are novel as they have historically not been available to investment funds due to numerous legal, regulatory, and/or market reasons. See, for example, “Lessons from the History of the U.S. Regulatory Perimeter” for how the legal perimeter has evolved in the United States, separating deposit liabilities, which are considered legal payment instruments, from other types such as investment funds’ liabilities, which are not. Use Case I: Development of a Secondary Market and Instantaneous Liquidity Pools Investors may want to hold tokenized shares beyond their traditional function as a store of value. For example, tokenization allows shares to circulate as a medium of exchange in secondary markets. Such a possibility would be facilitated by innovative efforts to offer immediate liquidity against tokenized shares. For instance, some fund issuers have established processes by which their tokenized shares can be exchanged for more widely used means of digital-asset payments, namely stablecoins. A prominent example is the smart-contract-controlled pool where BUIDL and FOBXX are instantaneously exchangeable for USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin by market capitalization. These initiatives enable a deeper integration of tokenized funds with the digital-asset ecosystem, thereby increasing benefits to investors of tokenized funds, as they can use their shares to transact in ways historically unavailable to such shares. Use Case II: Reserve Asset for DeFi-based Products Tokenization can also facilitate the use of the shares to be used as a store of value in the digital-asset ecosystem. For example, at least three DeFi-based products use BUIDL as a reserve asset. One such product is Ondo Finance’s “Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries” (OUSG). Recently, Ondo announced it would exchange shares of OUSG for shares in four tokenized MMFs (FOBXX, WTGXX, and two international funds). Ondo plans to then hold the acquired shares as part of OUSG’s reserve assets which are predominantly made up of BUIDL. In essence, OUSG serves as an example of the secondary market functionality discussed above with an increased role for tokenized shares to be a store of value in the digital-asset ecosystem, while also providing additional liquidity for token holders given the 24/7 on-off ramp in which tokenized funds can be indirectly exchanged for stablecoins. While Ondo could have used stablecoins as collateral directly, this would have been less attractive as a store of value since stablecoins do not pay interest. In addition, both Mountain Protocol’s stablecoin and the rebranded FRAX stablecoin claim that BUIDL comprises a portion of their reserve assets. Use Case III: Collateral for Derivatives A third use case for tokenized shares is posting margins for repurchase agreements and derivatives transactions. Bloomberg reports that two of the world’s largest crypto prime brokers allow clients, including hedge funds, to use BlackRock’s BUIDL as collateral for crypto-based derivatives trading and are in early talks with some of the world’s largest crypto exchanges to expand this offering. Moreover, Circle recently purchased Hashnote, the issuer of the world’s largest tokenized MMF to “emerge as a preferred form of yield-bearing collateral on crypto exchanges, and also with custodians and prime brokers.” Meanwhile, in traditional derivatives, JPMorgan Chase facilitated a transaction in which tokenized BlackRock MMF shares were pledged as collateral with Barclays for a derivatives contract, although there haven’t been any additional transactions to date. It is too early to tell what impact, if any, tokenized shares will have on the financial system. Thus far tokenized shares have been mainly facilitating use cases within the digital-asset ecosystem. While there exists a lot of opacity in how these tokenized funds are being used as well as limited evidence of broader acceptance so far, interconnections between the traditional financial system and digital assets could increase if these products are used more broadly by market participants in the future.

The feature was enabled through a smart contract, which now serves as another off-ramp for products offered by asset managers BlackRock and VanEck, according to a press release. It functions 24/7, allowing users to access instant liquidity, Ripple added. Ripple’s stablecoin debuted in December. And although it’s much smaller than alternatives offered by Tether and Circle, RLUSD has grown to a market capitalization of $740 million within the past year, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. In a statement, Jack McDonald, senior vice president of stablecoins at Ripple, described the move as a “natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto,” noting that RLUSD was designed specifically for institutional use. Securitize made a similar announcement nearly a year ago, saying that Circle’s USDC had been integrated into its platform as a way to reduce investment costs and streamline the subscription process for investing in BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). BlackRock’s BUDIL is worth $2 billion, according to data from RWA.xyz. Around 90 qualified investors hold shares in the fund, which is tokenized on several blockchains, including Solana, Avalanche, Ethereum, Polygon, and layer-2 networks Arbitrum and Optimism. The VanEck Treasury Fund (VBILL), which can also be exchanged for RLUSD on Securitize’s platform, is worth $74 million, while only having 14 different holders. Shares in BUIDL and VBILL are represented by tokens that change hands at $1, but unlike most stablecoins, they offer investors a yield. Products issued through Securitize’s platform do not yet exist on XRP Ledger, but Tuesday’s announcement notes that “additional use cases and assets [are] planned,” while Securitize will “expand access and bring new utility to the XRPL ecosystem” through its own moves. On Monday, Ripple unveiled an updated roadmap for XRPL, highlighting new compliance features like the ability for token issuers to “deep freeze” wallet addresses and a method for being able to “dry run” transactions. “Partnering with Ripple to integrate RLUSD into our tokenization infrastructure is a major step forward in automating liquidity for tokenized assets,” Securitize CEO and co-founder Carlos Domingo said in a statement. “Together, we’re delivering real-time settlement and programmable liquidity across a new class of compliant, on-chain investment products.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Snowflake-led coalition targets data fragmentation with vendor-neutral semantic standard
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/09/23/snowflake-led-coalition-targets-data-fragmentation-vendor-neutral-semantic-standard/
Time Published: 2025-09-23T13:00:22Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 09:00 EDT / SEPTEMBER 23 2025 by Paul Gillin Snowflake Inc. and a group of partners today launched the Open Semantic Interchange initiative, an open-source effort to standardize how organizations define and share business semantics across data and analytics platforms. The initiative aims to create a vendor-neutral specification for business metrics, dimensions and metadata that can be used consistently across business intelligence tools, data catalogs and artificial intelligence applications. The 17 initial participants include Salesforce, BlackRock Inc. and dbt Labs Inc. Data semantics describe the meaning and context of data relative to business concepts, processes and rules. For example, consistent semantics ensure that different systems and teams interpret terms like “customer,” “revenue” and “operating margin” the same way. Many organizations manage business metrics across multiple BI and analytics systems, each with its own set of semantic definitions. That leads to duplication of effort and inconsistent definitions. The initiative is an effort to resolve those differences. “A strong request from customers has been to make semantic models interoperable,” said Josh Klahr, director of analytics product management at Snowflake. “They want to make it easy for a model in one place to show up in another location, avoid the risk of vendor lock-in and think about interoperability for the long term.” The effort will initially focus on analytics and BI use cases with an additional emphasis on enabling AI interfaces to work with consistent, verified data definitions. Work on the specification has just begun, with a working group defining the first version of a draft standard that’s likely to be published within the next few months, Klahr said. Numerous technology- and industry-specific semantic standards already exist, with several administered by the World Wide Web Consortium. The standard is expected to build on existing approaches where possible, using widely adopted formats such as YAML to define metrics, hierarchies and relationships. “YAML will likely end up being the definition language,” Klahr said. Snowflake said the initiative will probably be donated to either the Apache Software Foundation or the Linux Foundation. “It’s early to say which because we want the working group to agree on what the licensing model will be,” Klahr said, “but the plan is to be an open-source project.” The company expects the list of participating vendors to grow rapidly. “There’s lots of interest,” Klahr said. “This is something that makes sense to everybody.” Snowflake rival Databricks Inc. isn’t a founding member, but “I would love for additional partners like Databricks to be part of the effort as well,” he said.

Title: From Goldman To AI: How Rishi Bali Is Building Wall Street’s Transformation Layer With OPCO.AI

BySindhya Valloppillil, Contributor. Finance runs on spreadsheets. OPCO.AI thinks that’s a $1 trillion risk. Wall Street’s next alpha isn’t in trading — it’s in AI infrastructure. If and when the credit cycle tightens, the dominoes don’t ask permission: one missed covenant, one delayed NAV, one reconciliation error in an inbox. Private markets still run too much on PDFs and spreadsheets; in a storm, that’s a fault line.. One firm betting that alpha now depends as much on the pipes as on the trade is OPCO.AI—founded by Goldman veteran Rishi Bali. OPCO.AI describes itself as Wall Street’s transformation layer — a builder that fuses risk, operations, and technology into a single, AI-powered operating core. After three decades building the machinery of modern finance — from Goldman’s credit desks and derivatives prime brokerage to multi-strategy hedge funds and private platforms — Bali is betting the edge in the next era won’t come from squeezing another basis point out of trades, but from sealing the basis points that leak out of broken workflows. Private Equity & Private Credit. The buyout playbook thrived on cheap leverage. Then rates spiked to decade highs. Banks, constrained by post-GFC rules, stepped back from riskier lending, and private equity stepped in. Private credit — once niche — is now one of finance’s fastest-growing corners, fueled by deep insurance capital (think Apollo/Athene, KKR/Global Atlantic). But while capital has institutionalized, the operating infrastructure hasn’t. Covenants and borrowing bases live in PDFs. Amendments move through email. Risk engines are patchy; finance systems creak; investor reporting lags. In a benign cycle, those gaps stay hidden. Under stress, they become systemic weaknesses. Growth-stage VC and crossover funds increasingly resemble PE in their structures and scale — and they too face rising expectations from institutional LPs for faster reporting, stronger controls, and more resilient infrastructure. Industry outlooks peg private markets at roughly $13 trillion today on a path toward $20 trillion by 2030, and fundraising in private credit has concentrated among experienced managers in the higher-rate era — a winner-take-most dynamic that raises the bar for operating maturity. The more immediate risk is toxic operations, not toxic assets—covenant data trapped in PDFs can be more dangerous than any single borrower. The systemic-risk debate here is well covered elsewhere (see recent WSJ interviews with Jamie Dimon and Sixth Street’s Alan Waxman, and FT coverage on opacity/retail exposure); this piece focuses on the operating spine rather than relitigating that debate. Counterpoint (brief): Not all agree private credit is systemic. FT has argued that fund lockups, hard redemption caps, and diversified lender bases blunt contagion risk. The operating burden still rises either way — especially on covenant data, valuations, and investor transparency. Hedge Funds. The two-and-twenty model faces a new math. Performance pressure in front; legacy systems in back. Many funds still run on 20-year-old risk/accounting stacks. Shadow accounting doubles effort; no-shadow outsourcing introduces fresh fragility. As complexity rises — from structured credit to CLO warehousing — manual reconciliations become existential. Allocators and regulators want near real-time views. Markets deliver macro, tariff, and geopolitical shocks on their own schedule. The result: sophistication at the strategy layer riding on creaky pipes underneath. Meanwhile, industry AUM has pushed to record territory — north of ~$4.5 trillion (HFR) — intensifying the need for industrial-grade controls and reporting. Recent fundraising barometers are widely covered (Bloomberg on Jain Global’s $5.3B debut; Bloomberg on D.E. Shaw’s human-run fund), underscoring a winner-take-most dynamic and closer scrutiny on infrastructure. In tight-spread markets, operational accuracy matters as much as strategy—the speed of reconciliation and provable lineage can outweigh another trading signal. Family Offices. Founder liquidity created a wave of family offices — and a governance gap. Too many run on ad hoc spreadsheets, basic custodial statements, or the wrong jurisdictional setups. The tools exist (Addepar/Mirador), but tools without institutional discipline don’t create controls. Moving from concentrated founder wealth to institutional portfolios requires operating rigor — policies, risk frameworks, and consolidated reporting — or concentration and operational risks compound quietly. Estimates for the number of family offices range widely — from ~8,000 to well over 10,000 globally — underscoring both growth and opacity in this segment. The reputational risk isn’t performance; it’s process opacity—allocators notice sloppy dashboards and inconsistent closes. Banks. Even with regulators watching, legacy cores and offshored processes have left surveillance, compliance, and trade-monitoring underinvested. For investment banks and capital markets players alike, financial governance and infrastructure modernization have become survival issues. Fines, model risk, and AI governance expectations have made “now or never” modernization unavoidable. Customers expect near real-time; fintechs set the bar; cyber risk expands with every integration. The U.S. shift to T+1 settlement compressed operational timelines further. Recent actions illustrate the cost of lagging controls: in 2024, U.S. regulators levied roughly $250 million (OCC) and $98.2 million (Federal Reserve) in penalties tied to surveillance deficiencies at a large U.S. bank; the CFTC added $200 million (with up to $100 million credit for overlapping issues). The choice is stark: pay later in penalties and reputation, or invest now in resilient operating backbones. Being “regulated” isn’t the same as being resilient; in 2025, model/AI governance is the new capital ratio. Bali’s conviction is that AI isn’t a bolt-on tool; it’s a new operating paradigm. OPCO.AI positions itself as building an Operations Intelligence Layer — a governed data spine that fuses risk, operations, and technology with explainable automation, clear lineage, and human-in-the-loop AI copilots. His vantage point was earned in the trenches: Goldman Sachs Rates & Credit in the late 1990s, helping stand up the firm’s credit infrastructure as the asset class grew from a sidecar to a core engine; launching derivatives prime brokerage to support multi-asset hedge funds; then senior roles at D.B. Zwirn, UBS Dillon Read, Alphadyne, and Citigroup Tribeca Global Management. He also built a Made-in-USA technical apparel brand with institutional capital — a founder’s lesson in execution and design that now shows up in OPCO.AI’s doctrine: design is a control. OPCO.AI is a builders’ shop, not a slide factory. Senior operators collapse risk, ops, and tech into a single source of truth, run pre‑mortems to contain blast radius, and treat design as a control. The team executes fast, hands the capability back, and measures success in hard outcomes: fewer exceptions, faster closes, cleaner audits, and basis points saved. At Goldman, Bali watched credit evolve from an offshoot of rates into a full asset class — investment grade, high yield, CDO/CLO warehousing, credit reinsurance — and helped architect the operating controls those desks needed to scale. Extending prime brokerage beyond equities into credit, rates, and FX required entirely new models of risk and reconciliation. Today, as private markets take on the scale and scrutiny once reserved for public markets, the operating burden has multiplied. OPCO.AI is his vehicle for applying that experience at buy-side scale. Every engagement starts with a one‑line brief — the sharpest statement of pain (e.g., “Covenant monitoring is broken,” “Month‑end takes 15 days,” “We have three versions of P&L”). From that single sentence, the team expands it into a working system the client owns: documented workflows, reconciliations, controls, and governance. Within ~60 days, a live data model and automated reconciliations establish provable lineage and seal the first cracks; by ~120 days, 60–80% of repetitive workflows are automated, exceptions are routed and tracked, investor reporting accelerates, and risk and finance speak to a single source of truth. The Target Operating Model is then institutionalized: the Current State is benchmarked, the Ideal State is defined (provable lineage, automated recs, consistent reporting, embedded controls), and a Future State path is laid out (agentic workflows, real‑time risk) aligned to mandate and culture. OPCO.AI hands back the capability with clean documentation and durable design, and measures success in hard outcomes: fewer breaks, faster closes, cleaner audits, and basis points saved. Discovery maps a fund’s operating DNA — beyond “the close is slow” to the root causes: lineage gaps, control breaks, and seams between risk, ops, and tech. From that mandate, the team designs toward the Target Operating Model and executes on two tracks at once: tactical fixes (automate the highest‑pain reconciliations, stabilize data feeds, standardize investor reporting) and strategic rebuild (a governed data spine that unifies risk/finance/ops with near‑real‑time NAV/P&L and designed workflows). Embedded throughout is Risk Diagnostics across three dimensions — efficiency, operational robustness, and regulatory resilience — which prioritize what to fix first, how to contain exceptions, and how to evidence compliance. The outcome is a solutions layer the client owns: harmonized with legacy, auditable by design, and ready for AI agents. The outcome is a Solutions Layer the client owns: harmonized with legacy, auditable by design, and ready for AI agents. Most finance UX feels like 1995. OPCO.AI builds cockpit-grade interfaces (Python/React) where clarity is a control. On the AI side, MCP acts like a USB port for agents across fragmented systems, with lineage preserved. The next frontier: agentic AI with DLT-based proof-of-human/intent, so every action is authenticated, authorized, and auditable. Consultants. The Big Four (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) dominate operations and risk consulting. Their strengths are clear: global scale, regulatory expertise, and armies of specialists who can handle audits, model validation, and remediation at size. The trade‑offs are equally well known: long timelines, junior‑heavy staffing pyramids, and deliverables that skew toward diagnostics and governance artifacts over shipped systems. Large programs can drift into “transformation theater,” where steering committees multiply but on‑desk change lags. Conflicts (audit vs. advisory) and complex RACI structures can also slow decisions, which matters when firms need working controls in weeks, not quarters. Fund Administrators. SS&C, Citco, State Street, Northern Trust, Apex and others provide NAV calculation, investor services, and regulatory filings at industrial scale. Their advantages: deep control frameworks, established SLAs, and familiarity with the dominant accounting stacks (e.g., Geneva, VPM). Limitations arise when administrators are asked to redesign front‑to‑back workflows: customization is constrained, change management is ticket‑driven, and integration across risk/ops/finance can be slow. The mandate is to keep accurate books, not to re‑architect operating models. As more managers experiment with “no‑shadow” setups, the quality of reconciliations, exception handling, and data lineage becomes a central dependency — and a potential bottleneck. Technology Platforms. Arcesium, SEI Novus, Allvue, BlackRock Aladdin, iCapital, and Addepar each offer powerful tools, but generally in siloed domains. Arcesium, spun out of D.E. Shaw, provides portfolio accounting and reconciliation systems. SEI Novus emphasizes analytics and manager intelligence for allocators. Allvue delivers fund accounting and investor reporting software to private capital managers. BlackRock’s Aladdin is the dominant risk and portfolio management platform for asset owners, but was designed primarily with the perspective of institutions like pension funds, not buy-side funds. iCapital has built a strong platform for alternative investment access and distribution, while Addepar focuses on consolidated reporting for family offices and wealth managers. Each of these platforms has become essential in its niche, yet most were not built to integrate seamlessly across the full workflow of private credit, hedge funds, and multi-strategy platforms. Niche AI/Data Startups. Players like Canoe Intelligence, FundGuard, Hazeltree, or 73 Strings focus on automating narrow slices of fund operations. Canoe specializes in extracting and structuring data from fund documents, FundGuard applies cloud-native tech to accounting and NAV oversight, Hazeltree handles treasury and liquidity management, and 73 Strings provides valuation and portfolio monitoring.Each addresses real pain points, but they operate as point solutions. Their limitation is that they rarely integrate across the full operating stack, leaving firms with improved pockets of efficiency but without an overarching infrastructure layer. Boutique Consultancies. Smaller shops exist, but they lack global reach and the institutional lineage of larger players. Their impact is often limited by scale. So what? The market is crowded with capable specialists — consultants for governance, administrators for books, platforms for slices of the workflow, and AI point‑solutions for specific tasks — but few offerings bridge them into a unified, governed operating spine. Managers that can prove real‑time lineage, faster closes, exception containment, and audit‑ready automation are the ones winning allocator trust — and, increasingly, capital. What could go wrong? Operational rewiring rarely ships on Gantt charts. Integrations sprawl, legacy data fights back, and AI systems raise governance questions — explainability, audit trails, and model drift. There’s vendor‑dependency risk, too: moving reconciliations and covenant parsing into a single layer concentrates failure unless controls are designed for containment. The bet here is that disciplined design, human‑in‑the‑loop workflows, and provable lineage can shrink that blast radius. Over the last decade, capital migrated: private credit exploded, hedge funds scaled, family offices multiplied, and even banks offshored in search of efficiency. But the pipes never caught up. The operating burden now looks like a bank’s — without bank-grade controls. Data lineage can’t be proven. Valuation governance lacks audit trails. Investor reporting takes weeks, not hours. The next stress may not come from asset blowups alone — but from operational failures in reconciliation, surveillance, and governance that magnify them. OPCO.AI’s wager is clear: if Wall Street is going to withstand its next test, it won’t be thanks to another clever trade. It will be because the infrastructure held — transforming operations into alpha.

Stock futures are little changed this morning after major indexes hit record highs for the third straight session yesterday; Nvidia (NVDA) shares are down slightly in premarket trading after surging following news of the company's $100 billion investment in OpenAI; Micron Technology (MU) is expected to report strong earnings when it releases its financials after markets close today; Boeing (BA) shares are rising after the aircraft manufacturer signed its biggest-ever single order; and the OECD projects U.S. GDP growth will remain resilient this year but will slow in 2026 as tariffs and lower immigration weigh on the economy. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are flat after major market indexes hit record highs for the third consecutive session yesterday. Investors will be following remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell today after the central bank last week made its first interest rate cut of the year. Futures tied to the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.1% in recent trading, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell fractionally. Gold futures hit another record high this morning, trading at around $3,820 an ounce. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was up slightly at around $113,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array loans, was at 4.12% recently, down from 4.15% at yesterday's close. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are in focus after the world’s most valuable company said yesterday it would invest up to $100 billion into ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Shares of Nvidia surged on the news yesterday, gaining close to 4%, while other chipmakers also moved higher. "This investment and infrastructure partnership mark the next leap forward—deploying 10 gigawatts to power the next era of intelligence," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a release. Nvidia said the first of those 10 gigawatts is expected to be deployed in the second half of next year. Nvidia shares were down about 1% in premarket trading. Memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU) is set to release its earnings report after markets close today. Analysts are expecting continued strong sales from the company as the Nvidia-partner has seen strong data center sales from AI-driven demand. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha expect Micron's adjusted earnings per share to more than double to $2.82, while quarterly revenue is estimated to have risen 43% from the year-ago quarter to $11.12 billion. The chipmaker’s stock hit a new record high last week amid bullish analyst sentiment over the company’s AI exposure. Shares of Micron were up more than 1% ahead of the opening bell. Shares of Boeing (BA) are moving higher this morning after the company announced its single largest order in history. Boeing will sell up to 22 787 Dreamliners to Uzbekistan Airways, which the company said will support 35,000 jobs. In a Truth Social post, President Donald Trump said the deal was worth over $8 billion deal and came after he spoke with Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev earlier this month. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. and China are in the final stages of negotiations on a large order for Boeing aircraft. Boeing’s second-quarter deliveries shot past analysts' estimates as the plane maker continues its turnaround under a new CEO. Shares of Boeing, which through Monday's close had gained 20% so far this year, were up more than 2% in premarket trading. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Tuesday raised its growth forecast for the U.S. economy in 2025 on the back of AI investments, but noted that tariffs and lower net immigration would lead to slowing growth next year. The OECD said it expects the U.S.'s annual real GDP growth rate to come in at 1.8% in 2025, up from from its previous projection of 1.6%. However, U.S. GDP is projected to grow by just 1.5% next year. "Strong AI-related investment boosted outcomes in the United States," the Paris-based body said, but also noted that GDP growth is falling from 2024 as "strong investment growth in high technology sectors is more than offset by higher tariff rates and a drop in net immigration."

Title: Exclusive: Fast-growing crypto and stablecoin startup Zerohash raises $104 million
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/09/23/zerohash-edward-woodford-fundraise-interactive-brokers-morgan-stanley/
Time Published: 2025-09-23T11:45:11Z
Full Content:
Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. A recent flood of institutional demand for blockchain technology has helped to mint a new unicorn. Zerohash, a crypto and stablecoin infrastructure company headquartered in Chicago, announced Tuesday that it had raised $104 million at a $1 billion valuation. Interactive Brokers, a publicly traded brokerage, led the round. In a crowded field of infrastructure companies, Zerohash has carved out a name for itself by helping financial institutions and fintechs build out their own products for stablecoins, crypto trading, and tokenization. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies backed by underlying assets like the U.S. dollar, and tokenization refers to putting financial assets into blockchain wrappers. Other participants in the startup’s fundraise included traditional finance giants like Morgan Stanley and Apollo Global Management. The publicly traded fintech SoFi and the crypto arm of the high-frequency trading firm Jump Trading also contributed, among others. The $1 billion valuation marks a significant jump from Zerohash’s last round in 2022, when it raised at a $340 million valuation, according to Pitchbook. The data aggregator’s estimate is “about accurate,” said Edward Woodford, founder and CEO of Zerohash, but he declined to specify his company’s valuation in its prior fundraise. The near tripling in Zerohash’s worth signals how crypto, which contracted from 2022 to 2024, is now riding another wave of hype. And the traditional finance institutions backing the startup are evidence of how Wall Street investors, not just a ragtag group of cypherpunk libertarians, are driving the market’s recent surge. “Crypto now is not a debated issue at this point at large institutional banks,” said Woodford. Although Woodford has been in crypto for almost a decade, he’s no cypherpunk. In 2015, he graduated from MIT with a master’s degree in finance and launched a swaps platform for emerging commodities, like industrial hemp. He sold the business in 2017 to the brokerage Tastytrade, and, that same year, Woodford went on to build a new company. That business has cycled through a variety of names and stylizations—Seed CX, Zero #, Zero Hash, and now Zerohash—but it’s always focused on building crypto infrastructure for financial institutions. Over eight years, Woodford has managed to ride multiple crypto booms and busts. “It’s not just that we’re a survivor,” he said. “We’ve actually thrived in that market, and actually now, I think we can accelerate that even further.” But it’s this cycle of crypto, where every Wall Street firm appears to be piling into digital assets amid pro–crypto regulation from President Donald Trump, that seems to be tailor-made for Zerohash. “It’s not that they weren’t doing any work on this stuff already,” Woodford, referring to financial institutions. “But they just weren’t able to move into the space, and now there’s a clear path for them to be able to do so.” While Woodford wouldn’t disclose his startup’s revenue or whether it was profitable, he did say Zerohash has increased its topline each year over the past three years, even during the Crypto Winter of 2022 through 2024. Zerohash, which has about 200 employees, has three business verticals. It develops a white-labeled crypto brokerage that companies like Interactive Brokers can spin up to more easily let their customers buy and sell digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It has APIs for tokenization, which has helped, for example, BlackRock tokenize money market funds. And it builds stablecoin networks to let customers, including Stripe, more easily send and receive the tokens. “Zerohash has been able to grow with headwinds,” said Woodford. “Imagine what it looks like with tailwinds.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

September 23, 2025 7:30am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Jaime Magyera, Head of U.S. Wealth & Retirement, BlackRock, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in Business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast. Wow, what can I say? Jamie Majera is head of BlackRock’s US wealth advisory business, as well as running their retirement business. BlackRock is the $12 trillion investment giant, the biggest asset manager in the world. Jamie is been working for the firm effectively since 2001, where she began at Merrill Lynch investment managers, which was merged with BlackRock in oh six. She’s risen through the ranks and has really seen every aspect of the wealth management and product services, everything from iShares to their alpha products to alternatives. She has quite a fascinating history, and there are a few people better able to describe and discuss how the wealth management business is changing and where it’s going. Then her, I, I found this conversation to be fascinating, and I think you will also, with no further ado, BlackRock’s head of US Wealth Advisory Business. Jamie Mara, Jaime Magyera: It is so good to be here. Barry Ritholtz: It’s so good to have you. I’ve been looking forward to this conversation, but I wanna, before we get up to, to the US wealth advisory business of and retirement business of BlackRock, let’s talk a little bit about your background. You go to University of Pennsylvania undergraduate. What’d you study? What was the plan? Jaime Magyera: So I studied psychology. I went to University of Pennsylvania. My brother went there as well. My sister went there as well. Psychology major. I, I didn’t have a plan. I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I was that kid that loved working. So I had, you know, any job I had when I was growing up, I just loved, I was a babysitter. I worked at a bakery, I taught tennis lessons. I did it all, and I loved it. Taught tennis… Barry Ritholtz: Are you any good? You still play? Jaime Magyera: I’m incredible. You play regular. Don’t ask my husband Barry Ritholtz: Singles or Doubles? Jaime Magyera: So I don’t play well or regularly any longer. There is a story behind that, which maybe I’ll share with you, but my husband does play tennis. He’s incredible, and he coaches at West Point. Barry Ritholtz: Wow, That’s amazing. Yeah. Yeah. So what was the first gig, right? Outta U Penn? Jaime Magyera: Yeah, so, so, you know, I was a psychology major and I knew that I was fascinated with people and also with distribution, and I’ll come on that in a second, because I was a music person. I loved music. I wanted to be in the music industry. So my plan was do I go FBI criminal psychology, or do I go into the music industry? Barry Ritholtz: Very similar, And I’m not being sarcastic because you’re profiling people who perhaps have certain deviant perspectives about the world. Yeah. Jaime Magyera: I’ll leave it there. Okay. And so I, I had to make a decision, and so I, I was going towards the music industry, and so people always say, well, were you a performer? Did you sing? Were you classically trained? The answer is no. But I was fascinated with the business of music and the distribution of music. And so at that time, remember it was kind of Napster, right? So like, things were going Barry Ritholtz: From wait, like late nineties? Is that what you’re talking about? Yeah. Jaime Magyera: Oh yeah. So we’re going from CDs to digital distribution, and I just found it to be fascinating and, and what did that mean for the business and the implications for artists? And so I had this dream. I was going to be a big time record label exec. I had internships. I got a job at the time. It was Sony, BMG. Oh, sure. And then I realized as I got my offer letter that I wasn’t quite sure how I was going to, you know, sustain my life, pay my bills, my parents helped massively with college, but there was some student debt that I had to pay off. And so at the time, my brother was a financial advisor, and so I called him up and I said, Hey, big bro, what do you recommend? What should I do? And I was thinking he’d give me some financial advice, and his advice was, get a real job that’s going to help you pay your bills, and then you can go back into music after. And so that’s kind of how I made my way into finance. Barry Ritholtz: So what was the real job? Jaime Magyera: The real job was working at Merrill Lynch investment. Barry Ritholtz: So your whole career, you’ve been in the same, I’ve been more or less the same place. That’s amazing. Jaime Magyera: Yeah. And, and it, and there’s this theme as you kind of look through different things I’ve done throughout my career, but I started at Merrill Investment Managers, which was the asset management arm of, of Merrill Lynch. And I wanted to be the, the farthest thing away from markets because I had no experience, I didn’t know what the markets were, I didn’t even know what a mutual fund was. And so I joined Merrill as an analyst in their analyst program, and I was a technology project manager. Barry Ritholtz: Wait, so as an analyst, did you become a CFA? Did you go through that process or…? Jaime Magyera: No, I did not. So you get all of your series sevens and everything else, but I was responsible for, again, let’s date ourselves here. The late nineties, early two thousands e-business was the thing, right? So it, how do you… Barry Ritholtz: Gonna be big one day, it’s Jaime Magyera: There’s this whole thing called the internet. And so at the time, Merrill did not even have a website for their financial advisors. Barry Ritholtz: How is that possible? Jaime Magyera: I know. Can you imagine 2001? Barry Ritholtz: Yep. We’re gonna, we’re gonna wait and see if this thing becomes big takes off… Jaime Magyera: Right. I have a feeling. Right. So that’s, I feel Barry Ritholtz: I have a good feeling about this one. Jaime Magyera: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So’s that’s unbelievable. That’s kind of where I started, and it was, Barry Ritholtz: So did you help build out the first set of Merrill Lynch websites? Yeah. For their, is this for outward facing for clients, internally for advisors and brokers, or a little bit of everything for advisors and brokers. Jaime Magyera: And so that’s where I first learned, you know, the role of the financial advisor and what it is to be a financial advisor and how you serve your clients and how hard it is and what it is to actually sell and support and serve those financial advisors. But that was the job. It was translating technology, speak into business and client needs. Hmm. Barry Ritholtz: Really interesting. Yeah. So I know you’ve had multiple, multiple roles at both Merrill and BlackRock. Let’s quickly walk up the ladder. Yeah. So from that, what was the next role? Jaime Magyera: So, I always had this, this idea that I wanted to get closer to the client. So I would move, and you’ll see my, for my career, I moved into roles that were closer to clients. So from there, I went into marketing, which you really learned strategic messaging and how to simplify and, and help people understand what you’re doing. I then went into our retirement business where there, I, I used to help participants understand how to enroll in their 401k plan. I mean, literally going around the country, helping people figure out how to save and how to invest. And then I moved back into the wealth business, which is where I am today, along with leading our retirement business. And the wealth business was the first time when I came back into it that I actually had direct client accountability. And that was important to me because I had done technology and marketing and product and strategy and everything else, but I had never been responsible for helping to solve client problems directly. Barry Ritholtz: And, and to clarify, you didn’t just kinda move into the wealth business. You are the head of BlackRock’s US wealth advisory business that is not like just, you’re not just casually drifting into that space. You are running it. So, so let’s talk a little bit about how you got there. So Maryland BlackRock merged in 2006 when the dust settled. What was your title back then? Jaime Magyera: So back then I had moved into marketing, and I was the head of marketing for our wealth business. Then fast forward to BlackRock, acquired BGI and iShares, Barry Ritholtz: I recall one the greatest acquisitions in finance history Jaime Magyera:And, and a and a theme for BlackRock on just structural growth and how we view where, where the world is going and how we meet the needs to be there. But at that point, leadership had asked me to bring together all of the retirement businesses that were legacy BlackRock, legacy, iShares, legacy BGI, and I was part of that team working, Barry Ritholtz: In other words, turn it into one, one unified company instead of all these separate pieces. Jaime Magyera: That’s right, Barry Ritholtz: That’s right. How long did that process take? Jaime Magyera: It was, I mean, every day was another step in that process. And, you know, we learn over the years how important it is to integrate and to acquire. When you acquire, you’re acquiring for capabilities, but you’re acquiring for talent and culture. And so the match between the firms is really strong. And that helped us to integrate even faster. Barry Ritholtz: So, so you began this process late 2006, and right around the corner comes to financial crisis. How did that get in the way or affect this entire post-merger situation? It had to be pretty disruptive, certainly on the client level. How did it affect what you were doing? Jaime Magyera: Yeah, I mean, it, of course it was disruptive. And, and I think this kind of goes back to part of the vision with BlackRock always was, and I I mentioned the term structural growth, but what does that really mean? It means durable engines of growth, resilient engine of growth, growth that can persist market cycles. And so even through a financial crisis, the fact that we had our iShares ETF range, we had fixed income, we had equity, we had cash, we had everything you could imagine. And we had Aladdin, remember Aladdin, our technology platform was massively helpful to so many firms and institutions and, and governments during that time. So we had multiple ways to, to lead through that and help our clients through that crisis. Barry Ritholtz: Really, really quite fascinating. And back then, you know, it was a couple of trillion dollars. Now BlackRock is what, 11, $12 trillion? 12? [Yep]. That the largest asset manager in the world. I wanna say Vanguard is probably 10, 20% behind you, nipping at your heels. But between Vanguard and BlackRock, these are two of the most storied firms. And in fact, the new CEO of Vanguard used to run a division over at BlackRock, Jaime Magyera: Great friend of mine, ce, which, really just goes to tell, Barry Ritholtz: I recall interviewing him when he was at, at BlackRock, and like, huh, that guy’s gonna go somewhere one day. Jaime Magyera: But what’s fascinating is just how unbelievably successful the I share business became. But it, people tend to think of, retail investors tend to think about BlackRock in terms of iShares, but BlackRock is really so much more, it’s not only passive beta, but there are alpha seeking strategies. And as we’ll discuss later, there are alternatives. So there are a lot of things going on at BlackRock as head of the US Wealth advisory. What is the core focus? What are, what are the balls that you keep in the air all the time? Jaime Magyera: Yeah. So one of the things I love about the wealth business generally is that it is changing so rapidly. It’s dynamic every day there is something new investor preferences are changing, there’s different client segments. And as you said, it’s not just about iShares. I mean, we have so many capabilities that we can bring to bear. And so when we wake up every day, what we think about at BlackRock is how do we make investing easier, right? How do we get more people access to the capital markets? And that used to be public markets, now it’s public and private markets. But that’s what we do. And when you think about our wealth business, we do that through financial advisors and with wealth management firms. So our job in our wealth business is to help advisors and the firms that they work for build better portfolios for their clients so that they can achieve their dreams. And we aim to power their growth to help them scale their businesses so that they can do what they do best, which is serving their clients. And so that’s what we wake up doing every single day in the wealth business. Barry Ritholtz: So I’ve seen a variety of various BlackRock model portfolios. If you have a a, a a bond ladder that you have concerns about, you can run it by the BlackRock folks. And, hey, here are your options. We really haven’t talked about sma, which I know is a really fast growing part of the business. Is there a priority or are all these things just day by day, you’re just checking off different boxes and working on different projects? Jaime Magyera: Yeah, so our priority is, is serving the client, meeting their need. And when we look at the wealth market and talk to advisors every single day, there’s really three call ’em, client segments, investor segments that advisors are trying to serve and, and win and build relationships with. And we’re trying to help the advisor do so. So those three segments, think about the next gen investor, think about women, and think about high net worth. And we’ll hit on kind of direct indexing and everything that we do through that. But if you think about those three segments, and it’s a broad way to think about this, you know, there’s exceptions to every rule here, but next gen, what are we talking about? It’s the millennials, right? It’s, it’s, it’s Barry Ritholtz: And Gen Z, right? And Gen Z, Jaime Magyera: it’s 44% of the population. So it is a massive number by quantity, but it’s also a massive number by assets, right? That generation is going to inherit 70 trillion plus in assets over the next few years. And so what’s interesting and what’s different about these folks is that they want to invest in line with their beliefs. They’re incredibly tech savvy. In fact, they trust digital and social more than they might even trust humans these days. But they want advice from advisors, and they want to invest in things that are new and interesting. And so you think about Bitcoin, right? Bitcoin, 80 plus percent of millennial millionaires hold crypto. They’re more inclined to use crypto than stocks and mutual funds. So what we were doing and investing and innovating in, in service of client demand is creating a, a Bitcoin ETFI bet. Barry Ritholtz: One of, if not the fastest growing ETF in history, fastest to a billion, to 5 billion to 10 billion. I haven’t even looked at what it is. Jaime Magyera: 85 Billion Barry Ritholtz: UN unbelievable. This is less than two years old, right? Yes. Yes. That’s incredible. Yeah. $85 billion. Yep. And no passwords, no loss this no that they, they’ve taken what was a, you know, whenever I see the return claims for, for Bitcoin, I always have to point out, hey, 20, 30% of coins have been lost, lost passwords have been lost. Drives break. So subtract a third of off of that. Yeah. But really it’s, it’s this or zero if you totally lost it, you guys have made this a, a traditional financial product. Yeah. So it, it’s pretty amazing. And we’ve seen like a general acceptance of, hey, everybody should have 1% or maybe a little more, a little less, whatever your needs are of some Bitcoin. And this seems to be the easiest way to do it. Jaime Magyera: I think we’ll see a lot more of that too. I think we’re going to see a lot of firms coming out now to say, we are actually going to allow advisors to incorporate this into portfolios on the fee-based side on the advisory platforms. And so I think this is just the beginning, but it’s also just a perfect example of if you understand where clients are going and you have the capability set to innovate and build products around it, then you can deliver those products to market and help advisors better serve their clients. Barry Ritholtz: And I bid’s a perfect example of that. Yep. Really, really quite fascinating coming up, we continue our conversation with Jamie Majera, head of BlackRock’s US Wealth advisory business and head of BlackRock’s retirement business, discussing wealth management and retirement. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in business on Bloomberg Radio. I’m speaking this week with Jamie Majera. She’s head of BlackRock’s US wealth advisory business as well as retirement business. So, so let’s talk a little bit about both of these. I wanna start with the wealth management business. This is more than just iShares. This is very holistic and comprehensive. Tell us a little bit about the US wealth advisory business. Jaime Magyera: So our business is really focused on helping those advisors who are really trying to go after multiple client segments and, and help those client segments actually meet their goals. And so, you know, we talked a little bit about next gen and kind of the millennials and Gen Z. The other segment that is just growing in incredible rates is women. Women today control a third of the world’s assets. In a few years it’ll be 50%, it’ll be 70% by 2050, Barry Ritholtz: 70%. Wow. Jaime Magyera: 70%. And you know, part of this is, let’s talk about what’s driving this. Women are creating wealth, right? More women are having careers or reaching executive levels or starting their own businesses. Women are also inheriting wealth, right? From family or from parents. Women are also inheriting wealth. We call it the horizontal wealth transfer. Sure. The spouse, right. Divorce or widowed out wi live the husband. Barry Ritholtz: Yes. And so it’s a way station before it goes to the kids. Jaime Magyera: Absolutely. Absolutely. And women are quite frankly, underserved in this market. Women were not seen as a, as a significant growth segment in the past. And now people are starting to come around to, wait a minute, this is a very important segment that we need to get right. And women do things differently. And so advisors need to help women do things differently and they need to serve them a little bit differently. And women, you know, like to have impact. We, we, we talk about the fact that some people invest as a means to an end. You know, women tend to invest as a means to what’s next, right? They wanna impact their community, they wanna impact their family. They’re always thinking about, what can I do with this money as opposed to, I want to make more money. And so that’s, it’s a nuance, but it’s a difference that that really requires a, a very personal relationship with a financial advisor and trust. Barry Ritholtz: You know, it’s been fascinating seeing what was previously a male dominated industry, slowly awakened to the idea that, hey, women have money Yeah. And they’re gonna continue to accrue more money. Maybe we should be more open to coming up with a way to, to serve that demographic. It, it’s like amazing, it’s taken so many decades for the industry to adjust, but it’s shockingly slow and sometimes stuck a little bit in the past. Yeah, Jaime Magyera: It is. You know, the wake up call, I think, for many is when a financial advisor has a client, maybe it’s the, the man in the household and perhaps there’s a divorce or there’s a, or the, or the client passes away, listen, 70% of women leave their financial advisor, leave their husband’s financial advisor after a divorce or a death. So 00:18:15 [Speaker Changed] Obvious with divorce, but with death, it tells you what a terrible job that advisor did. Speaking to both of those, and you know, I’ve heard stories from advisors about people kind of aghast at somebody ignoring the spouse in the room. It’s just a totally wrong, wrong approach. How does BlackRock help their advisor clients address this issue? 00:18:39 [Speaker Changed] So we believe there is such an opportunity for advice here, right there. I mean, there’s, there’s just this whole world of women who want advice. They wanna coach, they wanna partner. And so what we do is we work with financial advisors to help them better serve these clients. We do that through products. So for example, women want to be able to customize and personalize their investments to things that are, that are important to them. So we’ll talk about direct indexing, but direct indexing and what we’re doing through Aperio is a great way for an advisor to serve his client and help her have impact with what she’s doing. We also care deeply about educating advisors on this. And to your point, it’s not that the industry just woke up, is that nobody was really talking about it. And so now we’re really invested in talking about this and helping and doing events and getting advisors to bring their prospects in and we’ll join them. We are a minority investor in a company called Willow, which focuses exactly on this. It builds practice management and education and, and actually helps connect female investors to advisors. And so we’re really focused on this and it’s just such an opportunity for advice, but also an opportunity for advisors to grow their business. 00:19:50 [Speaker Changed] So you mentioned Aperio. Let’s talk a little bit about direct indexing. I’m a big fan of it. We happen to have started on a different product five, six years ago, so we’ve been pretty locked in on that. Why do you believe it’s gaining so much popularity amongst both advisors and clients? 00:20:08 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so direct indexing, it’s, it still sounds like a new phrase to many. It’s been around for quite some time. And previously it was really used for ultra, ultra high net worth families and direct indexing an ability to create a portfolio, a custom index if you will, of securities that you can choose and select what securities you want in that portfolio to align with how you want to invest. And you can also then manage taxes more effectively in there because you can tax loss harvest. And so it’s a brilliant approach for not only aligning with your beliefs on how you invest, but also really living in an after-tax world. We need to better look at tax alpha in our investment portfolio. 00:20:49 [Speaker Changed] So I’m so glad you said that. When we first started working with Shawnessy on their product, I, I was under the impression that it would first be like the most common use case would be, Hey, I don’t want tobacco or guns, or I don’t want this, whatever. I know the New York Bishop’s Archdiocese investment pool uses it to say, Hey, we don’t wanna board efficient in our portfolio or anything related to stuff that is in contradiction with our belief system. I thought that would be the biggest use. And then, hey, I work for Apple, so I don’t need all this tech. You could tune down tech in my portfolio and then taxes would bring up the rear. I had it exactly backwards in, in the past five, six years after tax returns. Tax Alpha seems to be the dominant usage for this concentrated portfolios, low basis cost, inherited stock, things like that really are a challenge to dealing with capital gains. Tell us about BlackRock’s experience with this. 00:21:52 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so we agree completely. In fact, back in 2021, we acquired the firm aerio. And Aerio was a pioneer in direct indexing. Aperio led the market working with ultra high net worth. They called it the new institutional for the purpose of tax management after tax returns. And you think about it, we live in an after tax world. I bought my coffee with after tax dollars, yet we manage our investments before tax. And so we saw this trend coming and we could have built it, it would’ve taken us probably a lot more time, right? But we saw what Aperia was doing and their capabilities and just their approach. And we thought, man, if we could match that with our distribution reach and our scale, we could really make some wonderful, wonderful solutions for our clients. And that’s what we did. We acquired Aperio and we have a very significant direct indexing business. And to your point, Barry, it is predominantly tax customization, tax management, 00:22:51 [Speaker Changed] Right? Any e, especially when we see markets are at all time highs, people are sitting on enormous gains. Sometimes that becomes very concentrated to say nothing of people who work for tech stocks and they’ve accumulated, or other companies that have just accumulated so much value that, hey, maybe I have too much single stock risk and I wanna diversify into things. Tell us, what else does BlackRock do with direct indexing? How do you differentiate yourself for everybody these days seems to have a direct indexing product. What makes BlackRock’s special or unique? 00:23:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so you know, one of the things that we did is when we acquired Aperio, we already had a very significant separately managed account business. I mean for, for decades we had fixed income and active equity. And what we did not have was that direct indexing capability. When we brought aperio into BlackRock, we then pulled it all together and said, how can we actually make all of these capabilities together better serve our clients? So that means, for example, tax loss harvesting on Muni portfolios, right? So being able to take a capability and not just do it on on equities, but do it on fixed income. Last year we acquired a company called Spider Rock. I’m not sure if you’re familiar with Spider Rock. 00:24:04 [Speaker Changed] We’ve structured notes. Yes, we’ve used them in the past. 00:24:06 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And option overlays 00:24:07 [Speaker Changed] A similar kind of, not quite the same, but occasionally similar, A different solution to a similar problem. 00:24:14 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And to your point on concentrated stock, what a great way to hedge that concentrated stock position. If I wanna continue holding that stock, but I wanna hedge against it and manage the risk, or I wanna manage for tax implications, why not run an option overlay on top of that? And so the beauty of what we’re doing now is we’re bringing all of these discreet capabilities together into one portfolio, one holistic offering. And so you’ll be able to, we’ll be able to work with advisors and say, let’s look across your client’s entire book and let us help you build a whole portfolio of public markets, private markets, direct indexing, option overlay, all in one, really solving for unique needs, customized preferences. 00:24:54 [Speaker Changed] Really quite fascinating. So you mentioned you work with a lot of different wealth management firms. What does that relationship look like? What are these firms looking for from BlackRock? 00:25:05 [Speaker Changed] So I remember when I first started in the wealth business, years and years and years and years ago, you know, the relationship between asset managers and wealth management firms was often a kind of a vendor relationship. Yes. Right? It was, you have a product, let’s put it over here. Our position and our partnership with wealth management firms today is the only word I would say. It’s, it’s like true partnership, right? It’s aligned interests. We are there to not only provide them with investment capabilities, by the way, we have incredible breadth to do so, but we’re also there to help them with their technology needs, their operational and scale needs, their advisory needs. How can we help them think through how they can grow organic growth? That’s everyone’s challenge. How do I grow organically? Well, you have to scale your business and and increase your margins to do so. We help them think through all of that. And the other thing that we do is we have incredible people that are so expert in working with these firms and advisors every single day to help them achieve their goals. And our view is if, if we can help our clients, the wealth management firms and their advisors grow, we’ll naturally grow with them, right? So our job is to help them grow. 00:26:14 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk retirement. We’re recording this post Labor Day, but by the time this comes out, BlackRock’s big report, the read on retirement will be out. Tell us some of the big takeaways for this. 00:26:29 [Speaker Changed] So it’s really special for me personally because I’ve just now returned into the retirement business and have the responsibility for this retirement business. And I say it’s a responsibility and an honor because we think about the 35 million people across America that we are helping to save for retirement. Like that is, that is what we do. Over half of the assets at BlackRock, not many people know this. Over half of the assets at BlackRock are helping people save for retirement in some way. Really 00:26:58 [Speaker Changed] Over half. So when you say that it’s 4 0 1 Ks, 4 0 3 Bs, IRAs, Annie 00:27:02 [Speaker Changed] Pensions, db, wow. Yes. 00:27:05 [Speaker Changed] All of that. That’s amazing. 00:27:06 [Speaker Changed] Over 50%. And that’s, I would not 00:27:07 [Speaker Changed] Have guessed 00:27:07 [Speaker Changed] That. Yeah, not many people know that. And so, you know, it’s something that we, we are so proud of and, and really for me it was always my north star. I remember when I was first in the retirement business at BlackRock, I was able to go home and tell my parents what I did and explain it to them in a way that I felt so good about and they understood and, and that’s what we get to do every day. You mentioned the survey. So it’s our 10 year anniversary of doing the survey. Wow. We’ve been doing it for a decade now. And every time we go out, we go to plan sponsors who are the employers building the plans and offering them to their employees. We go to the Savers who are the employees at massive corporations. And then we also talk to retirees, people that have saved and had access to a 401k plan, but they’re now no longer working and they’re in retirement. And so this year, I’ll break it down in this way, savers, those that are still working, the employers of these or the employees of this company, savers have the highest confidence we’ve ever seen. Hmm. Like off the charts, confidence. Now it’s come down a little bit because of market volatility. And I think what that calls out is, of course we’re all more confident when markets are, are rising, right? But very strong confidence in their ability to retire. However, we’ve seen savings come down. And so the question is, is that because of confidence, 00:28:21 [Speaker Changed] When you say savings, we mean savings rates. Savings rates, 00:28:24 [Speaker Changed] Right? Savings rates have come down. Thank you. And so the question is, is that because of confidence or is that because actually people are spending more money they need to maybe inflation maybe, right? So like we have to dig into that a little bit more. But importantly, savers are seeing more confidence or feeling more confident. You then ask the people in charge the experts who are building those plans. Confidence is very low, in fact lower than we’ve seen. Hmm. And I’ll come back to that in a moment. But I think there’s a really interesting tension there of perhaps overconfidence in savers and reality in those building the plans. And then when we move on to retirees, very low confidence once they’ve retired and their ability to actually figure out how to sustain their life in retirement. And so some of the actions or some of the insights that really came out of this one Savers are looking for access to professionally managed solutions. Think target date funds, right? LifePath portfolios. BlackRock invented the target date fund 30 years ago, but target date funds are very, very important. Two is Savers are looking for some type of clarity or solution around guaranteed income. Give me something that will just tell me what I’m going to be able to spend every month and better yet make that guaranteed. So I know I have it every month. 00:29:37 [Speaker Changed] So what does that look like? Are we talking an annuity product or something else? 00:29:41 [Speaker Changed] So imagine a target date fund with a guaranteed income sleeve in that. So we have a product called LifePath paycheck. LifePath paycheck is among a few other solutions in the marketplace, but LifePath paycheck is the fastest growing guaranteed income solution. What’s amazing about this solution though is that it, it gives employers and employees the choice to turn on that guaranteed income. So you’re investing, investing, investing, and then you come to a point and you decide, do I want that guaranteed income? Flip the switch. Flip the switch, huh. Really interesting. Really interesting. And then the third point is people, both employers and employees are saying, we need to to close the gap on this saving shortfall and we need to find more returns and more protections. And so that’s really where you start to point to private markets in target 00:30:26 [Speaker Changed] Date funds. So the, I think of the traditional retirement savings as classic 60 40, and what I’ve been reading about and hearing about for the past 10 plus years is, hey, 60 40 isn’t gonna get it done in the future, especially with yields as low as they’ve been up until 2022. Anyway. How do you see this side of the business changing? Is it no longer 60 40? Is it 60 30 10? Or what does this look like? Yeah, 00:30:52 [Speaker Changed] So it’s, you know, the, the one thing that’s different about the retirement space is it’s, versus the wealth space is retirement is quite slow moving. The market itself is quite slow moving. And so if you actually look back 20 years, I would say there’s probably less change over 20 years than we’ll expect to see over the next 10. Meaning people are getting very focused policy makers, employers, asset managers, record keepers on how do we close the gap between this retirement saving shortfall. And so to your question, the 60 40 worked it, it works, but actually if you were to have a 50, 30, 20, but strategically and thoughtfully make sure that that glide path, that target date fund that also incorporates private markets is doing so in a way that helps people get more diversification, gain alpha, possibly gain more income. We’ve done studies that show you can get 15% more return on a portfolio with private markets, a target date fund with private markets over a 40 year retirement. And so that’s something to talk about. 00:31:53 [Speaker Changed] Not, not, not nothing that’s pretty substantial Coming up, we continue our conversation with Jamie Majera, head of BlackRock’s US wealth advisory business, as well as head of BlackRock’s retirement business, discussing the rise of alternatives in the investment space at BlackRock. I’m Barry Ritholtz, you are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I’m Barry Ritholtz, your listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My guest this week is Jamie Magera. She is the head of BlackRock’s US wealth advisory business as well as the head of their retirement business. The firm manages over $12 trillion. So let’s talk about alternatives. This has been one of the fastest growing space in in investing. Tell us what BlackRock is doing. I think a BlackRock of iShares and biggest manager of public equities and bonds in the world. What is BlackRock doing with alternatives? 00:33:03 [Speaker Changed] So if you think about the capital markets, public is only one piece of those capital markets. And for so long private markets, the other part of capital markets have been utilized for institutions or even the ultra, ultra ultra high net worth. And so there is a world to believe strongly an investment thesis that if you’re going to do the best thing for a portfolio or an investment, you need full exposure to public and to private markets. And so BlackRock is doing a lot to help advisors and their clients have easier access to private markets. So you may recall last year we had a whirlwind news announcements around H-P-S-G-I-P pre Quinn, three acquisitions all related to private markets pre Quinn related to data, GIP infrastructure, HPS, credit and private financing. And so we acquired these firms so that we could offer to our clients not just the full power of the capital markets through public but now also through private. And so we are very focused on, on really democratizing access, helping everyday people when appropriate gain access to this very important part of the capital markets. 00:34:19 [Speaker Changed] And I mentioned earlier, 60 40, you peel 10% off the 60 and 10% off the 40 and you end up with something that looks like 50, 30, 20. Is that the future of this? Because I typically, we see a lot of privates, they tend to be locked up for a long period of time. They tend to be complex to administer custodians and reporting and fees. It’s like you buy an iShare, it’s easy, you want to get involved on the private side. It just seems so much more complex for anyone less than, I don’t know, pick a number. 20 million, 10 million, right? 5 million. So what does the future of alternative investment look like at BlackRock? 00:34:59 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so you, you hit on it, right? I mean it was so hard for people to gain access to it. It was complicated if they were able to get access to it. And to your point, liquidity was not necessarily a top priority for various reasons. When you think about where the market is going now, there’s just been so much change over the wealth industry on how the wealth industry as a whole is starting to modernize access to private markets. And so one thing we are doing at BlackRock is we focused very much on technology partnerships that allow and and relieve the advisor of all of that operational complexity. So you think about a firm like iCapital, iCapital reviews 00:35:40 [Speaker Changed] Of which you are on the board of 00:35:41 [Speaker Changed] Correct? I am on the board and you know, iCapital has done so much to actually pave the way for advisor’s ability, wealth management firm’s ability to access private markets. But they are a technology platform. You still need the products. And to your point on drawdown and liquidity, we’ve done so much work to build solutions that actually are semi-liquid and that provide that liquidity on a regular basis for advisors and their clients. And so that’s something that has, you know, really held advisors back in the past. I think the last point, Barry, is it’s still new to so many and there’s a lot of education that’s needed. Sure. And you know, it’s education on the asset class and, and what does this really mean and how do I actually strip the 10% here and the 10% there? And so we’ve gone a step further to say, how do we make it even easier for advisors to build portfolios? Not that I have my private markets over here and my public markets over there and another account, but instead, how do I build a portfolio that’s one account and it holds public and private together in one portfolio that’s professionally managed asset allocation. All of the due diligence has been done. And so recently we’ve engaged in partnerships with firms like Geo Wealth and I Capital to be able to bring models to market, strategic asset allocated models that are professionally managed that incorporate private markets alongside of public markets. 00:37:02 [Speaker Changed] So the pushback I hear from various people about alternatives, they’re expensive, they’re liquid, you have these long lockups doing due diligence is complex and expensive. All of the back office aspects seem to be like a series of one-offs. There’s no real scalability. How are you addressing these, these issues? We 00:37:25 [Speaker Changed] Have found a way to scale and make it more convenient. So all of that work that you just talked about, the due diligence, the operations, the complexity, we have taken that on. We have built model portfolios that do all of that for the advisor. The advisor just has to offer that to their client. 00:37:42 [Speaker Changed] Is this in an SMA or is this how, how does this Yeah, so my firm, we, we we’re BlackRock, Vanguard, a handful of other, the bulk of our portfolios either direct indexing or, or mutual funds or ETFs, looks like that some, some clients say, what do you guys offer in terms of alternatives? And we have to click off and run a stuff. And what I’ve noticed is once you start working into the, here’s the cost and here’s the lockup and here’s what the reporting looks like and it’s held at a custodian here, the complexity tends to be like, is this really worth it? Well, theoretically it provides diversification and historically there have been some cases of, of outperformance all that comes off the advisor’s plate and you guys handle all of 00:38:29 [Speaker Changed] It. So if an advisor wanted to build a portfolio for you, you’re the client, the advisor could call BlackRock could say, I wanna build a custom portfolio, I want it to have this component of public markets. Maybe it’s iShares ETFs, maybe it’s direct indexing aperio. I would like it to have this component of private markets. Perhaps it’s BlackRock credit, BlackRock equity on the private side. We will customize that for them and then it’s waiting for them on a platform like Geo Wealth, which is a, you know, geo wealth, well a technology platform that will automatically rebalance it for them and that advisor can now then invest their clients in that portfolio. 00:39:04 [Speaker Changed] How about if a firm comes up to you and says, Hey, we’re pretty good on the stocks and bonds side. We really need help on the alt side and we have such embedded long-term gains that it’s painful to, to peel too much off, but going forward we wanna build this into what we offer and add this to existing clients. What does that solution look like? Call 00:39:27 [Speaker Changed] BlackRock. We have a team of, you asked about CFAs earlier, we have a team of CFAs portfolio consultants, tax economists who do nothing but work with advisors every day on solving those problems. They will work, they will consult, they’ll help them take the portfolio they have. We want to meet the advisors where they are, right? So we want to help them build on what they have and we’ll work with them to take that portfolio and transition it into whatever the destination is they’re going for. We’ll work with them in a way to do IT tax efficiently and at the appropriate cadence for their client. 00:40:00 [Speaker Changed] And you guys very successfully took crypto and Bitcoin and put it into an ETF. Are we ever gonna get to a point where Alts become an ETF product? 00:40:10 [Speaker Changed] Look, I think there is a world where so much can happen, right? In the next five years. I think we’re going to see a lot of things around private markets. Part of that is solving for data and having the transparency around the private markets. What is an ETF? Right? It’s transparency into that index. Part of our thought process in acquiring precan was being able to offer data transparency around private markets. But I also think that sometimes people naturally go to ETF as kind of shorthand for liquidity, convenient and low cost. And I think there’s a lot of ways that we have to figure out as an industry and BlackRock’s working on this right now, how do you structure and build vehicles that allow for liquidity, allow for lower cost and allow for easier access, less complexity around private markets. Maybe it’s an ETF, maybe it’s something else. Yeah, 00:41:00 [Speaker Changed] Liquidity is always the challenge. When you have an investment product that by design is supposed to play out over 5, 7, 8 years, they’re not public for a reason. They need the breadth for whatever that market cycle is to, to realize those gains. So I get the challenge. What are you doing to educate advisors and clients about what this process looks like? 00:41:23 [Speaker Changed] I’m glad you asked that because I keep coming back to liquidity is a challenge when it does not match an expectation of a client. And so advisors need to fully understand what they’re working with when they delve into private markets. And in some cases it is a five to seven year lockup if they’re doing draw downs. In some cases you do have a liquidity interval every quarter. And so we are working with advisors all across the industry to help educate them on the new type of private markets, the new vehicles, the semi-liquid structures, but then more so we’re working with them to help them understand how do you actually put that in a whole portfolio? Talk to me about how private markets sits alongside of public markets and what that does for the risk profile, for the return profile and for the liquidity profile. 00:42:13 [Speaker Changed] And, and BlackRock launched a model, I wanna say earlier this year that uses both private and public assets under one ticker. That sounds like really challenging to put together. Tell us a little bit about that. 00:42:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it was challenging, very challenging. And it was something that we could not do alone for all of the reasons you, you mentioned it took operations and technology platforms like iCapital, it took operations and, and rebalancing and trade platforms like geo wealth to be able to allow us to deliver this portfolio. So this was something that we announced earlier this year alongside of Geo wealth and iCapital. And it was the first of its kind in the industry, a model portfolio that in one model, in one account you can have public and private automatic rebalancing customized for your client done so easily. So conveniently, 00:43:07 [Speaker Changed] Some of what you’re describing sounds a little bit like O CIOs that kind of were the rage a few years ago. Outsource CIOs where a professional manager can bring a higher level of professional wealth management to a smaller shop. TE tell us, is this similar to that or, or what are the parallels? 00:43:27 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it’s, it’s a, it is one of the most accelerated trend we are seeing in the wealth market right now, which is this whole notion of outsourcing and whether an advisor is doing it because they want to professionalize what they’re offering to their client or whether an advisor is choosing to outsource because they want to save time and their value is being with the client and talking about the holistic wealth plan, not the investment management component of it. And so they turn to BlackRock to be the outsourced provider. And so we have a models business, which is effectively an OCIO business. A A models business for the wealth channel is 350 billion today. It’s grown rapidly over the past few years. We think that’ll double in the next few years. And it’s because advisors are turning to us to say, please let us outsource to you. And it’s not just advisors, wealth managers are doing the same because again, wealth managers are going to focus on their core value, which is serving their clients, helping their clients build financial plans and helping them navigate their wealth picture holistically. They turn to BlackRock to help them, them scale their investment management. And that’s where our outsourcing capabilities come in. 00:44:35 [Speaker Changed] So we’ve talked about wealth management, we’ve talked about iShares and as well as alpha pursuit and retirement planning. My last question for you is, what do you think advisors, clients, investors are not thinking about but perhaps should be? What, what important topics? It could be an asset, it could be a geography, it could be a policy or data point. What do you think is getting overlooked but just shouldn’t? 00:45:01 [Speaker Changed] I think taxes is still not being discussed enough. Taxes as a concept. I mean there is so much value you can bring as an advisor to your client by just having that conversation, asking the question. So I would encourage everyone to do that. That is such a way to build loyalty, trust, and deepen relationship. And by the way, your client starts to tell you where they have assets elsewhere. The other area I would say is just really thinking about the future growth drivers of, of our economy. So infrastructure, ai, we didn’t talk about ai, but the, the the, 00:45:32 [Speaker Changed] It’s gonna be another thing. Another 00:45:33 [Speaker Changed] Thing that might turn into something. 00:45:35 [Speaker Changed] Right, right. Gonna be big one day. Exactly. 00:45:36 [Speaker Changed] But I, you know, you think about some of these future growth drivers infrastructure as part of, you know, why we acquired GIP, but we have iShare solutions that really align with infrastructure as well. And I just think that’s such a under discussed opportunity. Huh, 00:45:51 [Speaker Changed] Really interesting. Alright, I only have you for a few more minutes. So let’s jump to our favorite questions that we ask all our guests. Starting with tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 00:46:02 [Speaker Changed] Oh, so this is such a good question and hard question. I will answer it this way. There are so many, I love to have a board of directors approach. Like I have this whole crew of people that I go to for different things and I, I truly like, you know, you mentioned Lene Ramey, he’s one of them. Martin Small, Rob Goldstein, Rob Capto, mark Weidman. Like there’s so many Anne Ackerley who used to run the retirement business at BlackRock and they’ve all played a different role in my career and in my life. 00:46:30 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. Let’s talk books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 00:46:36 [Speaker Changed] Lama Llama Red Pajama 00:46:39 [Speaker Changed] To your Kids at Night? Is that what that is? I 00:46:41 [Speaker Changed] Have a 4-year-old. He loves Lama Llama. So any Lama llama you can imagine. But actually I just finished a great book for the second time. A more beautiful question, huh? Warren Berger. It talks about the art of inquiry and using inquiry to, I mean, gosh, the heart of any innovation, why does the world not have this? What if the world did have this? How do we get the world to have this? And so it really talks about the art of inquiry as a way to better understand, to fuel curiosity and to innovate and create better solutions. 00:47:15 [Speaker Changed] I love that name. I’m gonna have to check that out. Let’s talk streaming. What are you watching or listening to these days? Oh gosh. Netflix, Amazon podcasts. Tell us what’s keeping you entertained? 00:47:25 [Speaker Changed] So I have this, this barbell approach. I, I go, I love reality tv. Oh really? Below Deck. Do you watch Below Deck? 00:47:32 [Speaker Changed] No, but I know plenty of people who 00:47:34 [Speaker Changed] Do. Oh so good. But that’s kind of one side of it. The other side of it is I like Intensity. So like Mayor of Kingstown, I’m watching Terminal List Dark Wolf right now. I think that’s on Amazon. It is very good. Basically Chris Pratt, is it? Yes. Navy Seal, term C, A operative. 00:47:53 [Speaker Changed] Very, very good. Very interesting, right? Yeah. Yeah. We just finished Killing Eve. 00:47:58 [Speaker Changed] Oh, I haven’t started yet, which was 00:48:00 [Speaker Changed] My wife watched it, loved it, and said you have to watch this. And she rewatched it with me, if you like that sort of high intensity espionage. Really great cast. Great. Really strong recommend. So our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in retirement services, wealth management, investing? How would you advise them? 00:48:26 [Speaker Changed] So I go back to my way, my entry into this industry. I didn’t know the first thing about anything. I didn’t think I wanted to be in this industry, but I went in with open eyes and I asked a lot of questions. And in some ways it was like because I didn’t have the experience, it made it easier for me to be just like an everyday person that we were trying to serve. And so I say, come into this industry, you don’t need a traditional background. In fact, I prefer people not to have a traditional background of finance or econ come into this industry and help us make it better. 00:48:55 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Love that. And our final question, what do you know about the world of wealth management? Retirement services investing today would’ve been useful 25 years or so ago when you were first getting started? 00:49:08 [Speaker Changed] I was really fortunate to have my father tell me that the first thing I needed to do when I got a job was start saving in an IRA and in my 401k. And even when it hurt to do, I did it. I wish I had known back then that I could have been saving in many different ways. I could have been investing in many different ways, right? And so, you know, to anyone who’s out there thinking about are they saving enough or investing enough, the answer is probably no. And you should do more. And there’s so many ways to do it. You can use a financial advisor, you can go direct, you can do it in many different ways, but just do it. Just start. That’s something I would’ve done. Huh. 00:49:42 [Speaker Changed] Really, really good advice. Thank you, Jamie, for being so generous with your time. We have been speaking with Jamie Majera. She’s head of BlackRock’s US Wealth Advisory service, as well as head of BlackRock’s retirement business.

This was first on deck from last night and Alastair did not disappoint. Last night Greenwald was back to soft pedal the outrage over Tucker’s speech at the Charlie Who memorial. GG holds that he didn’t say what I heard him to say. The genie is out of the bottle. Oh, Alice X, how times have changed. I remember back in the last century when I loved waking up on Wednesday mornings because that was the day that the NYT’s then food guy, “minimalist” Mark Bittman, printed (yes, PRINT) his easy, fast and delicious recipes. Now it’s Monday, when I wake up, eager, as you say, to ‘take in the day’s latest batch of fresh hell,’ and put on my headphones to listen to Alastair Crooke as I scrub down the kitchen. >Last night Greenwald was back to soft pedal the outrage over Tucker’s speech at the Charlie Who memorial. GG holds that he didn’t say what I heard him to say. The genie is out of the bottle. This bit? And it it actually reminds me of my favorite story ever. So, it’s about 2,000 years ago in Jerusalem and Jesus shows up and he starts talking about the people in power and he starts doing the worst thing that you can do, which is telling the truth about people and they hate it and they just go bonkers. They hate it and they become obsessed with making him stop. This guy’s got to stop talking. We’ve got to shut this guy up. And I can just sort of picture the scene in a lamp lit room with a bunch of guys sitting around eating hummus thinking about what do we do about this guy telling the truth about us? We must make him stop talking. And there’s always one guy with the bright idea and I could just hear him say, “I’ve got an idea. Why don’t we just kill him? That’ll shut him up. That’ll fix the problem.” It doesn’t work that way. https://youtubetotranscript.com/transcript?v=yUwocghazRc I was amazed he went there. I am doubly amazed however that my Zionist friends in my friend feed are silent. HTML on the Steve Vladek link is not quite right – for readers, the post is well worth pasting into your browser. “Trump’s Bagram Folly” I think that Wukchumni called it when he said that idiotic statements like Trump wanting Bagram is just a distraction from the fact that Trump still refuses to release the Epstein files. I don’t think that even his base believes him when he says that they don’t exist and are just a Democrat hoax.

It’s a remarkable grove in that the highest altitude Sequoias grow there @ 9,000 feet, about 3,000 feet higher than usual, and it also sports around a dozen trees over 300 feet high, not to mention perhaps the oldest Sequoia of all-the Arm Tree, at least 3,000 years old. https://sequoiaquest.com/atwell-mill-arm-tree-tour-6212019.html There is one route in via the Paradise Trail, otherwise its all steep off-trail walking to get to the holy grail. In a dozen years of traipsing around in such a fashion with friends, we’ve never met another hiker en route off-trail, so it very much feels like your very own grove of Brobdingnagians, most of which in the higher climes are around 20 feet wide at eye level. The western edge of the grove experienced effects of the KNP Fire in 2021, with the Diamond Tree (19th biggest and 12 feet higher than the Sherman Tree) bearing the brunt of the activity, as flames raced through it’s base and carved a conflagration tunnel about 2 feet wide for 150 feet straight up, with the break-out point where the aged marquise diamond shaped fire scar that gives it the name, is. A mere mortal tree would succumb, but Sequoias can take such a beating and keep on living. Before: https://sequoiaquest.com/diamond.html After: https://sequoiaquest.com/atwell-mill-may-2022.html It’s difficult not to feel like a big nothing-a pipsqueak, in their presence. Frankly I was seriously impressed with that Hyperion tree. It’s massive. However Wikipedia says- ‘The exact location of Hyperion is nominally secret but is available via internet search. However, in July 2022, the Redwood Park superintendent closed the entire area around the tree, citing “devastation of the habitat surrounding Hyperion” caused by visitors. Its base was trampled by the overuse and as a result ferns no longer grow around the tree.’ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(tree) Coastal Sequoias are basketball players, and Sierra Sequoias are sumo wrestlers… Trees on the coast are in a maze of rainforest, as coastal fog supplies the wherewithal, as opposed to Sierra groves, where in a group effort, they really don’t allow much to grow in their midst and are oh so approachable. I felt as if I was killing something with every step when we were in Redwood NP. When one is in Redwood National Park on California’s north coast, it can be sobering to remember that 95% of these trees were cut down. Cities in the area have names tied to this history. Mill Valley had saw mills and Corte Madera means “cut wood”. From the perspective of the redwood forest, freedom from government regulation was hardly a positive. The Kauri tree in NZ also suffered from being a great hardwood and relatively easy to get to, and 95% of what I’d term a shorter white-bark Sequoia were cut down. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agathis_australis No offense but think I prefer basketball to sumo. But all trees are magnificent. Redwoods do have more media presence–that atmospheric scene in Vertigo. If you walk out your back door to the south fork entrance and take the trail to the top of Dennison Ridge you will find a nice little grove at very close to 9000 feet. Very remote and probably seldom visited, an extension of the Garfield grove. Think I’ve been to the area you’re talking about and the Atwell Grove and Garfield Grove are kind of bookends of high altitude Giant Sequoias, one south facing and one north facing. I have only walked to Hockett Meadow once from the South Fork, as somebody has to pay the price for gaining 5,000 vertical feet. My preferred way is to backpack from Mineral King to Hockett and then walk down the Garfield Grove, where experiencing it is more pleasurable as its literally all downhill. Camping spots are at a premium on the Garfield Trail, but we stumbled onto a beauty in the upper grove, a few hundred feet off-trail hidden away, with a large circle of around a dozen boulders of size and surrounded by 20 foot wide Sequoias, with a view across of Homers Nose. It’s a dry camp, with water being about 400 feet up the trail at a creek-so mossies aren’t on ya as much. I saw written on a topo map in the Hockett Meadow ranger’s station ‘Stonehenge’ for the name of the place, and fitting. Here’s a trip report from the last time I saw the King Arthur Tree alive, a year before the Castle Fire burned it up real good. I might have been the last person to see it alive-the 9th largest living thing in the world was not an easy get. https://sequoiaquest.com/garfield-grove-919-222019.html https://sequoiaquest.com/king-arthur.html https://www.ilovetrees.net/king-arthur-dead/ I go through Mineral King to go over the gap into national forest because I don’t have to register at the ranger station and it’s a great way to access the high country by starting at 8000 feet. A great way to get to the grove I am talking about is to head south out of Hockett on the main trail and cut west across summit meadow. Continue down the ridge crest until you reach the grove. There is no trail to speak of after leaving the main trail but there is a trail out of the grove down to the south fork ranger station. Regarding the Chief Investment Officer article in AI-infrastructure investing. There is no way these numbers make any sense at all. And, if they try it will actually crowd out other investing. This is a really bad bet but all parties. Also, it means massive electricity shortages and rising power prices. Just what we need to frustrate consumers and fuel inflation. The shortest path to increasing power generation is combined cycle natural gas. If we are about to enter a period of massive construction of these plants, it seems to me we would be seeing it in the futures curve for natural gas, no? That’s because there is a waiting list of years for gas turbines. https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/electric-power/052025-us-gas-fired-turbine-wait-times-as-much-as-seven-years-costs-up-sharply Why don’t they get in touch with Iran to acquire those gas turbines? “The Forever-35 Face The face-lift is better than ever, and everybody wants one.

There was some talk of renaming Naval Air Station Lemoore-where the squadron is based, to NAS Lemon, you’d only need to change a few letters. I had trouble reading that a few days ago; the graphic descriptions of how facial surgery is performed made shudder. What a horrific sounding procedure to go through. America is such a hopelessly superficial society. And perpetual facial youth is yours for $100-300K! She’s 32???? I thought she was at least 50 The H1B is framed as indians stealing American jobs, but it could also be framed as India subsidizing the US education system. Though as far as I know, nobody is doing that. Maybe our elites concluded that it’s no longer necessary for India to train American workers, as they believe that AI is going to take over all of the jobs. Really a question of extent to which H1B workers supply missing skills (the subsidize education argument) or replace skilled workers with cheaper alternatives (the stealing jobs argument). My view is that it is mostly but not entirely the latter. The former tend to be highly compensated so at least conceptually a tariff makes some sense, as companies will accept the cost to get truly missing skills, while killing the labor arbitrage of the average worker. The real ‘benefit’ of H1B’s and other guest worker visa’s isn’t necessarily that they are cheaper, but that it creates an indentured servant class that can be treated like garbage. Even in cases H1B’s cost more than an American worker, they might still be preferred by the business class because they get a workforce that’s more compliant and easier to simply discard. Ian Welsh makes that point in his latest piece on the subject: Why Trump’s 100K H-1B Visa Fee Won’t Work & How To Make It Work So, I’ve long had issues with H-1B Visas, and all types of guest-worker visas. Not only do they take jobs from natives, in many cases (but not all), they create a class of workers with limited rights. Bosses don’t just want guest workers because they are cheaper and drive down wages, but because they can be mistreated. No job, no visa, and the time to find a new one is short: sixty days in the case of H1-Bs. Even if the response isn’t to simply offshore the desired talent, the problem remains that the desired (experienced) talent may not be available in USA. Look at the fighting over AI gurus. Overlooked in all of this (I’ve yet to see a single media story mention it) is the fact that companies are still free to sponsor workers for employment-based green cards. The only drawbacks it has compared to H-1B is that it’s more expensive (not any more, with H-1Bs at $100k) and that once it’s approved, it gives the worker the same employment rights as a US citizen or resident. So all the crocodile tears about not being able to get foreign workers are just that. They can still get foreign workers, just not indentured ones. Here’s my anecdata for consideration: At my last two firms (global financial institutions), H1B workers that had attended US institutions – lower or higher education — were few and far between, other than those working in front-office, technically sophisticated areas (e.g., quant trading). That group typically had doctorates in technical fields – physics, math, etc, from the top US institutions (or, rarely, France). Of the H1Bs holding only a foreign undergrad degree a very few were pursuing graduate degrees at local colleges (e.g., Columbia, NYU) while also working. Within my department of 32, of 7 H1B workers only 2 had undergrad degrees from a US college. In 20+ years of hiring for junior staff in the finance world (in a complex but not in highly advanced area), I have generally found the H1B bachelors-holding applicants to be about equal in skills to US citizens with bachelors degrees. There’s a lot of variance in that lot, the brilliant and the morons being about equally distributed. The H1Bs are a bit less clued in to the larger American/Western culture, but I was hiring to get a finance job done, not to discuss the plot line of Emma Bovary. I think there’s a strong argument to be made that the H1B should be restricted to only advanced degree holders, working directly in their degree field – physics PhDs should not be eligible for a visa to work on finance problems, no matter that trading activity could be modeled (and exploited) by applying physics properties. It can be argued that the truly skilled quant personnel can enter under O visas like actors and musicians. I would be happy to see H1-B visas (and really any other “work” visas beyond those needed for very high level collaboration work) to go away altogether. It’s a brain drain for the labor exporter country and drives down wages for US domestic work force. And BBC literally admits that Experts say pay data shows why Trump’s new $100,000 fee is unworkable. In 2023, the median salary for new H-1B employees was $94,000, compared with $129,000 for those already in the system. Since the fee targets new hires, most won’t even earn enough to cover it, say experts. If these are truly the best, elite people, how is they’re getting paid an average of $94K? Like, for reals? This doesn’t pass the smell test; never has. ‘It’s a brain drain for the labor exporter country and drives down wages for US domestic work force.’ I think that might have been the plan. Much like China, it can be hard to step back and realize that it’s really the American capitalists and the Indian capitalists that are screwing their collective workers. On balance I think Indian workers probably come out a bit ahead, though. Looking at the supposedly intent of H1B, though, it is telling that the overwhelming majority of H1B holders are from India, followed by China as a distant second; It cannot really be that the world’s best and brightest reside mostly in India in such an overwhelming proportion. The program has been heartily abused as a wage suppression scheme for decades. It’s not complicated. The difference between Indian and Chinese H1-B visa holders is the English language. Indians ALL speak excellent English … better than many native Americans. Slightly different accent so many Americans insist the Indians’ English proficiency is, well … not as good (much less superior) to their own. And this simplification explains Experts say pay data shows why Trump’s new $100,000 fee is unworkable. In 2023, the median salary for new H-1B employees was $94,000, compared with $129,000 for those already in the system. Since the fee targets new hires, most won’t even earn enough to cover it, say experts. Superior skills would generally imply, at least in capitalist America, superior pay. It is not in evidence however. And regardless of even that, there’s been plenty of excellent investigative reporting demonstrating quite clearly how body shops game the H1B system to import workers to replace Americans. This is the overwhelming usage of the system today, as documented extensively. Young Chinese all take 9+ years of English. Many of them speak excellent colloquial English and are even better on reading and writing. I think the difference is that almost all Indian high achievers aspire to leave India for North America, Australia, or the UK. Chinese high achievers are increasingly choosing to stay in China for education and work.

Union Pacific – Norfolk Southern merger UP-NS merger ‘sounds good to me,’ Trump says Train magazine Trump met with UP Chief Executive Jim Vena last week in the Oval Office, when he first expressed support for the Omaha-based company’s acquisition of NS, headquartered in Atlanta. STB Criteria is serve the Public interest and enhance competition, huh? Looks like a rubber stamp to me. Trump met with UP Chief Executive Jim Vena last week in the Oval Office, when he first expressed support for the Omaha-based company’s acquisition of NS, headquartered in Atlanta. Trains Matthew K. Rose, who retired as BNSF Railway’s executive chairman in 2019, says the UP-NS merger would be a train wreck for President Donald Trump’s reindustrialization efforts … Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads have proposed a merger — what could possibly be wrong with a transcontinental railroad? First, there exists no financial crisis in the rail industry, like that which drove the significant consolidation in the freight rail industry over the last 30 years. The proposed merger is driven by management and a micro-minority of activist stockholders, not for the benefit of shippers, employees, or even most investors. Second, risk of merger integration and ongoing operational failures of a nationwide rail network is significant. Transcontinental railroads, given their size, are too big to run but not too big to fail. Finally, the merger puts industrial and commodity shippers at a disadvantage — the very U.S. industries that President Donald Trump is seeking to promote. Let me explain… Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) has been asset stripping for 15 years now. Employment down 33%, ripped up yards and trackage. Freight volumes have flat-lined since mid 2000s, while trucking is up 30% Railroads have a 40% margin. Wall Street and executives compensated with stock are the ONLY beneficiaries of consolidation. Customers, the public and environment are the lovers. The only positive is consolidation makes nationalization easier in the future. Railroads should be a public asset and not a plaything for billionaires. Reading Eric Hobsbawm’s The Age of Revolution right now which is written from a Marxist viewpoint. Apparently the US was one if the very few Western countries whose railroads were not nationalized from the get-go.

Was in Hong Kong for a coin show when Ike rolled into town, and what a performance. I was on the 17th floor of the Holiday Inn in Kowloon, part of me wanted to watch the proceedings from a window, and another part of me wanted to lay in the bathtub sans water, and lock the bathroom door-just in case. The latter strategy won out. It felt like a continual 4.1 earthquake for an hour, quite unsettling. The next day, junks were 100 yards inland along with other boatalities scattered to and fro, bamboo which was used rather exclusively for scaffolding, was shredded similar to shredded wheat, and bamboo is no shrinking violet. I’ll take earthquakes instead… I guess that when you are used to earthquakes that only last a few seconds, that it would be extremely unnerving being in a swaying tower for over an hour. Reading up on Typhoon Ike, it was a monster- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Ike Some earthquakes last over a minute, but what makes them so long is how time slooowws down the more you while in your chair dances around the floor. Those seconds feel like minutes and for those few quakes that do last minutes, I imagine that they do feel like they last hours. Also, if you’re in a serious quake zone (e.g. Sumatra) the thought that gets me is “this is minor right now, but could get really destructive”. Never felt so small. When I lived in Banda Aceh there are noticeable earthquakes every few days. After a while of this our brains kept “feeling” non-existent quakes. Ended up keeping a glass of water on the table so we could check for ripples. No fan of wind, but would take it over quakes. A glass of water on a table can give a warning about other things as well- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25udaa-Wn4E When those little orange tiger cubs grow up will they always play nice with their human hosts and handlers?

NATO Ramps Up for War with Russia” ‘…the NATO members genuinely believe that they enjoy military superiority over Russia and are proposing a range of crazed responses to alleged Russian provocations, such as shooting down Russian combat aircraft and closing the Baltic Sea to Russian maritime traffic.’ These are known as acts of war and I doubt even Trump will intervene if some of these eastern NATO members try a stunt like this. I keep on getting the impression that these countries are saying stupid stuff like this because they are absolutely convinced that Trump will ride to their rescue, even if it means triggering WW3. Since the Pentagon recently announced that they are pulling weaponry and resources out of the Baltic States, that is not a bet that I would take. > Sinclair preempts Jimmy Kimmel Live! after ABC’s decision to reinstate.

Wolfgang Munchau: The war cheerleaders need to go back to the mindset I had in the 1980’s. War in central Europe was (and is) a tripwire for nuclear war! Recall of the horrors of WW II was gone in my view. Vietnam and the limits of US power were in play! Ground Launched Cruise Missiles and Pershings (nuclear tipped all) in Europe. The war cheerleaders need to recognize the limits of US power to project against a first world power within its geography. They also need to recognize their own limits. The fact that sanctions were wrong was obvious: long term trade benefits both sides. G7 is slowing in part because they shot themselves in the feet with sanctions. Anyone with eyes and Econ 101 would see! They should all pull up Nena’s “99 Red Balloons” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpu5a0Bl8eY&list=RDFpu5a0Bl8eY&start_radio=1 Those cheerleaders could also try a little harder to explain what victory in a NATO-Russia conflict looks like to them in both the nuclear and nonnuclear cases. Anyone using the word “Putin” in the answer should explain how Russian security interests change when he’s gone or else own up that they really want something like the prostrate Yeltsin client state selling everything they can for pennies on the dollar. Extreme economic and political instability in Russia is a desirable strategic goal? You mentioned the sanctions. If the US top goal for Project Ukraine was to gather its European vassals back, domineer them, extract tribute, and sever their relations with the East then so far it looks like it has worked. Breaking up Russia is unspoken U.S./UK/Berlin/Brussels goal. Not explicitly written in print media – (because they all know to officially demand Russia´s break-up would be against international law which by design only Russians are capable of violating) – but tacitly understood by editors and readers and politicians alike. One of those lovely Bourdieu-esque cultural demoninators among elites. It is contradictory that in this article, Munchau, while correctly identifying the warmongers still buys their propaganda and the “unacceptable aggresions” by Russia and tries “not to underpin the security threat posed by Vladimir Putin”. This security threat is, in it’s entirety, a creation of the CW and expanded even more by the European warmongers themselves. It is real because it exists in the minds of those who so rabidly want war with Russia but it would dissipate as soon as the sanctions-obsessed warmongers were substituted by more rational actors with a will to restore relationships instead. Does he try, with this contradiction, not to be sidelined completely by the very same propagandist warmongers he is criticising? If so I think it is illusory for Munchau to believe that he can stand in some kind of middle way. He must be either with them in every sense or totally against them because the warmongers themselves will demand it. I think this explains what he writes his last phrase: “They leave me in no doubt that there is substantial support for a glorious war, just as there was over 100 years ago” and omits the corollary “and this support might end with the same tragic consequences”. Munchau tries, somehow cowardly, not to compromise too much. Regarding the Dr. Goebbels, article from 1938, (A nice example of cancel culture rom the past.) the kind doctor’s rhetoric sounds familiar. brazen, impertinent, arrogant and tactless… society rabble that followed them with thundering applause—parasitic scum, inhabiting our luxury streets, that seems to have only the task of proving with how little brains people can get along and even acquire money and prominence As does this observation from the author, What amused the public most, however, and presumably roiled the National Socialist authorities most—although Dr. Goebbels does not mention it—is that they deftly, but unmistakably, caricatured some gestures, poses and physical characteristics of National Socialist leaders—sometimes with bon mots that made the rounds of the country. Terrorist bon mots! “‘We’ve given up on Israel’: Disillusioned with Netanyahu and the war in Gaza, Israelis are fleeing” Maybe this lot is smarter than I figured. That sooner or later Netanyahu would start attacking those on the left as outcasts in order to secure his own position.

As a cynical American conditioned to listen for war drums, financial stabilization is not my first thought when I see a US official use that line in reference to international affairs. Are we sure this isn’t Act II of a flanking maneuver on the southern cone as the US war machine repositions for Monroe Doctrine 2.0? Argentina is probably too far to be of any assistance with the war on Venezuela but lots of water and minerals in Argentina. I believe that many people are attending or watching memorials for Kirk with real feeling, but spontaneous and impromptu are not accurate. The well-funded bots and monied efforts on all the socials (including YouTube) and throughout the internet, never mind FOX news and bots in place to create conflict, did so much to foment the mood, along with the White House. (Although I suspect Trump is pretty steamed about now with all the admiration for Kirk.) It’s exhausting. For a while there the Kirk-bot posts outpaced “thank you, RFK, Jr!” Bots.

This week the Moon of Alabama blog will, hopefully, move onto a new blogging system and a new hosting service. I have tried to prepare for the move to be as smooth as possible. However – experience says that any such move hardly ever happens without severe hick-ups. This will take all the time I have and, until the move is done, there will be few if any new posts. At some point I will close the comments on the old side and open them on the new one. I will then change the name-server entries to direct all requests for moonofalabama.org to the new physical server. This changeover will take some time to proliferate throughout the distributed global Domain Name Service (DNS). If you are experiencing problems reaching Moon of Alabama just wait a while, maybe even a day, and try again. Since Typepad announced its close down its service has deteriorated. Some blog functions have stopped working and the help desk has become unresponsive. It may therefore take some time to put the complete archives onto the new server. The last two or three weeks of posts and comments will, at first, likely be missing. I will try to correct that as soon as possible but will depend on Typepad to be able to do this. I’ll see you at the new site …” – ‘On Gaza & Ukraine: Canadian PM Mark Carney is either a fool or a Deep State operative’ – Lucy Komisar This is a nice critique of the type of bulls**t rhetoric coming from Western leaders these days. But I’m not sure I’d call Carney either a fool or a Deep State operative. When your Prime Minister is the former Governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, it tells me that elites don’t even have to pretend any more that you are a “democracy” of all the people. It’s as if billionaires in the US just started running for elective office directly rather than funding “regular” candidates secretly… oh wait. Oligarchs don’t have to pretend we have a democracy anymore. Nor do they have to pretend that their words have any relation to facts. It’s all just for show these days. Trudeau gets replaced by this guy. Biden gets replaced by Trump. Nothing fundamentally changes. On Gaza & Ukraine: Canadian PM Mark Carney is either a fool or a Deep State operative They are not mutually exclusive, you know!

(or main page has a link in the ‘trending’ column). Thank you! I had to address the corn syrup vs sugar story. I quit drinking all sodas over 10 years ago due to corn syrup. I realize sugar isn’t good either, but in general avoid all products containing corn syrup. I do not eat anything with corn syrup in the product, I found it in campbells tomato soup and Italian sausage. I found it in all sorts of products and just classify it as processed food. I have found many alternatives and try to eat as organic as possible. If I do choose a soft drink, I try to stick to diet but wonder if sugar might still be a better choice than whatever chemical compound the diet soda might have in it. So all the hysteria relative to corn syrup was just nonsense? Really? Yes. With sodas, the colorings are at least as bad as the sugars. Aspartame has more complaints than any other food additive approved by the FDA by a huge margin, yet oddly RFK, Jr. is not interested in that. Coincidence? “Incidentally, the Dirty Money website shows that the company Fanjul runs with his brother Pepe, Florida Crystals, donated $1 million last year to the super-PAC known as Make America Great Again Inc. You can probably guess which grotesque presidential candidate it supported.” Florida Phoenix Many of the artificial sweeteners have been found to be cancer-causing. We switched to flavored carbonated water and like it pretty well. “I Took Bernie Into Deep Trump Country. Can He Win Them Over?” Bernie won nearly every county in Upstate NY that went for Trump. The reason why in retrospect at latest Bernie gotta seriously ask himself why he did not risk a rift in the DNC back in 2016 and 2020. I am not pink-glassed re: Bernie (in Germany he would have been a Merkel-man). But by comparison… Because he needed ballot access. The rules in many states for new parties are insanely restrictive. I understand the reason why he did not run third party, as the chances of a third-party candidate ever being successful are impossible the way that the ballot laws are intentionally-written. However, a lot of people are very bitter (Myself included) over the fact that he did not take Biden to task as he and the rest of the Democratic Party so richly deserved and instead groveled before the very establishment that was blatantly trying to cheat him and as a result, we got stuck with his “friend” Joe Biden. At the very least, he could openly point out how dishonest the leadership of the DNC is and how they are just as much of an obstacle to taking on the plutocratic oligarchy as the Republicans are. I understand that he was afraid of a Trump victory at the time, so he tried to foster “party unity” among the Democratic Party. He still got a proverbial kick in the teeth from them after doing so. The problem is that Sanders does not seem to realize that the Democratic Party as a whole, particularly the Clintonite wing is never going to forgive him no matter what he does for daring to challenge Hillary’s claim to the throne in 2016, so there is no point in trying to appease members of the Democratic nomenklatura who are going to hate him no matter what he does. He should have given them no quarter, because they certainly did not give him any. Only after you are victorious should you consider extending the proverbial olive branch. Indeed. I give him a pass for 2016 – he did make a pledge ahead of time to support the eventual nominee, and he kept it even after he got screwed. That shows integrity. But given that, when they stuck the knife in again in 2020, he should have gone scorched earth. Yeah. The part that got me was barely acknowledging the multiple efforts made to successfully sabotage both his campaigns. I get ‘16 for the same. He made a pledge, kept his word.

Family members have appealed to Elon Musk for help. Shutdown theater continues: Trump says no meeting with top Democrats on shutdown ‘could possibly be productive’ President Donald Trump on Tuesday appeared to cancel a planned meeting this week with the two top Democrats in Congress, just days before the federal government is set to shut down. Trump had been scheduled to meet with Senate and House Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries sometime this week, CNBC and other news outlets reported. “After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. This year is pretty lit. Meanwhile on Priced out of traditional housing, more Americans are living in RVs Out here, we have a ton of RVs, but these seem to be much more affluent or at least reasonably well off RV owners. They’re here for half the year, the other half elsewhere, many it appears in Florida. These aren’t the newly poor(er). PE buying up RV parks has been a big these these past 10 or 15 years. This is definitely a growth area for exploitation. I can’t get WSJ, but this is similar U.S. lawmakers push for military dialogue in a rare China visit (NPR) I pretty much take it as a given that a parked 5th wheel trailer in a driveway is never going on vacay again, thanks to somebody living full time in it. Theater, indeed … of the Japanese “Kabuki” variety. Only the lonely Thomas Massie had the integrity to point out that a CR simply restores the funding to USAID and other agencies that Musk allegedly “wood chippered” back to Biden-era levels. So, should a CR pass, expect a massive hiring spree at NGO’s and NGO adjacents, such as Business Insider, Forbes, and Politico (beneficiaries of USAID largesse.) Gotta crank out those Goebbels-style propaganda pieces … they won’t write themselves! Ukraine is winning, Gaza isn’t genocide, etc. Or maybe they will write themselves, thanks to AI. Only a fool would ever think that the GOP is in favor of spending cuts. The end result will be a few days of shutdown theater, followed by a CR and more spending than last year, as always. I assume this is all about dollar shorts and gold / silver puts. Is everything broken? 1) I ordered two identical ceiling fans from an online website. They shipped in two different packages. The first one arrived. The second one didn’t. I checked the tracking website and saw that the second package was stuck in a distribution center in Texas. I called the shipping company and they tried to trace the package. A couple of days later I received an email that the package was lost and I needed to contact the vendor. The vendor said they would ship a replacement. I specifically told the vendor that I had ordered two, received one, and it was just the one that was missing. I got an email from the vendor that the replacement was ordered, but I noticed that the vendor ordered two fans. I called the vendor and explained that I had already received one. I was told they would try to stop one from shipping, but it was probably too late. They verified that, yes, I had informed them that I only needed one replacement. I ended up getting two replacement fans from the vendor. Then a couple of days later, the shipper evidently found the “lost” package and sent it. So, I ended up with four ceiling fans. I called the vendor and they said I could ship them back if I wanted to and they would email prepaid shipping label. I never received the shipping label. I guess I will donate them to Habitat for Humanity. 2) I ordered two different “Wicked” t shirts for a family member who is a “Wicked” fan. They were sent in two different packages. The first one was what i ordered, the second one was a Harry Potter t shirt with no tags — it looked like it had been a return. I called the vendor and I was told a replacement would be sent. I specifically told them which one I had received and which one needed to be replaced. I got the shipment and ended up receiving the t shirt I already had. 3) I ordered a pair of jeans from an online retailer. The manufacturer had two labels with a smaller size than what I ordered. However, the retailer puts its own sticker on the item that indicated a different (right) size. So I ended up with the smaller (wrong) size. I give up,. Yes Amazon? No. If you itemize your deductions, be sure to also take the deduction for your fan donation :-) Are stolen items deductible? I believe he said they never sent the return UPS stickers so they are abandon items which he happens to possess. I would expect these to be deductible as he becomes the default owner. He did his diligence in trying to return them. Yup. everything is broken. Similar thing happened with a buddy, but with a large flatscreen TV. First shipment was delayed and they eventually wound up with two and the company they bought it from didn’t want the 2nd one back. This indicates to me that these companies must be operating with some substantial margins if they can be so cavalier about losing product. “This indicates to me that these companies must be operating with some substantial margins if they can be so cavalier about losing product.” I was thinking the same thing. The fan vendor told me I could just keep the two extra fans. Since I had no need for two more fans and didn’t want the hassle of selling them, I thought I would just try to return them. The two extra fans were over $300 (total, not apiece). I think some of these companies run a business with low cost of goods and higher costs for people and shipping and storage. Somehow it’s cheaper for them to abandon physical goods than to bring them back, clean them up and repackage them. We’ve had a few experiences like this where when we received lightly damaged goods (dented metal) they just sent us a new one without asking for a return of the damaged one. Quality control on soda has gone down; I’ve had more damaged or even leaking cans than I’ve ever had before, although the number I can count on a single hand. Nonetheless, I’d never seen this before in decades of addiction until post 2020. Rice cakes as well, they’re more likely to be not entirely formed. Quaker Oats never seemed to have this issue prior to 2020. They were mostly always perfectly formed. Secret Service dismantles telecom threat around UN capable of crippling cell service in NYC | CNBC Forensic analysis is still in its early stages, but agents believe nation-state actors — perpetrators from particular countries — used the system to send encrypted messages to organized crime groups, cartels and terrorist organizations, McCool said. Authorities have not disclosed details on the specific government or criminal groups tied to the network at this point. About a decade ago I was doing a lot of regular business travel to NYC and noticed an immediate degradion in my cell service especially with images. It was so bad I had a recurring joke with my friends that NYPD had a geofence around Manhattan to slurp up racy pictures and texts and that was why my messages would take multiple retries to send. Wonder how long this install has been in place? So nation state actors, but they aren’t blaming Russia?!!!?? Hmmm, what other nation state has shown a proclivity for using telecom devices for nefarious purposes? I wonder why authorities aren’t offering any suggestions here, normally they are very quick to assign blame whether the facts are there or not. This reminds of that story about the mysterious drones over NJ that we never got an answer to – we probably won’t here either. Hmmm, what other nation state has shown a proclivity for using telecom devices for nefarious purposes? Lol yeah also my first thought. So when they got to the part about cartels it sounded very unlikely. But I like another commenter’s suggestion down thread that it could have been used for comment swarming/consent manufacturing “China Rare Earths Issue Remains Unresolved, US Lawmaker Says” Bit unsporting of the Chinese to refuse to sell refined earths to ultimately the Pentagon so that they can be used to build weaponry to be eventually used against China. The whole thing is ironic as there is an outbreak of peace in the Pacific right now simply because at the moment the US does not have the wherewithal to militarily confront China. China would be wise to keep this as a trump card (no pun intended.) For example: “Oh, so you say you want us to stop buying Russian oil … too bad about those rare earths, Donald.” “Oh, so you say you will slap tariffs on us if we don’t buy Boeing … too bad about those rare earths, Donald.” Perhaps Bessent and Lutnick could something something blockchain the rare earths? StableGallium? re: Germany’s death wish – not fit for war, but addicted to war I am known to be part of that faction that doubts any of the war threats by EU are serious. Hadn´t RU attacked no PR office in Berlin and Brussels could have come up with a more brilliant strategy to rule and extort. For them this was gold. Again: Why put all this to danger after it was given to them on a silver plate? Allegedly so far numbers of those joining Bundeswehr have risen by 15%. After 4 years of this? That´s not much. Especially if you consider how little that is in absolute seize. Also keep in mind that Germany already had a huge standing army. So nothing of this is new. Even, to my knowledge, the planned Tomahawks 2026 are not new and thus not faster than what we had here before (the system is 40 years old). What is faster is the Russian response and in case those Dark Eagles do fly one day which they do not on a reliable scale yet. I am not trying to downplay. But I firmly believe that crunching serious economic and military numbers and challenge the war parties that would open up a revealing debate in the sense of: “Mr. Merz, do you really want war with RU? If so, then you have to do this and this and this and turn Germany into the Fourth Reich. Do what the Nazis did. And then you loose either the planet (because nobody will survive WWIII) or you loose the country´s wealth for building a useless military.” And quickly the emperor would loose his clothes. But the peace movement for lack of competence shies away. And thus unwillingly protects the status quo and its parties. It’s just the Krauts being Krauts again. Liberal democracy was the Nixon mask they hid their sneaky Nazi streak behind and it’s now been discarded as they reach the starting post for third time unlucky. As one of the many Brits who lost kin in the last century, the right side is the one Krautenburg isn’t on. I think that this is one of the most important stories posted above: EU and German government sanction German journalist for critical tweets about Chancellor Merz. It gives us the real taste of the Fourth Reich. Being generous, you are painting with quite the broad brush here. >It’s just the Krauts being Krauts again. Liberal democracy was the Nixon mask they hid their sneaky Nazi streak behind This doesn’t fit with my experience living in Germany and knowing many Germans. It anything, they are much more aware of the dangers of fascism. > As one of the many Brits who lost kin in the last century, the right side is the one Krautenburg isn’t on. As a Brit, I am consistently ashamed at the magnitude of British war crimes and colonial and post-colonial evil. I am ashamed of what we have done in recent years to Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya etc etc. We Brits have much blood on our hands, and IMO are in no position to lecture the Germans. Not to mention Mr Starmer’s continuing drift into authoritarianism. The Krauts may be aware of fascism because liberal democracy has failed and the country is getting bsck to normal, the sheep meekly following German “leaders” authoritarian Nazi flecked anti-slav leaders in Berlin and Brussels with Eastern ambitions. Now they want to stretch the Fourth Reich to Russia to steal its resources. Just business as usual. Fortunately, for the rest of us, they lack the strategic genius which gave Hitler his initial victories in Western Europe and Poland, but they’ve inherited his dumbest decision by taking on Russia at a game the Russians now plays better than any other country. As a Brit, I’m fully aware that the Brits are prepared to do a lot of dirty jobs and we did get a lot of blood on our hands defending British interests. Unfortunately, we now have leaders who seem to prefer folliowing the Krautberg agenda in the Ukraine and Israel but, hopefully, things might improve when the Labour party dumps the bootlicking Der Starmer and then proceeds to rip itself apart giving Reform and Your Party a chance to replace deadbeat Labour and the clapped out Tories and seize the opportunities offered by sterling and concentrate on developing trade relations with Russia and the other BRICS countries. Oooh my better half is a huge Sauerkraut fan. Better I keep this post secret ;-) OT p.s. on 1940 – Currently am reading military history “Blitzkrieg-Legende, Der Westfeldzug 1940” by Karl-Heinz Frieser. I recommend it. Although Frieser claims – in a real side show in this case – that Halder did an excellent job in portraying the Wehrmacht (however the Western campaign) as head of the Operational History German Section, which is however known to have manipulated history re: USSR. But Frieser does give interesting and detailed insight into how Manstein and that Sichelschnitt attack plan came together against Halder, later due to Halder, and it was risky, i.e. it could have failed. As to “genius” the jury is still out to whether or not the French on a longterm planning level did sabotage their own capabilities in the sense that most parties of the formative French elites undermined the 3rd Republic and yearned for a subordination under German-ruled EU. The fact that French air forces, army and even tanks were larger in numbers at least than German, the fact that at least in PR terms France was intended to keep peace in Europe with the largest European Armed Forces still I cannot entirely discount as pure fantasy. How can you have de Gaulle suggesting tank tactics and yet have a French subterranean HQ but no phone (Gamelin instead driving to other generals by car wasting 2 hours, sometimes 2 days.) Long story short, Blitzkrieg was as much “Blitz” as the enemy let it to be. Also – this is from US scholarship – French secret intelligence knew darn well what the Germans were up to in terms of going to war. It´s absurd to assume that they were surprised. So by a rough look none of this collapse adds together… Why revert to the bigotry of former times? “Krauts” ? What disparaging racial epithet applies to you? To me? Are those epithets what we really are? Is that what you think is using your head? Maybe bertl is in need of a Jeeves… My British and Italian ancestors fought against the Germans in both world wars (the “Wop” slain at Ortona, the “Mick” made deaf in a training accident on Salisbury Plain, the “Limey” shell-shocked at Third Ypres.) They thought they were fighting for a world in which people might not be judged for what they were born as. But I suppose you’d have to be some sort of stupid Canuck to believe that, eh? Really, though, it’s not an illusion. We’re all just people: the Hun, us, everybody. So let’s cut out the crap. ‘Douglas Macgregor @DougAMacgregor THREAD: The Strategic Mutual Defense Pact (SMDP) signed between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan on September 17th signals a seismic shift in global power dynamics. Between 2020 and 2024, more than 60 percent of China’s arms exports went to nuclear-armed Pakistan. China maintains tacit support for this alliance through its deep partnership with Pakistan while simultaneously arming Iran with critical military components.’ Looks like China is really inserting itself in the Middle east and the US/NATO cannot stop them. I think the thing that is really going to push this into overdrive is how the US not only let Israel attack Qatar but shut down their air defenses to enable it. And we will see a lot more Chinese weaponry in this region too like is happening in Iran. For the countries in the Middle east, there is a new sheriff in town. Indian rupee slides to all-time low, US visa fee hike compounds pressure Reuters ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I’ve never seen an entire country so overrun with #79bugs, and old yeller going up as the Rupee is sliding, is very much a double win for those in the middle of BRICS. From Priced out of traditional housing, more Americans are living in RVs Gotta love NBC, though, in the end, RV living is just happy and working out after all Dante, who celebrated his 12th birthday in the RV, is in no rush to leave. “Before we moved, I hate to say it, but I was just a shut-in. I was inside all the time playing in my room, playing video games, doing whatever just inside,” he said. “But now I’m a lot healthier. I’ve been outside. I’ve been running around, getting some sun.” Over the past few months, he said he’s learned how to fish and cook and gotten to spend more time with his mom and sister. “I think it’s actually better than having a big house because I’ve learned a lot of stuff this summer,” he said. “I’ve learned more in three months than I have in my whole entire 11 years of being alive.” In America, even tragedy is positive! And they didn’t even get into the fact that none of these people likely can get affordable healthcare. re: Putin New Start via Dimtry Stefanovich´s TWITTER Kremlin´s statement http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/78051 “@KomissarWhipla and I wrote in @POLITICOMag before the Alaska Summit on exactly this issue.

I am probably misreading but the focus on NATO/Baltics in EU MSM right now almost appears as a clumsy attempt to divert from the sane argument by Putin on NEW START. Because how do you manage to devalue that. Except of course “Trump is a Putin stooge” etc. But in general nukes are simply nukes. No discussing that away. And you really have to stretch to make less nukes look bad. From the “Israel warns the EU” post: So, Israel has dismissed a recent recognition of a Palestinian state by several Western countries as mere political theatre. How can this move be more than a symbolic gesture and really translate into concrete actions that advances the peace process? Seriously? The “peace process” meme is still floating around out there? How is the peace process doing these days, anyway? Seems a bit down at the heels! Will the media still be asking about it when every Palestinian has been murdered and every Israeli has fled to the Ukraine or some other new homeland? I suppose there are different varieties of peace. “where they make a desert, they call it peace” Good news, department: The rapture is scheduled for today/tomorrow: https://www.statesman.com/news/article/rapture-bible-why-christians-23-tomorrow-pastor-21060773.php So, we can expect to see some Charlie Kirk supporters disappearing?

I always liked the Church of the SubGenius take on the rapture, a.k.a. “X-Day” (nominally July 5th), when the Men from Planet X arrive on Earth: “You WILL be saved — while all those a**holes FRY!” …which kinda cuts to the chase of the deep ressentiment behind longing for the rapture. RE: Trump Declares War on Left With “Domestic Terrorist” Designation Once again, the backlash to this nonsense is eminently predictable. Won’t be long before Oath Keepers and similar conservative groups get tagged as “terrorist” organizations once President Schiff is installed. Meanwhile, I welcome Trump’s war on domestic policing because antifa are cops. That will NEVER happen. The Dems are collaborators not opposition. The Dems have already been trying to tag conservatives as regime changers. See 1/6. The Trump admin is often the funhouse mirror reflection of that other funhouse mirror. The lawfare crowd were warned about blowback. Perhaps they didn’t care because now they can say told you so. Make it stop–both. re: Taibbi ICE protest uncensored Activism, Uncensored: Blocking ICE Confrontations escalate outside a facility in suburban Chicago Ford Fischer Sep 23, 2025 13 min. https://www.racket.news/p/activism-uncensored-blocking-ice I am not sure how this relates to the “Weimar” perspective, or to “Chile ´73” comparison. Police violence of this sort has been around in G7and G8 countries for decades. German police in the 1980s in fact had to change their tactics (to later ramp up their violence) because camera showed too much blood during public protests and that hurt government policies. This was all happening around anti-NPP protests. With protesters fighting cops. Being attacked from helicopters. Climbing fences. And getting beaten up. Remember the summer of Paris 1967? Or Berlin 1968? Or the death of Carlo Giuliani during the Genoa protest in the summer of 2001? I did some little reporting about Arab students in Germany in the wake of the post 9/11 Patriot Act frenzy in 2002/03. Those students lost their visa, lost their university spots, lost their jobs. They were subject to police surveillance, and general racist hysteria. I am not sure today´s left sincerely remembers the atmosphere of those years towards Muslims in general. It was ghastly. A public hysteria palpable when you walked the cities. I am having issues if Chris Hedges makes his drastic comparisons while he talks about his accompanying KLA forces. Or comparing Ukraine War with Iraq War before the fact, or talking about his dreadful experience in Latin America while making assumptions about today´s sit. I am not sure on the other hand. Indeed I am not an activist. And obviously the state lashes out against those who do push the limits. After all why fear those who do not question authority? So what is above video and what are above images about others doing videos proof of? I don´t know. But as long this “exchange” and its documentation is media reality I will keep reminding that by March 1933 – 2 months after Hitler was appointed Chancellor and at the same time the rigged 1933 elections took place – which btw still did not give NSDAP a two-third majority – NSDAP 44% vs. opposition of SPD/KPD/Zentrum 44+% – 100k people were in concentration camps subject to torture and killing, worse than Guantanamo. All this just 6 months after major newspapers in Germany had been rejoicing about the end of the NSDAP which had lost many votes in the 1932 elections and was bankrupt. p.s. when did either Taibbi, Hedges or any other knowing commentator in the US – or anyone I take seriously enough to ponder over what they are writing – last mention the problem of fascism in conjunction with Ukraine??? So we look at the “authoritarian turn” at home – which is all fine and dandy – but what about e.g. this quip from last year´s NYT, Nov. 21st? “(…)Several officials even suggested that Mr. Biden could return nuclear weapons to Ukraine that were taken from it after the fall of the Soviet Union. That would be an instant and enormous deterrent. But such a step would be complicated and have serious implications.(…)” https://archive.is/4G56L Azov dangling nukes before our cameras? Coooool. I can literally see how Kirn, here out of his depths in contrast to his excellent insight on cultural phenomena and entertainment life, would mutter some “why not?” argument just because it fancies “something daunting.” (This is provocative of course, since I am aware Kirn is bitterly opposed to WWIII provocation. But to point out the momentary contradictions inherent in ideology posing as “opinioned society”.) I have repeatedly said that Tylenol should not be sold OTC due to liver toxicity risk Why is this kind of reasoning so rare? The acetaminophen – autism link certainly doesn’t seem strong but that doesn’t mean it’s not a dangerous drug and shouldn’t be controlled more carefully. The binary approach to just about everything in our human culture is depressing. As to the Tylenol-autism link see: Tylenol and Autism from Science Based Medicine. Spoiler alert, current scientific consensus is that there is none. Science Based Medicine also has an article regarding the efficacy of prenatal vitamins in reducing the risk of autism, as well as other aspects of the condition: Autism and Prenatal Vitamins. This is but one of many SBM articles on the topic. I do take acetaminophen sparingly, for the reasons cited by Yves, because I cannot tolerate aspirin and other anti-inflammatories. My last purchase of Tylenol consisted of bright red, very sweet tablets which seem perfectly designed for children to accidentally poison themselves. From this morning, Cache of Devices Capable of Crashing Cell Network Is Found Near U.N., NYT, archived. The lede, The Secret Service discovered more than 100,000 SIM cards and 300 servers, which could disable cellular towers or be used to conduct surveillance. The tech gear is above my pay grade, but might this be a narrative construction center with a hundred thousand voices? Initial analysis of the data on some of the SIM cards has identified ties to at least one foreign nation, as well as links to criminals already known to U.S. law enforcement officials, including cartel members, Secret Service officials told reporters on Monday Curious. I don’t know what to make of this story. What if it turns out to be an off-the-books operation by the NSA or some other domestic spook operation? > NSA or some other domestic spook operation It smells more like manufacturing consent for action against a nation with ‘cartels’. If domestic, why announce it? Unless it’s an intra-spookdom fight. Can’t be Israel, as zero chance the SS exposes Bibi machinations. Whichever, it feels like another shoe needs to drop before it makes sense. In the past, a plucky little country in the Middle East embedded themselves in US telecom for some reason. I’m always amazed by the important links that no one seems to be interested in talking about here in the current commentariat… As to the upcoming decline in imports due to tariffs, this is how bad they’re expecting it to get: September will likely mark the beginning of more pronounced declines. In a September 17 presentation, the Port of Los Angeles director stated they expected inbound volume to drop 10% compared to the same month last year. Container bookings data supports this outlook, with bookings from China to the U.S. down 26% in the first week of September compared to the same period last year. Of course a shortages create their own inflation, so I think there’s going to be a very bleak Christmas this year. At least on the West Coast, my understanding is that it takes a couple more months for this situation to be reflected on the East Coast. As Yves alluded to, I’m hoping to see price drops locally. But given that we have a 22% import tax, that’s going to effect our government coffers as well. Just speaking for myself, I have become numbed by all the flip-flopping, TACO Tuesdays, and general can-kicking by the administration. How many of these tariffs are real, and how many “carve-outs” are there? I know that some of them are real, as the revenue coming in cannot be faked (well, let’s hope not.) I thought we’d be seeing riots at the local Home Depot over the last battery-powered leaf blower by Bastille Day. data center power usage I am more confused. All the media keeps saying data centers are driving up electrical prices. All the data I can find says about 25 gw of actual new electrical data center usage. And up to 80 gw by 2030 that appears to be the most commonly agreed on going forward. The US actual capacity is 1250 GW, means 2% is driving all this? Of which most is concentrated in just a few small areas? I think it’s all sloppy reporting, and the reality is that raw energy prices are going up, inflation, and tariffs for everything else. I have no love of DC or AI, but it’s not ringing true they are the reason for the large increases across the country. Gail Tverberg takes the perspective that upfront costs and amortization conflict with low demand, and income inequality is a major driver of the disparity. See the comment on turbines by windall above. It could be pricing in the future costs. Or grifting… She and Tainter are scheduled to do keynote speeches at a conference Oct 25. They both share the perspective of decreasing returns on complexity in regressing systems. Fun stuff. A follow-up: John Robb: U.S. AI data center demand is forecast to reach 123GW by 2035 (vs. just 4GW in 2024). links to: > OpenAI and NVIDIA Announce Strategic Partnership to Deploy 10 Gigawatts of NVIDIA Systems {note the phrase ‘gold-rush’ in the url} Even 123GW could be a real problem in the material world. Simple copper shortages are one node of the hydrakrisis. But with Intel.gov * Nvidia stake in Intel * Nvidia is the fulcrum of the inverted pyramid supporting the stock market, it sure looks like a national security socialization program. Where does grift end and borgenstat begin? I’ll look to what Stoller has to say on this. Busting trust, indeed. Adam Tooze, from Wednesday’s Links: > In practical terms the most important tension may be over electric power. Trump’s pivot against renewables makes no sense from a business or tech point of view. But rather than fundamentally obstructing the AI push its most likely impact is to raise costs at the margin. Don’t bet on the hyperscalers allowing the lack of windmills to get in their way. Picasso or Bitcoin? How art’s status is changing among the super-rich The Art Newspaper ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The name-brand art bubble has been something to behold and by far the best performing of all markets bubbly. To pick an example, Paul Cézanne’s ‘Portrait of Madame Cézanne’ fetched $34,500 in 1946, and last sold for $7.4 million this year. Nexstar says it will pre-empt Kimmel but maybe not forever. So this will black out the show for 1/4 of the country. Sinclair also says their block being negotiated. https://deadline.com/2025/09/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-preemption-1236553268/ https://archive.is/o8Rky#selection-447.0-447.74 Hamburger Helper nutritional values: https://www.nutritionix.com/food/hamburger-helper You don’t say? Fed Chief Powell says stock prices appear ‘fairly highly valued’ Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday noted that asset prices, a category that typically includes stocks and other risk instruments, are at elevated levels. During a speech in Providence, Rhode Island, the central bank leader was asked how much emphasis he and his colleagues place on market prices and whether they have a higher tolerance for higher values. “We do look at overall financial conditions, and we ask ourselves whether our policies are affecting financial conditions in a way that is what we’re trying to achieve,” Powell said. “But you’re right, by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued.” Powell probably knows how history treated Irving Fisher after Fisher’s “stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau” quote in Oct 1929 https://www.nytimes.com/1929/10/16/archives/fisher-sees-stocks-permanently-high-yale-economist-tells-purchasing.html Anathema – https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/breaking-news/article/mlb-announces-automated-ball-strike-system-challenges-for-2026-season-180216779.html I won’t get into all the reasons why this is just wrong, wrong, wrong (check the definition of the strike zone in the MLB rule book for starters), but I did want to highlight this bit – “Rejoice, MLB fans, robot umpires are almost here … well, kind of.” The fact that this author thinks real fans should rejoice about robots taking over says a lot. Clearly a lot of people would rather live in the Matrix than actually deal with reality. And clearly a lot of people are really stupid if they believe a robot designed by humans is going to be infallible. But as we’ve seen with polls about “AI”, the less people know about how it works, the more they trust its results. And I’m already fantasizing about MLB players going ‘office space’ on robot umpires. From last night, heh heh, Moldova’s election faces AI-driven disinformation from Russia, AP. That’s quite a headline. I’m beginning to understand why every oligarch needs a data center. Unsurprisingly, lots of “Russia, Russia, Russia!” with the usual “attributed” and “alleged”, Tidbits, Moldovan authorities have long warned that Russia is conducting a hybrid war — meddling in elections, disinformation campaigns, illicitly funding pro-Russian parties — to try to derail the country’s path toward EU membership. Moscow has repeatedly denied meddling in Moldova. Spoof websites impersonate legitimate Western media and pay “engagement farms” in Africa, while AI bots are deployed to flood comment sections deriding PAS and the EU. The obligatory clampdown, Police on Monday arrested 74 people in 250 raids as part of an investigation into an alleged Russia-backed plan to incite mass riots and destabilize the country. Anschluss in plain sight for Moldova. Brown shirt organisations springing up wherever you look. Just waiting for the uniformed groups marching around cities to intimidate everyone not sharing their views, although the marching seems to done on digital media nowadays. You don’t have to be a historian to see what is coming, plan accordingly. Trade being 60% of world GDP nowadays the economic dislocations about to occur will be off the charts. I take offense with the word Anschluss describing a potential reunification of R of Moldova with Romania. It would be the third one and hopefully luckyer. There are twice the number of “Moldovans” (ethnic Romanians from the historical principality of Moldova that united with Wallachia to form the Kingdom of Romania) in Romania than in R of Moldova and they are truly indistinguishable. We havwe the reality of divided Koreas due to the US and the reality of divided Romanians due to USSR/Russia. Of course, Brussels hates nationalism with passion, so the idea of national reunification is not in item to discus. I have been sucked into the YouTube rabbit hole in recent weeks. (I admit to avoiding politics and news as of late.) Among my suggested channels of interest are cruises, crochet and…wait for it…RV and stealth van living. I fully admit to finding the videos of how to live in one’s car, van, or modified box truck to be fascinating. And the levels at which it is being done are pretty wide ranging. Real RVs do appear to be the choice of the well off, with a few exceptions. Car living seems to be largely lower income or early in the career, with a few better off who just find it fascinating and do it part time for the challenge of both setting up a system especially for bad weather. The stealth step vans and box trucks appears to have the widest range of financial state. And those often have the most telling statements about the ability to do this. They are the ones who don’t want to or can’t afford to live in the increasingly private equity owned RV parks. And they point out that their options for being to park the vehicle are tightening and are much harder to find, both because there are so many people doing it and it freaks the businesses and people who live in the neighborhoods where they used to be able park out. This isn’t to say that the WSJ is wrong or right. Just that this anecdotal evidence is indicating that there is an increase and a response so the noose is tightening and that this is yet another alternative housing option which the traditionally homeless may not have access to much longer. I met an Ozzie years ago RVing across USA who hated it, and us. He said he couldn’t park for the night anywhere in America without someone rapping on his window, banging on the windshield, demanding to know what’s the big idea, parking here? Nothing remotely like it had ever happened in Oz. Are Americans psycho? Or are there just 20 times as many of us? I say both. re: Taibbi on Kimmel/Berenson As Jimmy Kimmel Becomes a Speech Icon, Alex Berenson Fights on Alone An imperious talk show host won the love of Hollywood and the ACLU, but to stop government pressure on companies, speech defenders need to recognize Alex Berenson https://www.racket.news/p/as-jimmy-kimmel-becomes-a-speech “Not that it matters, but while Kimmel was threatened for inaccuracy, Berenson’s problems stemmed from being too accurate about the mRNA Covid vaccines, about everything from studies showing surprising inefficacy to potential links to myocarditis that even Biden’s CDC eventually acknowledged. Critics have gone after other Berenson statements, but the ones that got him in trouble were exactly what the Founders had in mind when they thought about speech: true statements made in opposition to an official propaganda campaign. The last straw was this accurate tweet from August 28, 2021: It doesn’t stop infection. Or transmission. Don’t think of it as a vaccine. Think of it—at best—as a therapeutic with a limited window of efficacy and terrible side effect profile that must be dosed IN ADVANCE OF ILLNESS. And we want to mandate it? Insanity. Berenson’s removal marked the end of a five-month campaign that involved current and former high-level officials from Pfizer and multiple government agencies. Onetime Biden official Andy Slavitt commemorated Berenson’s silencing by posting a screenshot of Berenson’s locked account. That tweet is still live:” Does anybody know, or can explain what is meant by ” (resilc) ” used in these links? I’ve never been able to figure it out It’s a “hat tip” to the submitter of the links, giving credit. It’s my impression that parentheticals following links are hat tips to contributors. Trump really does own Ukraine General Assembly Updates: After Meeting With Zelensky at U.N., Trump Shifts Stance on Russia High as a kite man President Trump said Ukraine might be able to reclaim all its lost territory in the war against Russia. Earlier, he suggested NATO countries should shoot down Russian military aircraft that enter their airspace. Trump believes everything that Kellogg tells him – who gets all his information straight from Zelensky. So we are well past the point where it was Biden’s war and now it is Trump’s war. He now owns it lock, stock & barrel and if the Ukraine collapses, the Neocons and the main stream media will put the blame all on him. Trump’s UN speech excerpts 1) I ended seven wars. And in all cases, they were raging with countless thousands of people being killed. This includes Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda. A vicious violent war that was Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia and Armenia and Azerbaijan. 2) These are the two things I got from the United Nations. A bad escalator and a bad teleprompter. Thank you very much. And by the way, it’s working now. Just went on. Thank you. I think I should just do it the other way. It’s easier. Thank you very much. I didn’t think of it [the teleprompter] at the time because I was too busy working to save millions of lives 3) Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize for each one of these achievements. 4) What I care about is not winning prizes, it’s saving lives. 5) China and India are the primary funders of the ongoing war by continuing to purchase Russian oil. 6) But inexcusably, even NATO countries have not cut off much Russian energy and Russian energy products, which as you know, I found out about two weeks ago and I wasn’t happy. Think of it. They’re funding the war against themselves. I can tell you that they have to immediately cease all energy purchases from Russi 7) I’m announcing today that my administration will lead a international effort to enforce biological weapons convention which is going to be meeting with the top leaders of the world by pioneering an AI verification system that everyone can trust. 8) to 156) interminable ranting about green energy and immigration Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuwHEbB6uhA , https://youtubetotranscript.com/transcript?v=DuwHEbB6uhA ‘I can tell you that they have to immediately cease all energy purchases from Russia’ Does that include all the refined uranium that Trump is still buying from Russia? And the fertilizers? And the chemicals? Inquiring minds wish to now. These days I find it hard to listen to Trump talk as it is like listening to a man-child talk. I cannot bear to listen to any politician or news show, hence the use of transcripts. Even Trump transcripts strain my tolerance for idiocy. 7) I’m announcing today that my administration will lead a international effort to enforce biological weapons convention which is going to be meeting with the top leaders of the world by pioneering an AI verification system that everyone can trust.

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: Action is happening up-and-down the LLM stack: Nvidia is making deals with Intel, OpenAI is making deals with Oracle, and Nvidia and OpenAI are making deals with each other. Nine years after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hand-delivered the first Nvidia DGX-1 AI computer to OpenAI, the chip giant is investing up to $100 billion in the AI lab, which OpenAI will, of course, spend on Nvidia AI systems. This ouroboros of a deal certainly does feel a bit frothy, but there is a certain logic to it: Nvidia is uniquely dominant in AI thanks to the company’s multi-year investment in not just superior chips but also an entire ecosystem from networking to software, and has the cash flow and stock price befitting its position in the AI value chain. Doing a deal like this at this point in time not only secures the company’s largest customer — and rumored ASIC maker — but also gives Nvidia equity upside beyond the number of chips it can manufacture. More broadly, lots of public investors would like the chance to invest in OpenAI; I don’t think Nvidia’s public market investors are bothered to have now acquired that stake indirectly. The interconnectedness of these investments reflects the interconnectedness of the OpenAI and Nvidia stories in particular: Huang may have delivered OpenAI their first AI computer, but it was OpenAI that delivered Nvidia the catalyst for becoming the most valuable company in the world, with the November 2022 launch of ChatGPT. Ever since, the assumption of many in tech has been that the consumer market in particular has been OpenAI’s to lose, or perhaps more accurately, monetize; no company has ever grown faster in terms of users and revenue, and that’s before they had an advertising model! And beyond the numbers, have you used ChatGPT? It’s so useful. You can look up information, or format text, and best of all you can code! Of course there are other models like Anthropic’s Claude, which has excelled at coding in particular, but surely the sheer usefulness makes ultimate success inevitable! If a lot of those takes sound familiar, it’s because I’ve made some version of most of them; I also, perhaps relatedly, took to Twitter like a fish to water. Just imagine, an app that was the nearly perfect mixture of content I was interested in and people I wanted to hear from, and interact with. Best of all it was text: the efficiency of information acquisition was unmatched, and it was just as easy to say my piece. It took me much longer to warm up to Facebook, and, frankly, I never was much of a user; I’ve never been one to image dump episodes of my life, nor have I had much inclination to wade through others’. I wasn’t interested in party photos; I lusted after ideas and arguments, and Twitter — a view shared by much of both tech and media — was much more up my alley. Despite that personal predilection, however, and perhaps because of my background in small town Wisconsin and subsequently living abroad, I retained a strong sense of the importance of Facebook. Sure, the people who I was most interested in hearing from and interacting with may have been the types to leave their friends and family for the big city, but for most people, friends and family were the entire point of life generally, and by extension, social media specifically. To that end, I was convinced from the beginning that Facebook was going to be a huge deal, and argued so multiple times on Stratechery; social media was ultimately a matter of network effects and scale, and Facebook was clearly on the path to domination, even as much of the Twitterati were convinced the company was the next MySpace. I was similarly bullish about Instagram: no, I wasn’t one to post a lot of personal pictures, but while I personally loved text, most people liked photos. What people really liked most of all, however — and not even Facebook saw this coming — was video. TikTok grew into a behemoth with the insight that social media was only ever a stepping stone to personal entertainment, of which video was the pinnacle. There were no network effects of the sort that everyone — including regulators — assumed would lead to eternal Facebook dominance; rather, TikTok realized that Paul Krugman’s infamous dismissal of the Internet actually was somewhat right: most people actually don’t have anything to say that is particularly compelling, which means that limiting the content you see to your social network dramatically decreases the possibility you’ll be entertained every time you open your social networking app. TikTok dispensed with this artificial limitation, simply showing you compelling videos period, no matter where they came from. Of course TikTok wasn’t the first company to figure this out: YouTube was the first video platform, and from the beginning focused on building an algorithm that focused more on giving you videos you were interested in than in showing you what you claimed to want to see. YouTube, however, was and probably always has been my biggest blind spot: I’m just not a big video watcher in general, and YouTube seemed like more work than short-form video, which married the most compelling medium with the most addictive delivery method — the feed. Sure, YouTube was a great acquisition for Google — certainly in line with the charge to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful” — but I — and Google’s moneymaker, Search — was much more interested in text, and pictures if I must. The truth, however, is that YouTube has long been the giant hiding in plain sight: the service is the number one streaming service in the living room — bigger than Netflix — and that’s the company’s 3rd screen after mobile and the PC, where it has no peer. More than that, YouTube is not just the center of culture, but the nurturer of it: the company just announced that it has paid out more than $100 billion to creators over the last four years; given that many creators earn more from brand deals than they do from YouTube ads, that actually understates the size of the YouTube economy. Yes, TikTok is a big deal, but TikTok stars hope to make it on YouTube, where they can actually make a living. And yet, YouTube sometimes seems like an afterthought, at least to people like me and others immersed in the text-based Internet. Last week I was in New York for YouTube’s annual “Made on YouTube” event, but the night before I couldn’t remember the name; I turned to Google, natch, and couldn’t figure it out. The reason is that talk about YouTube mostly happens on YouTube; I, and Google itself, still live in a text-based world. That is the world that was rocked by ChatGPT, especially Google. The company’s February 2023 introduction of Bard in Paris remains one of the most surreal keynotes I’ve ever watched: most of the content was rehashed, the presenters talked as if they were seeing their slides for the first time, and one of the demos of a phone-based feature neglected to remember to have a phone on hand. This was a company facing a frontal assault on their most obvious and profitable area of dominance — text-based information retrieval — and they were completely flat-footed. Google has, in the intervening years, made tremendous strides to come back, including dumping the Bard name in favor of Gemini, itself based on vastly improved underlying models. I’m also impressed by how the company has incorporated AI into search; not only are AI Overviews generally useful, they’re also incredibly fast, and as a bonus have the links I sometimes prefer already at hand. Ironically, however, you could make the case that the biggest impact LLMs have had on Search is giving a federal judge an excuse to let Google continue paying its biggest would-be competitors (like Apple) to simply offer their customers Google instead. The biggest reason to be skeptical of the company’s fortunes in AI is that they had the most to lose; the company is doing an excellent job of minimizing the losses. What I would submit, however, is that Google’s most important and most compelling AI announcements actually don’t have anything to do with Search, at least not yet. These announcements start, as you might expect, with Google’s Deep Mind Research Lab; where they hit the real world, however, is on YouTube — and that, like the user-generated streaming service, is a really big deal. A perfect example of the DeepMind-to-YouTube pipeline was last week’s announcement of Veo 3-based features for making YouTube Shorts. From the company’s blog post: We’ve partnered with Google DeepMind to bring a custom version of their most powerful video generation model, Veo 3, to YouTube. Veo 3 Fast is designed to work seamlessly in YouTube Shorts for millions of creators and users, for free. It generates outputs with lower latency at 480p so you can easily create video clips – and for the first time, with sound – from any idea, all from your phone. This initial launch will allow you to not only generate videos, but also use one video to animate another (or a photo), stylize your video with a single touch, and add objects. You can also create an entire video — complete with voiceover — from a collection of clips, or convert speech to song. All of these features are a bit silly, but, well, that’s often where genius — or at least virality — comes from. Critics, of course, will label this an AI slop machine, and they’ll be right! The vast majority of content created by these tools will be boring and unwatched. That, however, is already the case with YouTube: the service sees 500 hours of content uploaded every minute, and most of that content isn’t interesting to anyone; the magic of YouTube, however, is the algorithm that finds out what is actually compelling and spreads it to an audience that wants exactly that. To put it another way, for YouTube AI slop is a strategy credit: given that the service has already mastered organizing overwhelming amounts of content and only surfacing what is good, it, more than anyone else, can handle exponentially more content which, through the sheer force of numbers, will result in an absolute increase of content that is actually compelling. That’s not the only strategy credit YouTube has; while the cost of producing AI-generated video will likely be lower than the cost of producing human-generated video, at least in the long run, the latter’s costs are not borne by TikTok or Meta (Facebook and Instagram are basically video platforms at this point). Rather, the brilliance of the user-generated content model is that creators post their content for free! This, however, means that AI-generated video is actually more expensive, at least if it’s made on TikTok or Meta’s servers. YouTube, however, pays its creators, which means that for the service AI-generated video actually has the potential to lower costs in the long run, increasing the incentive to leverage DeepMind’s industry-leading models. In short, while everyone immediately saw how AI could be disruptive to Search, AI is very much a sustaining innovation for YouTube: it increases the amount of compelling content in absolute terms, and it does so with better margins, at least in the long run. Here’s the million billion trillion dollar question: what is going to matter more in the long run, text or video? Sure, Google would like to dominate everything, but if it had to choose, is it better to dominate video or dominate text? The history of social networking that I documented above suggests that video is, in the long run, much more compelling to many more people. To put it another way, the things that people in tech and media are interested in has not historically been aligned with what actually makes for the largest service or makes the most money: people like me, or those reading me, care about text and ideas; the services that matter specialize in videos and entertainment, and to the extent that AI matters for the latter YouTube is primed to be the biggest winner, even as the same people who couldn’t understand why Twitter didn’t measure up to Facebook go ga-ga over text generation and coding capabilities. The potential impact of AI on YouTube’s fortunes isn’t just about AI-created videos; rather, the most important announcement of last week’s event was the first indicator that AI can massively increase the monetization potential of every video on the streaming service. You might have missed the announcement, because YouTube underplayed it; from their event blog post: We’re adding updates to brand deals and Shopping to make brand collaborations easier than ever. We’re accelerating these deals through a new initiative and new product features to make sure those partnerships succeed – like the ability to add a link to a brand’s site in Shorts. And YouTube Shopping is expanding to more markets and merchants and getting help from AI to make tagging easier. It’s just half a sentence — “getting help from AI to make tagging easier” — but the implications of those eight words are profound; here’s how YouTube explained the feature: We know tagging products can be time-consuming, so to make the experience better for creators, we’re leaning on an AI-powered system to identify the optimal moment a product is mentioned and automatically display the product tag at that time, capturing viewer interest when it’s highest. We’ll also begin testing the ability to automatically identify and tag all eligible products mentioned in your video later this year. The creator who demonstrated the feature — that right there is a great example of how YouTube is a different world than the one I and other people in the media inhabit — was very enthusiastic about the reduction in hassle and time-savings that would come from using AI to do a menial task like tagging sponsored products; that sounds like AI at its best, freeing up creative people to do what they do best. There’s no reason, however, why auto-tagging can’t become something much greater; in fact, I already explained the implications of this exact technology in explaining why AI made me bullish on Meta: This leads to a third medium-term AI-derived benefit that Meta will enjoy: at some point ads will be indistinguishable from content. You can already see the outlines of that given I’ve discussed both generative ads and generative content; they’re the same thing! That image that is personalized to you just might happen to include a sweater or a belt that Meta knows you probably want; simply click-to-buy. It’s not just generative content, though: AI can figure out what is in other content, including authentic photos and videos. Suddenly every item in that influencer photo can be labeled and linked — provided the supplier bought into the black box, of course — making not just every piece of generative AI a potential ad, but every piece of content period. The market implications of this are profound. One of the oddities of analyzing digital ad platforms is that some of the most important indicators are counterintuitive; I wrote this spring: The most optimistic time for Meta’s advertising business is, counter-intuitively, when the price-per-ad is dropping, because that means that impressions are increasing. This means that Meta is creating new long-term revenue opportunities, even as its ads become cost competitive with more of its competitors; it’s also notable that this is the point when previous investor freak-outs have happened. When I wrote that I was, as I noted in the introduction, feeling more cautious about Meta’s business, given that Reels is built out and the inventory opportunities of Meta AI were not immediately obvious. I realize now, though, that I was distracted by Meta AI: the real impact of AI is to make everything inventory, which is to say that the price-per-ad on Meta will approach $0 for basically forever. Would-be competitors are finding it difficult enough to compete with Meta’s userbase and resources in a probabilisitic world; to do so with basically zero price umbrella seems all-but-impossible. This analysis was spot-on; I just pointed it at the wrong company. This opportunity to leverage AI to make basically every pixel monetizable absolutely exists for Meta; Meta, however, has to actually develop the models and infrastructure to do it at scale. Google is already there; it was the company universally decried for being slow-moving that announced the first version of this feature last week. I can’t overstate what a massive opportunity this is: every item in every YouTube video is well on its way to being a monetizable surface. Yes, that may sound dystopian when I put it so baldly, but if you think about it you can see the benefits; I’ve been watching a lot of home improvement videos lately, and it sure would be useful to be able to not just identify but helpfully have a link to buy a lot of the equipment I see, much of which is basically in the background because it’s not the point of the video. It won’t be long until YouTube has that inventory, which it could surface with an affiliate fee link, or make biddable for companies who want to reach primed customers. More generally, you can actually envision Google pulling this off: the company may have gotten off to a horrible start in the chatbot era, but the company has pulled itself together and is increasingly bringing its model and infrastructure leadership to bear, even as Meta has had to completely overhaul their AI approach after hitting a wall. I’m sure CEO Mark Zuckerberg will figure it out, but Google — surprise! — is the company actually shipping. Or, rather, YouTube is. Close readers of Stratechery have been observing — and probably, deservedly, smirking — at this most unexpected evolution: I am enjoying @benthompson’s journey to becoming a $GOOGL bull pic.twitter.com/xryDBIukRW That quote is from Paradigm Shifts and the Winner’s Curse, an Article that was mostly about my concerns about Apple and Amazon, and reads: And, by the same token, I’m much more appreciative of Google’s amorphous nature and seeming lack of strategy. That makes them hard to analyze — again, I’ve been honest for years about the challenges I find in understanding Mountain View — but the company successfully navigated one paradigm shift, and is doing much better than I originally expected with this one. Larry Page and Sergey Brin famously weren’t particularly interested in business or in running a company; they just wanted to do cool things with computers in a college-like environment like they had at Stanford. That the company, nearly thirty years later, is still doing cool things with computers in a college-like environment may be maddening to analysts like me who want clarity and efficiency; it also may be the key to not just surviving but winning across multiple paradigms. Appreciating the benefits of Google being an amorphous blob where no one knows what is going on, least of all leadership, is a big part of my evolution; this Article is the second part: that blob ultimately needs a way to manifest the technology it manages to come up with, and if you were to distill my worries about Google in the age of AI it would be to wonder how the company could become an answer machine — which Page and Brin always wanted — when it risked losing the massive economic benefits that came from empowering users to choose the winners of auctions Google conducted for advertisers. That, however, is ultimately the text-based world, and there’s a case to be made that, in the long run, it simply won’t matter as much as the world of video.

Title: Uber Stock To $200?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) has experienced significant growth recently thanks to its primary ridesharing, delivery, and freight sectors capitalizing on recovering demand, as well as a renewed focus on improving margins and returning value to shareholders. With gross bookings rising 17-18% year over year in the recent quarters, and a strong increase in adjusted EBITDA, investors are questioning whether Uber could significantly outperform at its current valuation. Is it possible for the stock to double, or at the very least, provide substantial upside? Let’s delve into the thesis. However, for those seeking upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has produced returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Additionally, refer to – Is Klarna stock worth the premium? At its present valuation, Uber seems to be trading with relatively moderate expectations factored in. Its revenue base is already substantial—approximately $43.9 billion in 2024, reflecting an 18% increase year over year, and if it can maintain 18% annual growth, revenues could approach $70 billion by 2027; with margins improving to 12–15%, net income could rise to $6–10 billion compared to the current $3 billion. At the moment, Uber is valued near a $200 billion market cap, but if it were to achieve higher profitability and a more favorable 25–40× P/E ratio in line with its competitors, the company could be justified at a $350–400 billion valuation within three years. This calculation translates to a share price of around $200, or nearly double today’s $99, provided that Uber meets its growth and margin expansion goals. Several factors could assist Uber in realizing that upside: Uber currently appears to be a more mature, cash-flow positive growth business, rather than a constantly loss-making startup. At $99 per share (EV/Revenue 4.3-4.8x, P/E in the 15-20× range depending on predictions), the market has already started incorporating many positive expectations. Nonetheless, there remains ample opportunity for upside if Uber can succeed in expanding its margins, maintaining consistent revenue growth, and providing returns to shareholders. Under a realistic scenario of solid medium-term growth alongside improved profitability, the stock could potentially double from current levels—particularly if multiples shift upwards. For investors who believe that Uber can preserve its scale advantages, manage costs effectively, and execute its diversified strategy, it presents a compelling asymmetric opportunity. However, the execution will be crucial—and there is considerable downside risk if growth slows or margins fail to meet expectations. Investors must brace for significant volatility and the possibility of considerable losses if market conditions worsen or if the company does not accomplish its ambitious growth objectives. While the potential for a 2x upside is mathematically viable based on projected revenues, it necessitates flawless execution in a rapidly shifting and competitive environment. Now, we implement a risk assessment methodology while developing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, comprising a collection of 30 stocks, has a proven track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the prior 4-year period. What’s the reason for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks yielded better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: ASML Stock: An Overlooked AI Play?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/23/asml-stock-an-overlooked-ai-play/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), the Dutch semiconductor equipment powerhouse recognized as one of the most crucial firms in the semiconductor ecosystem, has witnessed its stock rise almost 25% in the last month, bouncing back from a decline in July following its Q2 earnings report, which sparked worries about demand for 2026. ASML’s significance lies in its distinctive function: it manufactures the machines that enable the production of the world's most advanced chips, making it essential to the entire semiconductor value chain. With the stock gaining momentum, is now the right time to invest? To provide context, here’s what ASML specializes in. ASML produces the most advanced manufacturing tools in the semiconductor sector, and arguably, the entire world. Its standout product is its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. These devices utilize ultra-short light wavelengths to engrave fine circuit patterns on silicon wafers, facilitating the manufacture of the leading-edge chips of 5 nanometers and below. Put simply, without ASML, the processors that power AI data centers, smartphones, and even contemporary vehicles would not be possible. Thus, ASML stands out as a unique enterprise. EUV technology plays a vital role in prolonging Moore’s Law, a long-held industry trend whereby transistor density doubles roughly every two years, enabling chipmakers to keep pushing the boundaries of computing capabilities and cost efficiency. See AVGO Stock vs. NVDA & INTC Multiple factors have shifted sentiment to be more favorable for ASML recently. To start, U.S. tariffs on semiconductor equipment, which include ASML’s lithography machines, were avoided thanks to a U.S.-EU trade agreement that exempts semiconductor production equipment from tariffs. This alleviated a significant worry for ASML's stock. Regarding demand, investment in AI remains robust. Major players like Nvidia and Broadcom are experiencing substantial growth as the increase in training and executing intricate models drives demand for high-performance semiconductors—the very kind ASML’s machines enable to manufacture. Indeed, the company reports that many of its largest customers are already increasing their EUV capacity to match the escalating need for AI chips. To illustrate the scale of these investments, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) indicated a potential cumulative capital expenditure of $364 billion for their respective current fiscal years. Much of this could translate into heightened demand for ASML. Importantly, ASML’s largest client, TSMC, reported a 37% year-over-year increase in revenue through August 2025. This impressive revenue growth is attributed to advanced nodes such as 3nm and 5nm, with the scaling up of 2nm chips expected to further stimulate demand for ASML’s EUV machinery. ASML stock is currently trading at 36x projected FY2025 earnings, which is slightly high, but there are positive signs for the stock. According to consensus estimates, ASML’s revenues are set to increase by a robust 14% this year. During the past quarter, ASML recorded net bookings of 5.5 billion euros ($6.4 billion), approximately 25% above expectations, and a historic backlog of 33 billion euros ($38 billion). With lead times of 12 to 18 months for most of its offerings, current orders should accurately reflect customer confidence well into 2026, suggesting favorable prospects for future revenue growth. Additionally, the company’s dominant market position, cutting-edge and proprietary technology, and its connection to the generative AI trend could also render the stock appealing. Discover more about the Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), generating impressive returns for investors. Separately, if you seek potential upside with less volatility than individual stocks like ASML, you might consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and achieved over 91% returns since its inception. As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; they’ve exhibited a smoother trajectory, as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: BlackRock and major firms report $76M outflows in Ethereum ETFs

Share this article Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $76 million in outflows on Monday, with major asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity among the firms reporting investor redemptions from their exchange-traded funds. The outflows continue a pattern of volatility seen in September 2025, with ETH-tracking funds experiencing fluctuating investor interest. Fidelity and Bitwise drove much of the redemption activity, while BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF saw occasional inflows that partially offset the broader trend across the product category. Since launching in July 2024, spot Ethereum ETFs have accumulated over $13 billion in net inflows overall. However, Grayscale’s legacy trust has seen outflows exceeding $4.5 billion as investors migrated to newer, lower-fee alternatives. The funds have shown institutional appetite for ETH exposure in recent months, with several trading days recording more than $100 million in inflows. Ethereum traded at approximately current levels amid broader digital asset market movements. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Anthony Scaramucci Calls Avalanche The 'Swiss Army Knife' Of Layer-1 Blockchains, Made A 'Big Bet' On Ethereum Killer Because Of This Reason

Anthony Scaramucci, strategic advisor of AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. AGRI, sounded optimistic on Avalanche AVAX/USD on Monday, deeming it as the “Swiss army knife” among Layer-1 networks. AGRI stock is racing ahead of the pack. See if it is worth your attention here. Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, who will serve as the company’s strategic advisor, said that they made a “big bet” on Avalanche due to its tokenization potential. “Lots of big corporate CTOs are picking up Avalanche as part of their story to tokenize their funds or potentially even tokenize their assets,” he said. Scaramucci also highlighted the importance of subnets, interoperable networks within Avalanche’s ecosystem that can be tailored to specific use cases. “I often say that Avalanche is like a Swiss army knife of Layer-1 networks, so it’s got a lot of flexibility,” he added. See Also: Crypto Isn’t The Real Threat – It’s Regulatory Chaos The rebranding and capital raise strategy comes in the wake of growing interest in the Avalanche network. Scaramucci endorsed the Layer-1 network last month, stating that its "moment is coming.” He said last year that AVAX, often dubbed an Ethereum ETH/USD-killer, is part of his cryptocurrency portfolio and among the "high-quality, great core assets” in the long term. Avalanche, which launched in 2020, seeks to provide scalable and secure infrastructure for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Notably, BlackRock’s tokenized fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, expanded its use to the Avalanche blockchain. Price Action: At the time of writing, AVAX was trading up 4.78% to $33.29, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The coin has surged 27% over the last month. AgriFORCE shares slipped 7.08% in after-hours trading after closing 134.44% higher at $5.650 during Monday’s regular trading session. The stock lagged on the Momentum and Growth parameters as of this writing. Visit Benzinga Edge Stock Rankings to compare it with leading cryptocurrency treasury firms, such as Strategy Inc.

Title: Market Analyst Alleges XRP Price Is Being Deliberately Suppressed, Who Are The Culprits?

A new debate is emerging in the crypto world after a video shared by Versan Aljarrah, the founder of Black Swan Capitalist, highlighted bold claims from about the XRP price financial expert Dr. Jim Willie. In the video, Willie claims that the current XRP price is not natural and powerful players are artificially holding it down. According to Willie, the goal of this move is to acquire more XRP at low prices due to its expected role in the future of global finance. Dr. Jim Willie explains that large banks and financial institutions are not letting the XRP price rise in value at this stage. He says this is not by accident but by design. In his words, what appears to be a flat market is, in reality, a stall created by influential players. According to Willie, these institutions believe XRP will be a key part of the financial system in the future. That is why they are working to build their holdings while the asset remains cheap. Instead of letting the market decide its fair price, they are making sure the cost stays low long enough for them to collect more. Willie goes further by naming some of the groups he believes are involved. He points to BlackRock as one of the major players working to keep XRP under pressure. He even calls BlackRock “a disgustingly corrupt private equity firm” instead of a bank, making clear how negative his view of them is. Willie also says big players may ask Ripple to go along with this plan. He claims the big players are asking Ripple to help keep XRP under $3 so they can buy massive amounts. According to him, they do not want to buy XRP at $7 or $8, which is where he believes the market already values the asset. Instead, they want Ripple’s help to hold it down, giving them time to buy what he calls “a boatload” of tokens at bargain prices. These statements, shared by Aljarrah, suggest that the current market price of XRP may not be a natural one. If Willie’s claims are valid, then what people see is not simply a matter of supply and demand but a coordinated effort by strong financial groups to control the XRP price and reap the most significant benefits. Many traders and investors have long worried that digital assets do not move freely, but rather, powerful hands behind the scenes actively shape them. Within the digital asset ecosystem, where trust and transparency are already constant issues, such claims strike at the heart of ongoing debates about whether ordinary investors are getting a fair market or one designed to benefit only the most prominent institutions.

The chipmaker said Monday it had signed a letter of intent with OpenAI to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia-powered AI systems. A gigawatt is equal to one billion watts of power—enough electricity to supply millions of homes. We're proud to announce a landmark partnership with @OpenAI to build new gigascale AI factories using millions of NVIDIA GPUs. 🤝 This partnership will supply 10 gigawatts of GPUs to fuel @OpenAI's data center growth. pic.twitter.com/CYEB2PdfWY — NVIDIA (@nvidia) September 22, 2025 According to a report by Bloomberg, the money will be provided in stages, with the first $10 billion coming when the deal is signed, citing people familiar with the matter. Nvidia will receive OpenAI equity as part of the deal. Nvidia’s stock (NVDA) rose 4% from $177.50 to $184.16 on news of the partnership. In an interview with CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the deal the next leap forward for artificial intelligence. “The computing demand is going through the roof,” Jensen said. “This partnership is about building an AI infrastructure that enables AI to go from the labs into the world. This is about the AI industrial revolution arriving.” The plan calls for vast new data centers filled with millions of GPUs, including its upcoming Vera Rubin platform, designed for training and running next-generation models. The first gigawatt of capacity is expected to go online in the second half of 2026, with the rest rolling out as Nvidia ramps its investment. Joining Huang were OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and OpenAI President Greg Brockman. Altman said the deal with Nvidia will expand the ambitions set by the Stargate project announced by President Donald Trump in January. “This is the fuel we need to drive improvement—to build better models, generate revenue, everything,” Altman said. “This is helping us, along with our partners at Stargate, Microsoft, and Oracle, to build increasing amounts of infrastructure to deliver on what the world is demanding.” Deploying 10 gigawatts of computing capacity won’t be simple, however. Cooling alone can consume nearly 40% of a data center’s power use, according to energy consultancy 174 Power Global. Environmental concerns are also mounting. Deloitte estimates data centers will account for about 2% of global electricity use in 2025, or 536 terawatt-hours, but says demand from power-hungry AI could push that figure to more than 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2030. The United Nations Environment Programme has warned of rising water consumption for cooling, while the Environmental and Energy Study Institute said data centers are already straining electric grids.

Title: 3 Mistakes Smart People Make Investing In AI Stocks
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamsarhan/2025/09/22/3-mistakes-smart-people-make-investing-in-ai-stocks/
Time Published: 2025-09-22T22:14:07Z
Full Content:
ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the strongest trends on Wall Street in 2025. I began trading in the 1990’s and the AI trend reminds me of the early stages of the dot-com boom during the late 1990s (in excitement, hype, and lofty expectations). When we look back in history the creation of the internet will likely go down with the same impact as fire, the wheel, or the printing press. Now, investors are wondering will AI have the same impact? The short answer is, only time will tell. In the rush to find the next big monster stock, many investors are repeating old patterns that have historically ended with disappointment. The AI revolution is real, but investing successfully in it requires discipline, patience, proper risk management, and rational analysis. Remember, most dot com stocks are not around today. The same is true for other major technological disruptions like the airlines, railroads, and countless other examples. Here are three common mistakes I see smart people making when they invest in AI stocks. Mistake 1: Chasing Hype Without FundamentalsThe allure of the next big winner is extremely powerful and that causes many smart people to make emotional, not rational, decisions with their money. One common emotional mistake I see people make time and time again is thinking this time might be different and they jump in, after a big move up, and chase a big winning stock. The solution here is to have a plan, respect risk, and remember, this time is not different. After you buy a stock, it can only do one of three things, go up, down, or sideways. It doesn’t matter if it is an AI stock, gold stock, or railroad. All stocks go up, down, or sideways. Even great companies that are around today that survived the dot com boom and bust, had huge swings in their prices and those swings would knock out most investors. It’s easy to get caught up in the hype and excitement. It happens to most people but respecting risk, focusing on fundamentals, and making rational decisions are keys to long-term success in the market. It is also important to note that AI is full of visionaries, bold promises, and captivating stories. It’s easy to be pulled in by exciting headlines about startups developing new AI models, or tech giants unveiling massive investments in training computers to think “like humans.” Just like in the dot-com boom, the stories feel groundbreaking. The problem? Many companies riding the AI hype lose money. Some are even startups with barely any revenue. The same was true during the dot com boom and subsquent bust. Typically, what happens is investors pile in hoping to capture outsized returns, but they often end up buying into businesses that can’t support their lofty valuations and ultimately lose money when the stock falls. The history lesson: dot-com déjà vuIn 1999, companies with “.com” in their names raised billions, even when they had no plan to generate lasting cash flow. When the bubble burst, most collapsed. A similar pattern can’t be ruled out for AI. While some winners will emerge and dominate, many current players may fade into irrelevance or bankruptcy. What fundamentals still matter in AIA lesson often forgotten during speculative booms is that traditional financial metrics matter. Cash flow, balance sheet strength, and proven demand should anchor investment decisions. For chipmakers like NVIDIA that already generate substantial profits, the AI boom supports a strong existing foundation. But for early-stage firms, the risks can outweigh the potential if investors ignore fundamentals. Investor takeaway: Always separate visionary storytelling from hard financial data. A revolutionary technology is not a guarantee of revolutionary profits. Mistake 2: Overconcentration in One or Two Big NamesThe temptation to “go all in” is real and is another common mistake I see very smart people make in various market cycles. NVIDIA’s meteoric rise has transformed it into one of the best-performing stocks of the decade, largely due to AI. Its chips are essential for training AI models, and its revenue has exploded as demand for data center hardware soars. For many investors, the temptation is to put a disproportionate share of their portfolio into one strong idea. The temptation is there for just about any stock, it especially when the stock is going up. The same happened in past cycles. During the dot com boom, names like Intel, Cisco, Qualcomm, and Microsoft raced higher. During the smartphone revolution, it was Apple. Those who bet heavily on a single titan enjoyed enormous returns—but timing and risk management matter. Investors who bought those names at their peak lost a lot of money during the dot com crash. Investor takeaway: AI is bigger than one or two companies. Proper risk management and proper diversification across the value chain can help reduce risk while maintaining upside potential as long as AI stocks remain in favor. Mistake 3: Ignoring Cycles and ValuationsThe myth of endless growth and this time is different are very powerful.Boom cycles make it feel like the good times will never end. In 2023 and 2024, AI fueled explosive stock runs, with market leaders adding billions to their market caps in months. The narrative was simple: AI will reshape everything, and therefore valuations don’t matter. That mindset is very dangerous. No matter how transformative a technology, growth slows and expectations reset. Even industry titans experience profit cycles, regulatory pressures, and increased competition. Assuming AI leaders will post quarter after quarter of uninterrupted growth ignores how markets function. Why valuation discipline matters in AIWhen investors pay 100-400+ times earnings, they are essentially betting that hypergrowth will continue for years without fail. That leaves no margin of safety. If growth merely slows rather than collapses, stocks priced for perfection can still fall by double digits. Tesla, for example, soared on future-oriented narratives about electrification. Yet periods of slower sales or increased competition triggered sharp corrections in the stock, even though the long-term thesis hasn’t disappeared. AI stocks face the same risk: growing markets, but volatile share prices. Liquidity, rates, and market sentimentAnother overlooked factor is the broader economic cycle. AI companies thrive in markets with plentiful liquidity, like when interest rates are low and growth capital is abundant. Markets and the economy move in cycles. Investors who ignore this reality may get caught in market downturns that can be far more brutal than expected. Investor takeaway: Even the best AI stocks can tumble if valuations get too stretched. A disciplined entry point, and strong respect for risk, matters as much as believing in the long-term story. Putting It All Together: An Investor PlaybookAI is unlike any other technological wave because of its scope, touching everything from healthcare and finance to defense and entertainment. Yet human behavior in markets has not changed, and the same investor mistakes recur. To avoid missteps, investors can build a playbook: Prioritize fundamentals: Separate hype from balance sheet strength. Profitable companies with durable moats offer safer long-term prospects. Diversify exposure: History has taught me that it is usually a good idea not to put all your money in one “hot” stock. Respect cycles: Recognize AI leaders can endure corrections when valuations run too hot—patience, timing, and risk managemnet always matter. Stay adaptive: The winners today may not be winners tomorrow. New stocks come all the time and shifts in regulation can disrupt even dominant players. Measure conviction against risk: Ask whether your excitement is based on headlines—or on sustainable advantages. Conclusion: Riding the AI Wave WiselyInvestors are right to be excited about AI. It will likely be as transformative as the internet, smartphones, or electrification. But the stock market has a way of turning great technologies into poor investments when enthusiasm divorces from discipline. The good news: by avoiding these three mistakes—chasing hype without fundamentals, overconcentrating in one name, and ignoring valuation cycles—investors can improve their odds of capturing long-term gains without succumbing to short-term pain. There is a very strong chance that over time, AI will create trillion-dollar companies. It will also produce plenty of losers. The key is remembering that markets ultimately reward patient, rational investors who separate stories from substance.

Seoul, South Korea, September 22nd, 2025, Chainwire Seoul Exchange, One of Only Two Licensed Platforms For Unlisted Securities, Will Exclusively Use Story To Settle Tokenized RWAs Partnership set to bring programmable assets to Korea’s $450b crypto market, the world’s second largest by trading volume Seoul Exchange and Story Protocol have entered into an agreement to build Korea’s first dedicated blockchain exchange for tokenized cultural and intellectual property assets. The collaboration outlines how Seoul Exchange will launch a regulated RWA trading platform powered entirely by Story’s blockchain infrastructure for the next 3 years. Seoul Exchange is a fintech company that provides brokerage services for unlisted stocks of startups and venture companies through its unlisted securities trading platform “Seoul Exchange.” It is one of only two platforms officially selected by the Korean government to operate under the financial regulatory sandbox. Seoul Exchange has received investment from leading Korean and global VCs such as Hashed, SoftBank Ventures, Capstone Partners, and POSCO Technology Investment. Under the agreement, Seoul Exchange will use Story as the sole infrastructure provider for registering and settling tokenized offerings. For an initial term 3 years, all listings on the exchange ranging from music IP and webtoons to patents and private securities, will be recorded on Story’s network, leveraging its composable architecture and native $IP token economy. IP is expected to become Korea’s leading real-world asset (RWA) category, with Story positioned as the exclusive chain for Seoul Exchange’s IP tokenization. Story is a Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built to make intellectual property programmable. Backed by $136 million from a16z, Polychain, and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in early 2025 and has quickly become a leading infrastructure for tokenized IP. Korea is home to some of the world’s most successful creative exports, but monetizing IP remains limited to insiders. This new trading platform aims to change that. By bringing IP onchain, Story and Seoul Exchange are unlocking a new class of fractional, transparent, and globally accessible digital securities. Global IP is valued at over $80 trillion, yet most of it remains illiquid and inaccessible. This partnership aims to unlock IP and other real-world assets (RWAs) via blockchain, allowing global investors to own, trade, and earn from high-value creative works. Korean storytellers have captured the world’s imagination. Global hits like K-POP Demon Hunter became Netflix’s most-popular film of all time with 236 million views in the first nine weeks. Parasite won Best Picture at the Oscars. Squid Game became Netflix’s most-watched show. Baby Shark is a global phenomenon. But behind this success lies a structural problem: creators rarely retain ownership or share in the long-term upside. Platforms like Netflix own the IP. Studios operate on thin margins. Even as Korean content goes global, the value flows elsewhere.This imbalance has sparked growing debate in Korea, with many voices calling for a new model that allows creators to break free from reliance on upfront financing and pre-production deals. Story is introducing such an alternative through content tokenization. By enabling global fans to directly participate in fundraising, production companies can retain ownership of their IP and instead engage in distribution agreements that ensure fairer and more sustainable revenue models. This approach not only protects creators’ rights but also opens the door to a new, fan-driven economy in entertainment. The platform will combine retail accessibility with institutional-grade compliance under Korean regulations. Should a Korean won-pegged stablecoin be approved by regulators, the platform is designed to support its integration it may be integrated for native currency settlement, further aligning with domestic financial infrastructure. Tokenized content, including music rights, game universes, can be listed and traded by retail and institutional investors alike, all within Korea’s evolving STO regulatory sandbox. Story Protocol is the world’s first Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for IP. It enables IP to be registered, licensed, and monetized in real time, embedding royalties and usage terms directly into the tokenized representation of creative assets. Backed by investors including a16z, Polychain, Hashed and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in early 2025 and has already rapidly expanded its ecosystem and onboarded a diverse music collectives, DeFi protocols, and global entertainment IPs. For example, Story has already begun tokenizing major K-culture IP, including the music rights of leading K-pop artists (BTS, BLACKPINK, Psy, BIGBANG) and global artists (Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus) Seoul Exchange’s integration makes Story the de facto infrastructure for Korea’s next wave of tokenized RWAs, positioning it as the blockchain gateway for cultural capital. This partnership bridges Korea’s booming cultural industries with the world’s capital markets. The platform will prioritize assets with strong fan engagement and long-term value potential, and will also support future integrations with financial products, remix licenses, and governance layers, bringing programmability to previously static IP rights. JD Yang, CEO, Seoul Exchange: “Through this collaboration, Seoul Exchange has further strengthened the stability and trust in the process of building our STO exchange. We aim to become Korea’s leading STO exchange through a differentiated tokenization model centered on IP and content.” Seung-yoon “SY” Lee, Co-founder & CEO, Story Protocol: “We see this as a landmark step in making Korea’s world-class cultural IP accessible to global investors. Story enables creators and platforms like Seoul Exchange to go beyond traditional licensing models to build liquidity, loyalty, and monetization around programmable IP. Intellectual property is the largest untapped asset class in the world, worth over $80 trillion, and with Korea now the second-largest crypto trading market in the world, the opportunity to pioneer new asset classes is massive. This partnership brings us one step closer to unlocking that value at global scale. With this move, Story will be one of only two chains powering RWAs in Korea, the second-largest crypto market in the world, confirming IP’s place at the center of Korea’s next blockchain growth cycle.” About Story Story is a Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built to make intellectual property programmable. Backed by $136 million from a16z, Polychain, and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in early 2025 and has quickly become a leading infrastructure for tokenized IP. The network enables creators, developers, enterprises, and AI labs to register content as on-chain assets with embedded rights, turning media, data, and AI-generated works into legally enforceable digital property. By bridging the gap between outdated legal frameworks and the realities of the AI era, Story makes it possible to track provenance, automate licensing, and unlock new markets for ideas. As the foundation for IP’s evolution into an internet-native asset class, Story powers a more open, equitable, and composable creative economy. Copyright © 2025. All Rights Reserved By Media Fuse LTD

Title: Gold Is Pricier Than Ever. Here's Why Experts See It Rising Even Higher

Gold prices climbed to a record high Monday, extending a blistering rally that experts don't expect to end anytime soon. Gold futures surged 2% Monday to trade at an all-time high of about $3,780 an ounce. The real gold price, which adjusts for inflation, hit a record high earlier this month for the first time since 1980. In a note on Monday, Deutsche Bank analysts forecast that gold prices could rise above $4,000 by the end of 2025, implying a full-year return of more than 50%. That kind of price appreciation would make gold the year’s best-performing asset and likely put it in the top decile of S&P 500 stocks, on par with Nvidia (NVDA). Investors often acquire gold as a hedge against inflation, political turmoil and economic uncertainty, and some investing experts recommend increasing exposure to the precious metal given current market conditions. Bullion, as well as exchange-traded funds tied to gold or to shares of miners, could provide entry points. The reasons behind gold's stellar year are plentiful and interrelated. Central bank demand, a weaker dollar, President Donald Trump's tariffs, and interest rates all bear some responsibility and are expected to continue to support gold prices in the coming months. Conflict in Europe and the Middle East, as well as simmering tensions between the U.S. and China, have given central banks around the world reason to be major buyers of gold this year. According to the World Gold Council’s 2025 Central Bank Gold Reserves Survey, 95% of central bankers expect global gold reserves to increase this year, and a record 43% forecast their own bank’s reserves would increase over the same period. No respondents said they expected their reserves to decline this year, despite record gold prices. Geopolitical crises are a major reason central banks add to their gold reserves. Gold’s performance during times of crisis was either highly or somewhat relevant to their gold portfolio, said 85% of respondents, and 71% cited its role as a geopolitical risk hedge. Gold buying is also being driven by a desire to diversify reserves. Nearly three-quarters of respondents expect the U.S. dollar’s share of global reserves to decline over the next year as banks add gold and other currencies such as the euro and Chinese renminbi. The value of the U.S. dollar has declined precipitously this year amid a dramatic reset of the domestic and international economic outlooks. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, has declined more than 10% this year. The vast majority of the index’s losses came when trade uncertainty and global tensions were at their highest from early March to early July. Concerns that tariffs and Trump’s immigration crackdown would slow U.S. growth, and potentially push the economy into a recession, weighed on the dollar through those months. The decline may have also partially been driven by de-dollarization or the “Sell America” trade, in which foreign investors, spooked by the Trump administration, dumped dollars and Treasurys. A weaker greenback is expected to continue to be a tailwind for gold, which is priced in dollars, through the rest of the year. “I think almost certainly gold will close above $4,000 before the end of this year,” Jeffrey Gundlach, the founder and CEO of investment manager DoubleLine Capital, told CNBC last week. Gundlach said his ideal portfolio would be 25% gold, an allocation he called “not excessive” in light of dollar trends that he expects to persist. The Federal Reserve is also aiding gold. The central bank cut interest rates last week for the first time this year, and tentatively forecast two more cuts before the end of 2025. A lower federal funds rate should translate into lower Treasury yields, making gold—which doesn’t pay interest—relatively more attractive to investors who have already funneled a record $85 billion into gold funds this year, according to fund flows data from Bank of America. President Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve have also raised questions about the central bank’s independence. If the White House exerts more control over the Fed, which appears likely given Trump will appoint a successor to Fed Chair Jerome Powell next May, it could erode faith in U.S. monetary policy, further bolstering gold by weakening investors’ confidence in the economic outlook, the U.S. dollar, and Treasurys.

Title: Google faces antitrust déjà vu as US seeks to break up its digital advertising business
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/09/22/google-digital-advertising-trial-monopoly-antitrust/
Time Published: 2025-09-22T21:02:00Z
Full Content:
After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department’s attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising. The trial that opened Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court revolves around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google’s digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue. Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a “remedy” trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions. “The purpose of a remedy is doing what is necessary to restore competition,” said Julia Tarver Wood in an opening statement for the DOJ’s antitrust division. Wood said that the Google is manipulating the market in a way that is antithetical to free market competition. “The means to cheat are buried in computer codes and algorithms,” Wood said. An attorney for Google, Karen Dunn, countered that the remedy proposed by the government is reckless and radical, and that the DOJ is attempting to remove Google entirely from the competition. No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can’t be filed until the remedy is determined. The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden’s administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google’s services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive. If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology — a proposal that the company’s lawyers warned would “invite disruption and damage” to consumers and the internet’s ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years. Google believes it has already made enough changes to its “Ad Manager” system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling., The legal battle over Google’s advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct. In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month. Even though Google didn’t agree with all aspects of Mehta’s decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist — a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet’s stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta’s decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion — an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google’s ad technology as a monopoly in April. In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta’s decision during the upcoming trial. As they did in the search case, Google’s lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department’s “radical” proposals. The Justice Department is “fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed,” Google’s lawyers argued leading up to the trial. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Shares of a semiconductor testing company rose Monday after an analyst highlighted strong demand trends and collaboration with a major chip-industry player. Meanwhile, reports of an impending product safety announcement dragged down shares of a consumer health firm. Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher as plans by Nvidia (NVDA) to invest up to $100 million in ChatGPT maker OpenAI reinvigorated optimism around artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 added 0.4%, extending its streak of all-time closing highs to three consecutive sessions. The Dow ticked 0.1% higher, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.7%, with both setting their own fresh closing records. Shares of Nvidia finished 4% higher. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. The day's top performance in the S&P 500 belonged to shares of semiconductor equipment maker Teradyne (TER), which surged 13%. Susquehanna Financial boosted its price target on Teradyne stock, with its analysts saying the provider of automated test equipment for semiconductors and robotic systems could benefit from strong demand trends over the coming years and highlighting Teradyne's increasing partnership with chip industry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). White House officials confirmed that Oracle (ORCL) is part of a consortium set to control the U.S. operations of the social media platform TikTok. Oracle also announced that Clay Magouyrk, current president of cloud infrastructure, and Mike Sicilia, president of industries, will take the reins of the enterprise software giant as co-CEOs. Current CEO Safra Catz will remain with Oracle as the executive vice chair of its board, while co-founder Larry Ellison will maintain his role as chief technology officer and board chair. Oracle shares jumped 6.3%. Moderna (MRNA) shares gained 5.2% after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine panel voted on updated recommendations related to COVID shots.

Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue (KVUE) dropped 7.5%, the most of any S&P 500 stock, following reports that the Trump administration planned to make an announcement linking use of the painkiller during pregnancy to autism. A presentation on the matter happened at the White House after the closing bell. Kenvue, the consumer health company that spun off from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in 2023, said that scientific studies show no link between acetaminophen and autism. Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) launched a pair of new features for its Facebook Dating service—an AI assistant that provides support throughout the dating process and a function that offers automatic matches with potential partners based on Facebook's algorithms. Shares of Match Group (MTCH), operator of Tinder, Hinge, and other dating platforms, fell 5.4%. Lennar (LEN) shares fell 4.3% on Monday, extending losses posted Friday after the homebuilder missed quarterly sales and profit forecasts. Following the softer-than-expected earnings results, Raymond James downgraded Lennar stock to "underperform" from "market perform." Analysts suggested that Lennar's margins could remain under pressure, citing the company's use of selling incentives to attract buyers and its elevated on technology and teams.

Shares of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (WAB), a provider of equipment for freight and passenger railway systems, added 4.9%. The company also known as Wabtec announced a deal worth more than $4 billion to deliver 300 of its Evolution Series locomotives to Kazakhstan's national railway company over the coming decade and provide long-term service support. Citi analysts initiated coverage on Wabco stock with a "buy" rating, suggesting the company could benefit from increasing infrastructure investment as well as moves by railroad operators to renew and expand their fleets. Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue (KVUE) dropped 7.5%, the most of any S&P 500 stock, following reports that the Trump administration planned to make an announcement linking use of the painkiller during pregnancy to autism. A presentation on the matter happened at the White House after the closing bell. Kenvue, the consumer health company that spun off from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in 2023, said that scientific studies show no link between acetaminophen and autism. Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) launched a pair of new features for its Facebook Dating service—an AI assistant that provides support throughout the dating process and a function that offers automatic matches with potential partners based on Facebook's algorithms. Shares of Match Group (MTCH), operator of Tinder, Hinge, and other dating platforms, fell 5.4%. Lennar (LEN) shares fell 4.3% on Monday, extending losses posted Friday after the homebuilder missed quarterly sales and profit forecasts. Following the softer-than-expected earnings results, Raymond James downgraded Lennar stock to "underperform" from "market perform." Analysts suggested that Lennar's margins could remain under pressure, citing the company's use of selling incentives to attract buyers and its elevated on technology and teams.

September 22, 2025 16:30 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation LONG BEACH, Calif., Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading launch and space systems company, delivered two Explorer-class spacecraft to Kennedy Space Flight Center for NASA’s Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission, in partnership with the University of California, Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory. Last year Rocket Lab completed the design, build, integration, and testing of the twin spacecraft, named Blue and Gold, in just three and a half years, an accelerated timeline for a Mars mission. This achievement was made possible by Rocket Lab’s mature spacecraft manufacturing experience and its vertically integrated supply chain, which brings production of critical components like solar arrays, star trackers, propellant tanks, reaction wheels, radios, flight software, and more, in-house. ESCAPADE is based on Rocket Lab’s Explorer spacecraft platform, a configurable, high delta-V interplanetary variant of the Company’s advanced family of spacecraft. ESCAPADE is part of NASA’s Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEx) program, designed to deliver high-value planetary science at lower cost and on faster timelines. ESCAPADE will deliver critical Mars science at a fraction of the cost and time of traditional billion-dollar missions. During a 22-month cruise to Mars, Blue and Gold will travel together before entering complementary elliptical orbits around the planet to conduct their science campaigns. The spacecraft will simultaneously capture data from two regions of Mars’ magnetosphere. This unique two-point measurement will allow scientists to understand how the solar wind strips atoms from Mars’ atmosphere, offering insight into the planet’s atmospheric escape history and space weather environment, and informing future human exploration strategies. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “ESCAPADE is a perfect example of why Rocket Lab exists – to make ambitious space science faster and more affordable. Delivering two interplanetary spacecraft on schedule and within budget for a Mars mission is no small feat, and it speaks to the determination and agility of our team. They’ve proven that we can take a concept from design to Mars readiness in just a few short years. This won’t be Rocket Lab’s last time at Mars, with concepts like the Mars Telecommunications Orbiter on the horizon, we’re laying the groundwork for more complex, capable, and essential missions that will support future human exploration.” Rob Lillis, ESCAPADE Principal Investigator and Associate Director for Planetary Science at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, says: “It's been a long road, but we are so excited to be launching Blue & Gold on their mission to understand the Martian space weather environment. Through the usual ups and downs, Rocket Lab has been right alongside NASA and UC Berkeley, supporting us every step of the way on this interplanetary journey." Upon arrival at Kennedy Space Center, Rocket Lab engineers will conduct post-transport inspections and functional tests in the cleanroom before propellant loading and vehicle integration. Launch is scheduled to occur no earlier than this fall on Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket. + Rocket Lab Media ContactLindsay McLaurinmedia@rocketlabusa.com + About Rocket LabRocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads, and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta announced on Monday that it’s bringing an AI assistant to Facebook Dating. This chatbot is intended to help users find matches who are more closely tailored to what they are looking for. For example, Meta might suggest users ask it to find “a Brooklyn girl in tech,” or a user could ask the AI to help refine their profile. Meta also says that it’s “helping people avoid swipe fatigue” with a new feature called Meet Cute, which gives users a weekly “surprise match” chosen based on its algorithm. The company says Facebook Dating matches among adults ages 18 to 29 have increased 10% year-over-year, with hundreds of thousands of users in that age group creating Facebook Dating profiles each month. That’s small compared to competitors like Tinder, which has about 50 million daily active users, and Hinge’s 10 million daily active users. AI features have already become the norm in mainstream dating apps. Even newer dating apps like Sitch have attempted to differentiate themselves with their AI features. Match Group — the owner of Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid, and others — entered a partnership with OpenAI last year, which is part of the dating giant’s $20 million-plus investment in AI. That’s a big bet, especially given the financial struggles of Match Group, which has lost about 68% of its stock price in the last five years. So far, this investment has produced features like an AI photo selector tool for Tinder, which scans your camera roll to help choose profile images, as well as AI-powered matching. Hinge has a feature that lets users improve their responses to profile prompts with AI. Bumble has added similar AI features, and founder Whitney Wolfe Herd even ruffled some feathers last year when she suggested that one day, users could have personal “AI concierges” that go on dates with other people’s AI to determine compatibility.

Title: Levi & Korsinsky Reminds Shareholders of a Lead Plaintiff Deadline of September 30, 2025 in Novo Lawsuit – NVO

September 22, 2025 15:52 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=168441&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases. Our firm has extensive expertise representing investors in complex securities litigation and a team of over 70 employees to serve our clients. For seven years in a row, Levi & Korsinsky has ranked in ISS Securities Class Action Services’ Top 50 Report as one of the top securities litigation firms in the United States.

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/22/2025 12:50:06 PM PDT by whyilovetexas111 Baltic incidents—drones, airspace brushes, GNSS spoofing—could cascade into a NATO–Russia war driven by fear, honor, and interest. Opening phases likely favor NATO in air and sea with superior ISR, EW, and standoff fires; Russia counters with missiles, dense air defenses, cyber, and navigation attacks. Two plausible endgames emerge: a non-nuclear grind to an armistice shaped by attrition and political risk, or limited nuclear use to coerce termination, shattering the taboo and accelerating crisis instability.

Nobody wins, everybody loses, especially the U.S. taxpayer! Blackrock and the Finks of the world win. They get to rape taxpayers for weapons contracts, then get the re-construction contracts, and then get dibs on resources. Ivan, you’re in our airspace! Turn 180 and fly east to exit! No one can predict military outcomes, maybe that’s why I found the article to be ridiculous. It says NATO would just want to preserve alliance territory. And Russia would just want an aftermath where it has more influence over Europe. Hogwash. Russia would seek to hold as much of Eastern and Western Europe as possible. NATO would need to stop the Russian invasion by defeating the Russian army. Would it lead to nuclear exchanges? Depends. If Russia wants to go scorched earth they will use nukes at the outset or as soon as they suffer setbacks. Most likely both sides would try to keep it conventional, in which case Russia would seize some easy territory and then be defeated by the US and NATO. They are no match for our air force for starters. They can’t move on the ground like us, and right now they are tied down in Ukraine. Their navy? Please. If this is part of a coordinated attack with China, all bets are off and it’s balls to the walls on all fronts. That’s why we need to deter this stuff through strength. Russia has all they can handle fighting Ukraine. If the war spreads, Russia will fragment. On 24 November 2015, a Turkish Air Force F-16 fighter jet shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24M attack aircraft near the Syria–Turkey border. According to Turkey, the aircraft was fired upon while in Turkish airspace because it violated the border up to a depth of 2.19 kilometres (1.36 miles) for about 17 seconds after being warned to change its heading ten times over a period of five minutes before entering the airspace Get the US out of NATO. This isn’t our battle. It’s Europe’s. I’m sick and tired of wasting my taxpayer dollars on proxy wars with Russia. “...that’s why I found the article to be ridiculous. The editor in chief of the NSJ has been published in the NY Times and CNN. Not to be trusted with anything. wy69 China. The rump UK empire/EU-Davos are collapsing Their last desperate act will be to start war, especially involving the United States. We'll See. I think Putun is stress-testing the alliance. He suspects Germans will not die to defend Estonians. He suspects Trump will be disappointed but unwilling to defend them. And re-absorbing the Baltics rights what he considers a historic wrong since he considers the Baltics to be historically Russian. And, he can say he is defending the rights of Russian speakers there. Weakness invites him to roll the dice. The MIC Why should the US sacrifice everything for the MUSLIM CALIPHATE of Western Europe? Let’s be honest: Western Europe has fallen to Islam and the WEF (WEF supports sharia). Poland, Hungary and Slovakia are standing strong against the Sharia-friendly EUSSR, but the US cannot afford to pay for another stupid war, nor do Americans want our troops dying in vain. Of course, if it goes nuclear, none of this matters. And, I really don’t want to witness a nuclear holocaust for Ukraine. We keep hearing this Boomer braggadocio about mighty NATO. Meanwhile, the West is still failing on the basics like artillery ammunition production. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZcZrPWlZbQ it won’t happen I think this is what we are seeing. a series of events, possible false flags, hyped into a justification for more overt involvement against russia, then a cry of article 5 when things happen. some of the pictures from poland of the drones make little credible sense. drones clearly photo-staged in places they didn’t land, duct tape on them, etc. Europe in general does not want this to stop, and they will force trumps hand on it. they are doing so now. If Russia can’t defeat Ukraine and has most of its army bogged down there, how the hell would it then take on all the members of NATO including the United States? Has nothing to do with braggadocia. With the commitment of all the Western air forces including the US? With the US Navy battle groups committed? With the US and Europe on a war footing? Russia can’t defeat Ukraine, it made a mess of that campaign, with what additional army would it take on all the countries of NATO? why do you think Russia constantly threatened nuclear war (sort of) if NATO became involved? Why do you think Russia has tolerated direct attacks on its forces and facilities inside Russia? In addition to being an idiot, Putin knows Russia cannot take On NATO. He might try to grab the Baltics if he thinks NATO will back down rather than fight him. Whatever. Show me any recent analysis that has Russia defeating NATO in a conventional war. That’s what the article was addressing, wasn’t it? Trump is not weakness. And we are preparing for Putin to invade the Baltics.

Nvidia and OpenAI's business relationship is entering a new phase. The chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom and world's most valuable company said Monday it plans to invest up to $100 billion in ChatGPT maker OpenAI to build out AI data centers. Nvidia (NVDA) shares gained close to 4% following the news, making the stock one of the best performers in the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 Monday afternoon. Several Nvidia partners, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Micron Technology (MU), saw their shares rise along with companies that make equipment to manufacture chips, boosting the tech sector. "This investment and infrastructure partnership mark the next leap forward—deploying 10 gigawatts to power the next era of intelligence," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a release. Nvidia said the first of those 10 gigawatts is expected to be deployed in the second half of next year, on its next-generation Vera Rubin platform. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said it will use what it's building with Nvidia to "create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale." The companies added they expect to finalize the details of the partnership in the coming weeks. With Monday's gains, Nvidia shares have added more than a third of their value since the start of the year.

Title: Google enters second court battle against DOJ over alleged monopoly
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-ad-tech-monopoly-trial-remedy/
Time Published: 2025-09-22T16:44:46Z

Watch CBS News September 22, 2025 / 12:44 PM EDT / AP After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department's attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising. The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue. Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a "remedy" trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions. Although the judge hasn't set a timetable for making that decision, it's unlikely to come down before the end of this year because additional legal briefs and courtroom arguments are expected to extend into November before Brinkema takes the matter under submission. No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can't be filed until the remedy is determined. The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive. If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology — a proposal that the company's lawyers warned would "invite disruption and damage" to consumers and the internet's ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years. Google believes it has already made enough changes to its "Ad Manager" system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling. The legal battle over Google's advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct. In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month. Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist — a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion — an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April. In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial. As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's "radical" proposals. The Justice Department is "fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed," Google's lawyers argued leading up to the trial. © 2025 The Associated Press.

Title: Adani Group Plans Leverage Cut, Sees No Dollar Bond Until 2027

Time Published: 2025-09-22T16:32:05Z
Full Content:
Indian conglomerate Adani Group aims to cut its leverage over the next five years and has no plans to issue bonds in international capital markets until 2027. The group’s next foreign currency bond sale will likely be a dollar bond, said group Chief Financial Officer Jugeshinder Singh. Issuances in the domestic market as well as Reg D issuances, where borrowers can sell securities without having to register them with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, will continue. The billionaire Gautam Adani-led group, which is among the largest Indian issuers of dollar bonds, will work to pare its leverage until 2030, Singh said, speaking in an interview in London. The measures would reinforce an effort by Adani to introduce more financial discipline to its balance sheet after bond spreads widened in the wake of a short-seller report in 2023 and an investigation into an alleged bribery scheme by the US Department of Justice the following year, which the group has denied. India’s securities market regulator on Thursday cleared the group’s founder of some allegations raised by the short-seller. Singh said Adani “aims to reduce the leverage level of portfolio companies to a level similar to established utilities in OECD member countries than emerging markets levels.” Adani is cutting leverage because it has become “counterproductive” to hold too much cash on its balance sheet, especially after positive rating actions. Even though the group’s net debt has risen in recent years, a faster level of earnings growth has driven down leverage from a peak in the 2022 fiscal year. Net debt was about 2.37 trillion rupees ($26.9 billion) for the 2025 fiscal year, while the net debt to EBITDA ratio, a measure of leverage, was 2.63 times, according to a credit update note published by the conglomerate in August. That’s down from 3.81 times three years prior. Earlier this year, the ports unit began buying back some of its outstanding debt. Still, Adani will have to balance its effort to cut leverage with ambitious capital spending plans and a recent spate of private debt deals from lenders including Apollo Global Management Inc., Metlife Inc., and BlackRock Inc. At the annual meeting of the flagship company earlier this year, founder Gautam Adani touted plans to spend between $15 and $20 billion annually over the next five years. In November, Adani said in a post on X that the group would invest $10 billion in US energy security and infrastructure projects. Singh said the group doesn’t need to borrow the finance the $10 billion investment plans in the U.S. as the expenditure is within the group’s ‘cash envelope,’ referring to cash generated by companies, and it represents a small portion of the group’s broader spending plans over the next five to six years.

Last year saw more than 150,000 job cuts across 549 companies, according to independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. So far this year, more than 22,000 workers have been the victim of reductions across the tech industry, with a staggering 16,084 cuts taking place in February alone. We’re tracking layoffs in the tech industry in 2025 so you can see the trajectory of the cutbacks and understand the impact on innovation across all types of companies. As businesses continue to embrace AI and automation, this tracker serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs — and what could be at stake with increased innovation. Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known tech layoffs that have occurred in 2025, which will be updated regularly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here. Laid off about a third of its data annotation team, cutting roughly 500 jobs, according to Business Insider. The move comes as the company shifts focus from generalist AI tutors to specialist roles, after testing workers to assess their strengths. Employees were told they’ll be paid through the end of their contracts — or November 30 at the latest — but their system access was cut immediately, Business Insider reports. Has reportedly laid off about 200 workers, or 1.5% of its staff, as the company braces for the end of federal EV tax credits under President Trump’s policy changes. The $7,500 incentive for new electric cars expires this month, adding to pressure from cooling demand. Despite the cuts, Rivian says it’s moving ahead with plans for a lower-cost model. Is cutting another 101 jobs in Seattle and 262 in San Francisco, just weeks after a wave of layoffs in August. The company, which had about 3,900 local employees before the cuts, hasn’t explained the move and declined to comment. Is trimming another 262 jobs at its San Francisco headquarters, according to a state filing, with layoffs set to take effect November 3. The move comes just weeks after CEO Marc Benioff touted AI’s potential to cut customer support roles, and follows a smaller round of cuts in Seattle and Bellevue earlier this month. Will eliminate 221 positions across its Milpitas and San Francisco offices, including 157 in Santa Clara County and 64 in San Francisco, effective October 13, according to filings with California’s Employment Development Department reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. The cuts are part of the company’s broader workforce-reduction strategy. Laid off about 100 employees last month, around 9% of its workforce, after falling short of ambitious growth targets. The cuts affected staff across all departments. The company provides back-office software for restaurant chains. Is set to cut 101 jobs at its Santa Clara location, with notices issued on August 13 and terminations effective October 13. The company, which recently disclosed nearly 200 layoffs at its Pleasanton and Redwood City offices, is also planning to lay off 161 employees in Seattle, according to filings with the Washington state Employment Security Department. Is cutting 106 positions at its Seattle and Liberty Lake, Washington, offices, according to a state Employment Security Department filing. The layoffs, which affected senior engineers and managers, are part of a broader global workforce reduction, although the security and application delivery company has not disclosed the total number of employees affected. Will cut 6% of its workforce in its sixth layoff in just over a year. Peloton CEO Peter Stern said the cuts are needed to improve long-term business health. Is cutting 10% of its workforce, or about 70 employees, as part of a cost-saving effort to reduce operating expenses by $8.5 million, marking its third round of layoffs since 2022. The corporate video software company plans to maintain and gradually grow its sales and marketing budgets, driven by a robust pipeline and growing adoption of its AI-powered offerings. Is laying off about 200 employees, roughly 34% of its global workforce, as it shuts down its email and SMS marketing operations. The Israeli-founded unicorn is partnering with Attentive and Omnisend to continue supporting marketing services while investing in AI-powered tools like automated review summaries, smart sorting, and a new Loyalty Tiers system. Laid off 30 employees and is now offering buyouts to the remaining 200. The AI coding startup recently acquired by Cognition has had a rocky stretch, including a near-acquisition by OpenAI and a reverse-acqui-hire by Google that saw key talent depart before Cognition stepped in. Despite initial promises to value Windsurf’s team, the deal now looks more focused on the startup’s intellectual property than its people. Is cutting 100 jobs, and its CEO, Jen Sargent, is departing. Amazon is reorganizing its audio operations, moving Wondery’s audio-only podcasts under Audible and placing video-focused shows into a new Creator Services division. Amazon acquired Wondery in 2020. Has cut 150 roles in customer service and support, following enhancements to its platform and tools that have significantly reduced support needs. The decision came via a prerecorded message from CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes, just hours before co-founder Scott Farquhar urged Australia to embrace an “AI revolution” and move beyond “jobs of the past” in an Australian Press Club address. The Australian software firm was founded 2002. Is cutting about 7% of its workforce, or 47 employees, as part of a push toward profitability, Bloomberg reports. The decision follows the recent acquisition of a startup with around 30 staff, who will stay on with the company. Despite the cuts, the blockchain software company that operates the popular digital wallet MetaMask says it will continue hiring for select roles. Is shutting down operations, per a report by Business Insider. The social collaging platform aimed at creators was founded in 2019 and raised $9 million in funding. Its closure highlights the persistent challenges social media startups face in building user bases and achieving long-term growth. Is laying off around 200 employees — roughly 14% of its workforce — and severing ties with 500 global contractors. The cuts come just weeks after Meta brought in the data-labeling startup’s CEO in a $14.3 billion deal. Plans to cut more than 100 U.S. full-time jobs, about 3% of its workforce, including positions at its Morrisville, North Carolina, campus. As of February 2024, the PC maker employed around 5,100 workers in the U.S. Is reportedly planning to lay off nearly 2,400 workers in Oregon, which is almost five times more than what was announced earlier this week. Last week, Intel announced that it will lay off more than 500 employees in Oregon, which is about 20% of its workforce, per Bloomberg. Plan to eliminate approximately 1,300 jobs combined as part of a larger restructuring effort to combine their operations and focus on AI. The layoff will mostly affect employees in the U.S., particularly in the R&D, HR, and sustainability teams, according to an internal memo by Hisayuki “Deko” Idekoba, the CEO of Recruit Holdings, which is the Japanese parent company of Indeed and Glassdoor. Has laid off 29 employees as part of its reorganization, per a report by Blockworks. The Seattle-based research and engineering startup recently launched EigenCloud, a platform that provides blockchain-level trust guarantees for any Web 2.0 or web3 application. The reduction will affect 25% of the company’s workforce. Eigen Labs said it had raised $70 million in tokens from a16z Crypto in June. Will cut 9,000 employees, which is less than 4% of its global workforce across teams, role types, and geographies. The reduction follows a series of layoffs earlier this year: It cut less than 1% of the headcount in January, more than 6,000 in May, and at least 300 in June. Is laying off 65 employees in Bellevue, Washington, according to media reports. The parent company of TikTok arrived in Seattle in 2021 and has been expanding its presence there by growing its TikTok Shop online shopping division. Announced on June 30 that the company is cutting 300 jobs, or 10% of its workforce, as part of organizational restructuring within its sales and support divisions amid the AI shift.

The move comes as new Hightower CEO Larry Restieri starts putting his stamp on the firm after years of rampant acquisition. September 22, 2025 Hightower Advisors, the Chicago-based mega-RIA with $326 billion in client assets, has hired a former BlackRock executive as head of operations and services amid a push to boost connectivity between advisors and the home office. Patrick Dunne has joined Hightower as a managing director and head of operations and service. According to his LinkedIn, Dunne’s most recent role has been as founder and lead of BlueGranite, an investor working to “scale” fintech and investment firms. Earlier in his career, he held various leadership roles at BlackRock, including head of iShares global markets and investments. “We are pleased to welcome Patrick Dunne to Hightower,” a spokesperson said via email. “His experience scaling complex organizations will help accelerate our ongoing investment in operational excellence—making it easier for advisors to serve clients.” According to filings, Dunne will join with an equity stake in Hightower, which is majority owned by private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners. In separate news, Charis Jones, Hightower's executive director of compliance, has left the firm for a new position that, according to a LinkedIn post, she will announce soon. Hightower did not respond to a request for comment on whether they are replacing the role. Related:TradePMR Offers 0.5% Asset Match on New Deposits for RIA Clients Changes at the mega-RIA come as new CEO Larry Restieri begins to make his mark on the firm. The former CEO of Goldman Sachs’ Ayco business was named the new head in February to take over from Bob Oros, who remains on the firm’s board. His official start was in June. Restieri hired State Street alum Randy Bullard in one of his early moves to lead a new centralized investment management platform. The platform is designed to provide Hightower’s roughly 660 advisors with institutional research and investment counsel from the recent Hightower acquisition of NEPC, an institutional consulting firm and outsourced chief investment officer. “We expect our advisors will choose to adopt the centralized investments platform because of its compelling features, products, and the improved client experience that it will offer our practices; importantly, though, it will be the advisors’ choice to adopt the central platform, not a requirement,” a spokesperson said. “It’s just one of the ways Larry envisions delivering enhancements for advisors.” The RIA has more “advancements for advisors” in the coming months, the spokesperson said. In the meantime, Restieri is working to create more collaboration between advisors and the home office. He has been speaking with Hightower advisors about creating “regional support to help advisory practices collaborate and work more closely together with each other and with home office specialists,” according to a spokesperson. “This regional approach does not represent a consolidation strategy but is a way to better engage and support our practices.” Related:Pennsylvania-Based Institutional and Wealth Firms Combine to Form $9B Shop Citywire had previously reported that Hightower was pursuing a regional consolidation strategy, citing sources. Restieri takes over after Oros led years of acquisitions for Hightower. Oros joined in 2019, replacing founder Elliot Weissbluth, who built Hightower primarily from wirehouse breakaway advisors. Under Oros, the firm shifted to acquiring RIAs with private equity funding. During his tenure, the firm made over 50 acquisitions.

Title: Google faces antitrust déjà vu as US seeks to break up its digital advertising business

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Technology Writer After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department’s attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising. The trial that opened Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court revolves around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google’s digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue. Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a “remedy” trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions. “The purpose of a remedy is doing what is necessary to restore competition,” said Julia Tarver Wood in an opening statement for the DOJ’s antitrust division. Wood said that the Google is manipulating the market in a way that is antithetical to free market competition. “The means to cheat are buried in computer codes and algorithms,” Wood said. An attorney for Google, Karen Dunn, countered that the remedy proposed by the government is reckless and radical, and that the DOJ is attempting to remove Google entirely from the competition.

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Technology Writer After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department’s attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising. The trial that opened Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court revolves around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google’s digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue. Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a “remedy” trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions. “The purpose of a remedy is doing what is necessary to restore competition,” said Julia Tarver Wood in an opening statement for the DOJ’s antitrust division. Wood said that the Google is manipulating the market in a way that is antithetical to free market competition. “The means to cheat are buried in computer codes and algorithms,” Wood said. An attorney for Google, Karen Dunn, countered that the remedy proposed by the government is reckless and radical, and that the DOJ is attempting to remove Google entirely from the competition. No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can’t be filed until the remedy is determined. The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden’s administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business.

Title: Microsoft reacts to President Trump's shocking $100K H-1B visa fee — "creating anxiety and uncertainty"

Time Published: 2025-09-22T14:05:00Z

There's a lot of confusion surrounding the new $100,000 H-1B visa fee announced this past weekend. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Some of the world's largest tech companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, had a busy weekend scrambling to provide proper guidance for employees following US President Trump's announced $100,000 H-1B visa fee. The executive order, signed by President Trump on Friday, September 19, went into effect on Sunday, September 21. Microsoft was quick to release a memo to affected employees on Saturday explaining the situation. According to an internal memo (via Business Insider), Microsoft advised H-1B employees currently in the US to remain in place. The advisory for H-1B employees caught outside the US at the time of the proclamation is much more frenzied: If you are in H-1B or H-4 status and are currently outside the U.S., we strongly recommend that you do what you can to return to the U.S. tomorrow before the deadline. The Proclamation was released within the last 30 minutes, so we realize that there isn't much time to make sudden travel arrangements. But again, we strongly encourage you to do your best to return. If you are not able to return, please use this form to let us know about your situation. Please only complete that form if you are outside of the U.S. We want to be able to follow up with each individual and provide support and guidance as they try to return within the next 28 hours. Although H-4 dependents weren't included in President Trump's proclamation, Microsoft also recommended that those employees remain in the US. For those with other visa statuses, including L-1 and TN, Microsoft states that the proclamation will not have any impact. Microsoft adds that it knows "these developments are creating anxiety and uncertainty for many of you," and it asks "that you prioritize the recommendations above" despite the company not having "all of the answers right now." All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Similar memos were released by Amazon and Google, emphasizing the importance of these H-1B visas in the tech industry that relies so heavily on skilled foreign workers. Friday's press conference, in which President Trump and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick laid out the new plans for H-1B visas, caused a lot of confusion. At first, it seemed like the executive order would install a yearly $100,000 fee for H-1B visa employees. It also seemed like those with H1-B visas outside the US at the time the proclamation went into effect would be affected. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt provided an update on X on Saturday afternoon — well after associated memos from big tech companies went out and employees scrambled to find flights back to the US — stating that "this is NOT an annual fee" and that "those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter." To be clear:1.) This is NOT an annual fee. It’s a one-time fee that applies only to the petition.2.) Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter. H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the…September 20, 2025 Of course, Leavitt's update comes with a Community Note pointing out that "Lutnick repeatedly said in an Oval Office briefing that this was an annual fee." The H-1B visa program was created in 1990 and was designed as a way to grant temporary worker status in the US. It does not grant residency. Since its inception, companies have used H-1B visas to fill roles with foreign workers that cannot otherwise be filled by US workers. There are 65,000 H-1B visas available each year for workers with at least a bachelor's degree, as well as 20,000 for workers with advanced degrees. The visas can be approved for three to six years. According to a White House press release explaining the proclamation: The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security. Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors, have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Up until President Trump's weekend executive order, H-1B visa costs included a $215 filing fee and a $780 sponsor fee, paid when the employer submitted a petition to the government to receive a visa. Amazon might have received the most H-1B visa applications in 2025, but Microsoft is in second place. The official White House proclamation didn't name names, but it didn't exactly obfuscate either: One software company was approved for over 5,000 H-1B workers in FY 2025; around the same time, it announced a series of layoffs totaling more than 15,000 employees. Another IT firm was approved for nearly 1,700 H-1B workers in FY 2025; it announced it was laying off 2,400 American workers in Oregon in July. A third company has reduced its workforce by approximately 27,000 American workers since 2022, while being approved for over 25,000 H-1B workers since FY 2022. A fourth company reportedly eliminated 1,000 jobs in February; it was approved for over 1,100 H-1B workers for FY 2025. That "one software company" approved for 5,000 H-1B visas does indeed seem to refer to Microsoft, which in 2025 experienced five months of layoffs totalling more than 15,000 employees, including 6,000 jobs in May and 9,000 in July.

Title: Household resilience and its role in sustaining food security in rural Bangladesh
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0332868

Food insecurity and agriculture in South Asia, including Bangladesh, pose significant threats to the well-being and livelihoods of its people. Building adaptive capacities and resilient food systems is crucial for sustainable livelihoods. This study employs the Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis II framework to construct a Resilience Capacity Index (RCI) and analyze its relationship with food security using data from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey 2018. The study applies Exploratory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling to examine the impact of key resilience components such as Access to Basic Services, Adaptive Capacity, and Assets on household resilience. The findings reveal that access to basic services, land assets, and farm equipment positively influences households’ resilience capacity. However, the presence of livestock assets has a negative impact, potentially due to market volatility, climate vulnerability, and disease outbreaks. Additionally, adaptive capacity has a positive but insignificant influence on RCI, suggesting that without enhancing economic opportunities, institutional support, and inclusive development strategies, adaptive capacity could not be enough to foster resilience. However, resilient capacity enhances food security metrics such as the Food Consumption Score and Expenditure. These findings underscore the importance of policies that focus on increasing and maintaining access to basic services, promoting sustainable land management practices, and strengthening social safety nets. This study emphasizes the importance of focusing on livestock assets to ensure their sustainability by stabilizing the livestock market, improving veterinary services, and providing subsidies to reduce maintenance costs.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Food consumption is a fundamental human need, and a global concern, characterized by a surplus of food in some regions and scarcity in others. It stands as a cornerstone of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), notably SDG-1 (No Hunger) [1]. Achieving food security, which ensures an end to hunger, is essential for human well-being [2]. According to the World Food Summit, food security entails access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food [3]. However, food security is a multifaceted issue intertwined with trade, politics, history, health and nutrition [4]. Countries reliant on imports are often vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market, as international trade can directly affect food accessibility and price stability [5,6]. Political instability and conflict can severely disrupt food production and distribution systems, as observed in countries like Somalia and Yemen [7]. Food systems and access continue to be shaped by historical legacies of colonialism and unequal land distribution, particularly in many developing countries [8]. Moreover, malnutrition exacerbates health vulnerabilities, while poor health undermines households’ capacity to produce or procure food, creating a cyclical relationship [9,10]. Achieving food security, therefore, requires nutrition-sensitive systems that go beyond meeting calorie needs to ensure dietary diversity and adequate nutrient intake [11,12]. Food insecurity, on the other hand, refers to limited or uncertain access to adequate and nutritious food, and the inability to obtain food in socially acceptable ways [13]. It represents a complex challenge that affects individuals and communities worldwide. Many developing countries, including Bangladesh, have recently experienced acute food insecurity. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a collaborative initiative involving governments, non-governmental organizations, UN Agencies, civil society and other relevant actors, approximately 9.14 million individuals, or 20% of the population, are categorized in Phases 3 and 4 [14]. These phases indicate high levels of acute food insecurity in certain parts of Bangladesh. The poorest households in these areas face significant challenges exacerbated by factors such as high inflation, reduced earnings, and frequent climate-related shocks, which contribute to the severity of food insecurity among the population [14]. The frequency and intensity of natural, economic, and political hazards affecting individuals, businesses, economies, and even entire nations are increasing [15–19]. The concept of resilience has thus gained prominence in governmental and research contexts. Initially introduced in ecology literature by Holling [20], resilience has since been studied and applied across various fields, including socioeconomics [21]. Resilience is commonly defined as the capacity to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from shocks efficiently and effectively [22]. Recent studies have expanded this definition to include the ability to manage persistent risk exposure [23]. In the context of food security analysis, resilience refers to the latent capacity of households to withstand and navigate socioeconomic factors, climate variability, and other shocks [24]. Traditionally viewed as an endpoint, resilience is now understood as a continuous process that can either enhance or diminish response capacities, thereby impacting overall well-being [25]. Resilient food systems are adept at adapting to new conditions while maintaining stable food production and ensuring access for vulnerable populations. They mitigate the impact of shocks and stressors, with social and economic factors playing crucial roles in enhancing resilience. In countries like Bangladesh, where a significant portion of the population relies on agriculture, food insecurity remains a pressing concern. The food system is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on a few staple crops such as rice, wheat, and maize, and its interconnectedness with the global food supply chain [14,26–28]. Disruptions in one part of the system can lead to cascading effects throughout. Moreover, the lack of agricultural diversity and reliance on intensive monoculture practices increase vulnerability to pests, diseases, and climate shocks. Bangladesh is particularly susceptible to extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods and droughts [29], which can severely impact food production and access [30]. Assessing the resilience of communities and households to shocks and threats is crucial as it allows nations to anticipate and effectively address these challenges. Resilience assessments help policymakers and organisations understand how well a community can rebound from adversity. Food security, with its multifaceted and complex nature, has predominantly been studied through vulnerability assessments. However, the methodologies used in these assessments often lack dynamism, which makes precise predictions of potential shocks and incidents challenging [31–33]. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) developed the Resilience Index Measurement Analysis (RIMA) to quantify resilience [6,34,35]. This method introduces the concept that resilience can be estimated as a latent variable through a two-step procedure involving observable factors, even when resilience itself is not immediately observable [33]. Recent advancements by FAO have enhanced this approach by using structural equation modelling instead of factor analysis to estimate the resilience index. Additionally, more variables have been included as proxies to represent institutional and natural environments [36]. Applying the RIMA-II model in Bangladesh offers a novel, structured econometric approach to measuring household resilience, an aspect largely absent in previous food security studies. Unlike traditional vulnerability assessments that rely on static indicators, RIMA-II conceptualizes resilience as a latent variable, allowing for a more nuanced and dynamic analysis of the factors influencing resilience capacity. While RIMA-II has been applied in various regions, its use in Bangladesh remains limited, with most existing studies focusing on food security determinants [37,38] or coping strategies [39–48] rather than the interactions among resilience components. Furthermore, prior research lacks a comprehensive resilience index beyond traditional vulnerability assessments, limiting its ability to capture the complex interconnections among resilience factors. Thus, this study makes two main contributions. Firstly, it investigates the key determinants shaping the resilience capacity of households, which influence their ability to adapt and recover from adverse conditions. Second, it assesses how resilience capacity translates into improved food security outcomes. By situating this analysis within the broader context of rural livelihoods, the study aims to provide empirical insights into the mechanisms through which resilience serves as a buffer against food insecurity, offering implications for policy interventions aimed at fostering sustainable rural development. When attempting to understand and enhance resilience, it is crucial to provide necessary resources and techniques to mitigate adverse outcomes, predict and prepare for shocks and stress, eliminate destructive coping mechanisms, and facilitate recovery [49]. Resilience in environmental and socioeconomic systems is demonstrated by responses to negative events and shocks [21], which encompass transformation, adaptation, and absorption responses [50–53]. Resilience, viewed as an intermediate outcome in socioeconomic studies, integrates capacities such as a household’s or community’s ability to cope with shocks [53]. Recent studies have endeavoured to integrate resilience into various development contexts, including food safety [22,54], well-being [55,56], rural development [57–59], and sustainable livelihoods [60–62]. The articles by [32,33] represent early efforts to define and quantify household resilience in the context of food insecurity. These studies focused on the household as the primary unit of analysis, recognising that crucial decisions regarding risk management made at this level, both before and after adverse events impacting food security [33] introduced a resilience index, treated as a latent variable that cannot be directly observed, and employed a two-stage factor analysis approach using measurable variables. Building on this framework [63] applied a similar latent variable model to measure resilience in Northern Bangladesh, highlighting the importance of comprehensively understanding resilience factors across various capacities. Additionally, d’Errico et al. investigated how shocks, particularly conflicts and climate events, influence resilience measurement [24]. Similarly, Ciani et al. aimed to assess household resilience to food insecurity in a changing environment using principal components and multivariate analysis of panel data. Their resilience index indicated that small landowners and agricultural wage workers exhibited lower resilience levels compared to other livelihood groups [64]. Dhraief et al. conducted a cross-sectional survey employing factor analysis and regression models. Their findings highlighted the significant roles of income and food access, adaptive capacity, and social safety nets in enhancing household resilience, as evidenced by their positive correlations with the resilience index [65]. Conversely, asset possession and climate change showed negative associations with household resilience in their study. However, contrasting findings in other studies have indicated that assets can have positive and notable effects [49,66,67]. Rural households generally exhibit less resilient to food shortages compared to urban and peri-urban households [68]. However, during the COVID-19 lockdowns, urban households experienced higher levels of food insecurity than rural households, yet they were more likely to resort to financial and food-compromising coping strategies [48]. Sassi et al. argued that households often turn to less preferred and cheaper food options during times of food insecurity, which can lead to long-term societal impacts and reduced ability to cope [69]. Large family households are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity, often relying on lower-quality meals and support from family or friends [70]. Ownership of assets also plays a crucial role in the resilience of smallholder farmers, with households possessing more assets generally exhibiting greater resilience to food insecurity [66]. Food-secure households typically exhibit higher dietary diversity and rely less on coping mechanisms, benefitting from adaptive and absorptive resilience capacities along with sufficient income [71]. Previous studies have highlighted that household resilience to food insecurity is influenced by factors such as income, assets, social safety nets, and adaptive capacity, with resilience levels varying across different livelihood groups and geographic locations [32,34,72,73]. However, findings on the role of assets remain inconclusive, calling for a more nuanced approach that differentiates asset types to better capture their distinct contributions to resilience. Despite the growing use of resilience measurement frameworks, studies in Bangladesh have yet to adopt a comprehensive approach that captures the interplay between various resilience components. Although prior research has identified the resilience determinants [48,63,74], few studies have specifically examined the suitability of RIMA-II for the Bangladeshi context [75]. Traditional vulnerability assessments often fail to account for critical dimensions such as access to services, adaptive strategies, and the differential roles of asset types as drivers of resilience. This study addresses these gaps by employing RIMA-II to systematically measure resilience as a latent construct, offering a more integrated and nuanced approach compared to earlier methods in rural Bangladesh. A key contribution of this research is the disaggregation of asset components, land, livestock, and farm equipment, to assess their distinct effects on resilience. This disaggregation is essential, as each asset type contributes differently to resilience in rural Bangladesh. Land ownership is vital for food production and long-term economic stability [76–78], while livestock assets, despite their perceived benefits, introduce risks related to market volatility [79–81], disease outbreaks [82–88], and climate vulnerability [89–92]. Farm equipment, on the other hand, plays a key role in mechanization and agricultural efficiency, making it distinct from the other asset categories [93–97]. Treating assets as a single, aggregate variable would overlook these critical differences in how they contribute to or detract from resilience. This approach ensures a more accurate and policy-relevant analysis of household resilience dynamics in Bangladesh. Furthermore, the use of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to validate resilience determinants has been rare in prior research, emphasizing the need for this methodological advancement. By combining RIMA-II with a robust empirical framework, this study advances the understanding of resilience pathways and generates policy-relevant insights for improving food security in Bangladesh. It is increasingly recognised that one of the most effective ways to reduce or even avert food security crises is to create more resilient livelihoods [24,49]. The Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis (RIMA) was developed within this framework, with pioneering contributions by the FAO [34]. Employing a novel quantitative methodology, RIMA helps explain why and how certain households can withstand shocks and stressors more effectively than others. Resilience, being a multidimensional concept that cannot be directly observed, must be assessed through proxies by focusing on the needs of the most vulnerable groups. The new RIMA-II methodology offers enhanced guidance for successfully planning, implementing, overseeing, and assessing aid. The RIMA II model was employed to identify and study household resilience [36]. The RIMA-II model enables a better understanding of households` circumstances and needs, as well as identifying potential areas for improving future assistance. Access to Basic Services (ABS), Assets (AST), and Adaptive Capacity (AC) are the widely recognised pillars of the Resilience Capacity Index (RCI). Due to the lack of available data on Social Safety Nets (SSNs), our study focuses on the other three pillars. To estimate each pillar, variables were considered based on a literature review, data availability, context analysis, and statistical properties. ABS refers to the ability to meet households’ basic needs and encompasses the quality, effectiveness, and access to basic services [98]. This study assesses ABS through the following components: floor type (X1), wall type (X2), housing condition (X3), roof type (X4), sanitation type (X5), source of water (X6), cooking fuel type (X7), distance to health facilities from residence (in kilometers) (X8) and distance to the market (in kilometers) (X9). AC refers to a household’s ability to cope with and adapt to an unfamiliar situation, enabling them to maintain everyday affairs without long-term disruptions [32,36]. It indicates that more adaptive residents can handle adverse situations without reducing their standard of living [49,99]. In this study, this pillar includes the following components: household head`s employment location (X10), household head`s occupation type (X11), savings (X12), household income per month (X13), household head`s education year (X14), and diversified sources of income (X15). An essential prerequisite for shock response is AST, the second pillar of the RIMA-II model [32]. Assets encompass a household’s income-producing and not-producing assets [98], serving as indicators of the household’s economic circumstances and providing insight into the impact of shocks on households. The proxies used to construct AST include land holding (in decimal) (X16), land value (X17), livestock value (X18), livestock quantity (X19), farm equipment value (X20), farm equipment quantity (X21), and non-agricultural asset value (X22). The RIMA-II is divided into two sections: a descriptive and a causal analysis [98]. The RCI used to assess households and inform policy, is generated through descriptive analysis. The RCI is constructed in two stages. The first stage, the formative model, employs factor analysis of observable variables to estimate attributes (pillars) of resilience. The second stage, the measurement model, utilizes a Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model to calculate the RCI based on these pillars while considering the relationships between RCI and food security indicators. The developmental model links resilience to the pillars, while the measurement model focuses on food security indicators such as the Food Consumption Score (FCS) and Food Expenditure (FX). Food Consumption Score (FCS) collects household-level data on the diversity and frequency of food groups consumed over seven days. This data is weighted according to the relative nutritional value of each food group. The main food groups and their respective weights are: staples (weight 2), pulses (weight 3), vegetables (weight 1), fruit (weight 1), meat/fish (weight 4), milk (weight 4), sugar (weight 0.5) and oil (weight 0.5). To calculate FCS, the first step is to sum the consumption frequencies of food items within each group. Next, each food group`s total is multiplied by its respective weight [100]. Food Expenditure (FX) refers to the total cost of food obtained, whether purchased or acquired through other means, including both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. This calculation also encompasses food expenditures on dining out at venues such as bars, restaurants, food courts, workplace canteens and street vendors [101]. FX is calculated by multiplying the quantity of food consumed over a seven-day period by its unit price, expressed in Bangladeshi Tk (1 US$ = 110 BDT (Bangladesh Bank, 2024). Based on the literature and the conceptual framework depicted in Fig 1, observable variables are expected to significantly influence latent variables or pillars. Furthermore, these latent variables are expected to have a significant impact on the RCI. Finally, the RCI is expected to significantly influence food security indicators, specifically, FCS and FX. Previous studies [14,15,19,20,25,29,41–43,76–79] have consistently highlighted the substantial influence of various observable variables on latent pillars, the significant impact of latent pillars on RCI, and the consequential effect of RCI on food security. Consequently, this study proposes the following hypotheses: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.g001 The observed variables (X1, X2,.. Xn) used in this study were derived from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS) 2018. This household survey is administered by Data Analysis and Technical Assistance Limited and designed and supervised by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The BIHS sample is statistically representative of rural Bangladesh, covering the nation`s seven administrative divisions: Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet. The survey includes 325 primary sampling units (PSUs) or villages, encompassing a total of 5,604 households in the BIHS dataset. Therefore, this study utilises a cross-sectional dataset of 5,604 households to achieve its research objectives. This dataset serves as the basis for assessing resilience through the pillars of ABS, AC, and AST, and their impact on the RCI and food security indicators. Twenty-two measurement items were used to construct latent pillars of the RCI, which is presented in Appendix Table 1 in S1 File. Each observable variable was assessed using a five-point summated Likert scale, where respondents rated their conditions (1 = very poor; 2 = poor; 3 = moderate; 4 = rich; 5 = very rich). The study utilized a quantitative approach. Initially, descriptive statistics were used to summarize and describe the observable variables of the pillars related to the pillars of resilience and food security indicators. This involved calculating measures such as means, standard deviations, and frequency distributions to provide a clear picture of the characteristics of the data. Statistical factorial analyses were employed to test the study’s hypotheses. To assess the factorial validity of the constructs and explore the latent pillars in the data, exploratory factor analysis was performed following [102]. Given the interconnections among latent constructs, we allowed for inter-factor correlation using the maximum likelihood factor extraction method with orthogonal varimax rotation. Subsequently, structural equation modeling (SEM) was exclusively used for descriptive purposes to understand the explanatory power of the pillars and their relationships with the RCI. This approach is a powerful statistical technique that allows researchers to test complex relationships among variables. It was used in this study to examine the linear correlations between the underlying factors (in this case, the pillars) and the latent variable RCI [103]. The formative model, represented by structural Equation (1), links resilience (η) to the pillars (xi). In contrast, the measurement model, represented by Equation (2), is defined by the Food Consumption Score (FCS) and household food expenditure (FX). The upper portion of the path diagram (Fig 2) illustrates the relationship between the resilience pillars, as measured by error εR, and the disturbance term of the structural estimation. The measuring model is represented by arrows pointing toward the food consumption Score and the food expenditure in the lower half of the structural model. Since the estimated RCI lacks a specific measurement scale, a scale has been proposed with the coefficient of the food consumption loading (˄1) set to 1. This assumption posits that a one standard deviation increase in RCI corresponds to a one standard deviation increase in food intake. This determination also establishes the unit of measurement for the other outcome indicator (˄2), alongside the variance of the two food security indicators, as depicted in Equations (3) and (4): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.g002 The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. It utilized publicly available data from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS), administered by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The BIHS obtained formal written informed consent from all respondents prior to data collection. The summary statistics of all the attributes used to construct the resilience pillars are presented in Appendix Table 2 in S1 File. According to the established criteria [102,104], data is considered normal if kurtosis falls between −7 and +7 and the skewness between −2 and +2. However, our results indicate that some attribute values exceed these thresholds, suggesting potential outliers that may be excluded from further analysis. Cronbach’s alpha assesses with which respondents answer items on a scale or subscale [105]. A Cronbach’s alpha score greater than 0.6 is generally considered reliable with values between 0.6 to 0.8 deemed acceptable [106,107]. The reliability alpha value for the adaptive capacity (AC) pillar significantly exceeded the threshold of 0.70, indicating adequate reliability [105]. The other four pillars also demonstrated reliability, with Cronbach’s alpha values greater than 0.60 [106–108]. Following the initial reliability assessment, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was employed to explore the latent factor structure. The maximum likelihood method was used to identify components and establish the pattern matrix. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was 0.778, surpassing the maximum acceptable level of 0.5 [109]. The criteria, which include a significant correlation matrix determinant of 0.009, a KMO value of 0.778, and a significant Bartlett’s Chi-square of χ2 = 26648.163, p = 0.000, confirmed the adequacy of the sample size chosen for the study [110], indicating sufficient intercorrelation for factorial analysis. Initially identifying ten factors, we retained five factors that collectively explained 82.68% of the total variance in the data, exceeding the acceptable threshold of 60% [102]. Table 1 presents the pattern matrix, demonstrating how each numbered questionnaire item loaded precisely (values above 0.50 on a single component) onto its respective factor. Typically, minimum item-factor loadings of 0.3 to 0.4 are recommended [111–113]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.t001 Table 1 categorizes items X1(floor type), X2 (wall type), and X3 (housing condition) under factor 1 as ABS, explaining 29.74% of the total variance. Factor 2, labelled AC, includes X10 (household head`s employment location) and X11 (household head`s occupation type), explaining 23.49% of the variance. Factors 3 and 4 are labelled Ld_A and Lv_A, respectively, and explain 11.09% and 10.25% of the variance. They comprise items X16 (land size), X17 (land value), X18 (livestock value), and X19 (livestock quantity). Item X20 (farm equipment value) and X21 (farm equipment quantity) of factor 5 are labelled FE. Although factors Ld_A, Lv_A, and FE collectively represent the single factor named Assets (AST), they are labelled as separate factors based on our country’s perspective. The loadings of the items range from 0.51 to 0.92. Table 2 presents the correlation matrix of the five factors included in the analysis. ABS shows significant positive correlations with Ld_A (0.042) and FE (0.034) at the 1% significance level, as these factors contribute to higher income levels that enable households to afford better services. ABS also negatively correlates with AC (0.028) and Lv_A (0.026) at the 5% and 10% significance levels, respectively, possibly due to market volatility and health-related concerns affecting livestock income and service accessibility. AC demonstrates a significant positive correlation with Ld_A (0.023) and Lv_A (0.035) at the 10% and 1% significance levels, respectively, but shows an insignificant correlation with FE (0.017). Ld_A shows a significant positive correlation with both Lv_A (0.047) and FE (0.072) at the 1% level. Lv_A and FE correlate significantly at the 5% level (0.030). Despite the correlations observed among factors, there is no evidence of significant multicollinearity, as no correlation coefficient exceeds 0.8 [114–116]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.t002 Table 3 presents the findings from the multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) model, which was derived using structural equation modelling. In this case, we consider the broader contextual framework to accurately analyze the 2018 data, which includes ongoing food insecurity, a substantial influx of Rohingya refugees facing acute malnutrition amidst monsoon-related hazards, and deep-rooted structural vulnerabilities such as limited agricultural diversification. These factors influenced both households` potential for resilience and the outcomes observed in our SEM model. Study shows that ABS exhibits a significant coefficient of 0.429, indicating that a well-structured living condition with essential facilities enhances households’ resilience capacity. This finding also indicates that households with better access to essential services are more equipped to cope with food insecurity and recover from shocks. Thus, the study’s findings support hypothesis A: access to basic services significantly influences the resilience capacity index. Our results reveal a positive correlation between ABS and RCI (Table 3), consistent with previous studies [32,36,117,118], which suggest that access to basic services enhances economic opportunities, knowledge, and overall well-being, thereby contributing to greater resilience. In contrast, studies by [53,66,119,120] report a negative association, attributing decreasing service quality as households become poorer in their respective countries. Previous studies have often identified AC as a significant influencing factor [24,65,67,121,117]. However, our findings indicate that AC is a positive but insignificant factor, suggesting that institutional and economic barriers impede the effectiveness of this factor. While education, skill development, access to information, and access to credit are critical components of AC, their impact on resilience is highly dependent on external factors such as labor market conditions and institutional access [122,123]. This discrepancy may be attributed to Bangladesh`s high vulnerability to global changes, significant socio-economic challenges, and limitations in institutional capacity [124–126]. In Bangladesh, people are unable to leverage their adaptive skills for resilience due to a lack of employment opportunities [119,125,127,128]. Moreover, limited access to credit, and financial services may restrict households from transferring their adaptive strategies to long-term stability [43,125,128]. Furthermore, gender-based disparities in access to resources and decision-making power also undermine the significance of AC [54,129–133]. As a result, households in Bangladesh may exhibit lower adaptive capacity compared to those in other developing or developed countries [43,47,134,135]. Thus, our results do not support hypothesis B: adaptive capacity significantly influences the resilience capacity index. The “Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis II” report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) discusses how adaptive capacity contributes to resilience but notes that its impact may not always be significant in certain contexts [36]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.t003 The critical role of assets in resilience capacity has been widely recognised, as they constitute the most significant pillar for the RCI. Similar findings have been reported by other authors, such as [49,66,67,119] in the context of Malian and Ethiopian households, highlighting assets as the most pertinent factor for RCI, which aligns with our study findings. However, this study takes a more granular approach to segregating the assets into three distinct categories; land asset, livestock asset, and farm equipment, to identify their unique contributions to resilience building. This disaggregation is crucial, as each asset type plays a unique role in shaping a household`s ability to withstand and recover from food insecurity shocks. In the context of Bangladesh, only a small proportion of households own all three asset types of assets simultaneously, making it essential to analyse their individual and combined impacts on resilience. Our results demonstrate a significant coefficient of 0.119 for Ld_A and 0.042 for FE, indicating a positive influence on RCI, thereby corroborating hypotheses C and E. Land assets are crucial for resilience building as they provide financial stability and income through agriculture [76–78,136]. Additionally, having farm equipment ensures household mechanization and agricultural efficiency, which boosts farm production and enhances household resilience [93–97]. Since these assets play distinct roles in shaping resilience capacity, it is essential to calculate them separately. However, Lv_A demonstrates a significant negative value of 0.053 suggesting that it has a significant negative impact on resilience in Bangladesh. Because it has a high mortality rate of livestock due to natural disasters and high disease outbreaks [137,138]. High vulnerability to climate change may, directly and indirectly, affect livestock production systems, resulting in negative asset values [47,89–92,139–142]. Lv_A are influenced by several interrelated factors that exhibit a counterintuitive negative relationship with resilience, such as market volatility, disease outbreaks, high maintenance cost, and climatic vulnerability. During economic downturns or supply chain disruptions, farmers are forced to sell their livestock at lower prices, undermining their financial stability [79–81]. Disease outbreaks, such as foot-and-mouth disease or avian influenza, frequently affect livestock in Bangladesh, resulting in significant economic losses for rural households. Limited access to veterinary care and inadequate disease prevention measures exacerbate this issue [82–88]. Livestock also involves costly sectors such as feeding, healthcare, and shelter, imposing additional financial burdens on households. While land or farm equipment offers long-term productivity gains, livestock requires continuous investment, making it a riskier asset for resilience building. These combined factors suggest that although livestock is traditionally seen as a liquid asset, it needs more infrastructural development to contribute to long-term resilience in the Bangladeshi context. Consequently, Lv_A cannot verify hypothesis D, which suggests that livestock assets positively influence resilience capacity. Our study indicates that RCI positively influences FCS and FX with significant coefficients of 0.778 and 0.688, respectively. That means households with higher resilience are less likely to experience deteriorating food security and are better positioned to maintain or restore food consumption and expenditure [24]. Policymakers should prioritize resilience-building as a core component of food security programming, employing multidimensional frameworks such as RIMA-II in Bangladesh for targeted, long-term strategies. Our results support hypotheses F and G, which concern the impact of resilience on food consumption and expenditure. These outcomes remain robust across various model specifications. The results presented in Table 4 indicate that the model under consideration exhibits a significant likelihood ratio Chi-square of 1200.82 at the 1% significance level. The first chi-square compares the model against the saturated test, while the second chi-square compares the baseline versus the saturated model. The saturated model demonstrates a perfect fit for the covariance structure. According to Browne et al., the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) indicates an adequate fit with values between 0.05 and 0.08 [143]. A value close to one on both the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) and the comparative fit index (CFI) denotes a good fit, as suggested by Hair et al. and Bentler [102,144]. The coefficient of determination (CD = 1.00) also confirms a perfect fit. Typically, for an adequate fit, the standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) should be less than 0.05, as recommended by Hu and Bentler [145]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.t004 Our study results demonstrate that access to basic services, land assets, and farm equipment significantly enhances household resilience. The positive impact of these factors on RCI suggests promising avenues for further research. Future studies could delve into how these components bolster agricultural system resilience, aiding government efforts in designing effective action plans. Exploring potential interactions among these factors could yield insights into the intricate dynamics of resilience. Interestingly, adaptive capacity showed no noticeable impact on RCI, highlighting the distinction between adaptation and resilience. Although our study indicates that livestock has a negative impact on resilience, it remains an invaluable resource for food security, income generation, and financial stability in rural economies. Livestock plays a crucial role in resilience management by acting as a liquid asset during economic crises, enhancing agricultural output through soil fertility and draft power, and improving access to financing. Building resilience remains the most effective strategy to withstand shocks. In developing countries, policies and programs aimed at improving household resilience can significantly advance long-term food security. Humanitarian resilience initiatives should prioritize addressing rural populations` needs, as they face heightened exposure to food insecurity. Study results indicate that prioritising access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation in rural areas is crucial for fostering local and national resilience. Furthermore, enhancing incentives for land protection and promoting sustainable land management practices can enhance agricultural resilience. Policies supporting agricultural technology and equipment can also bolster resilience. Implementing social safety nets and encouraging farmers to diversify their revenue streams are effective strategies beyond human-centric protection measures. To enhance the sustainability of livestock assets, policymakers should focus on improving the affordability and accessibility of veterinary services and climate-resilient livestock management at the grassroots level. Subsidies on livestock medicine, feed, and improved breeds should also be provided to reduce maintenance costs. Strengthening adaptive capacity requires skill-based education, financial inclusion, and institutional support to foster entrepreneurship and human capital development, thereby creating more employment opportunities and improving infrastructure. Additionally, targeted awareness programs should encourage women’s participation in household and community decision-making, ensuring gender-inclusive resilience-building strategies. However, the data used in our analysis were not explicitly gathered for resilience measurement purposes, which may limit the depth and accuracy of our study. Using cross-sectional data limits the ability to capture dynamic changes in household resilience over time, as it provides only a snapshot rather than reflecting long-term trends. Thereby restricts our ability to draw definitive conclusions about long-term resilience to food insecurity. It is important to acknowledge that, while this study emphasizes the role of land access and basic services in strengthening household resilience, social capital, gender dynamics, and power disparities are also significant, though less visible, factors influencing resilience in rural Bangladesh. These factors could not be explicitly incorporated into the SEM analysis due to dataset constraints. Furthermore, the absence of data related to recent shocks, disasters, or conflicts in our analysis limits the comprehensiveness of our study. These data constraints hinder our ability to examine the impact of acute events on household resilience, potentially overlooking critical dimensions of resilience dynamics. Future research should utilize longitudinal datasets specifically designed for resilience measurement, incorporating multiple survey rounds to capture temporal dynamics. Additionally, integrating socio-institutional variables with real-time data on shocks, disasters, and conflicts will enhance the comprehensiveness of resilience analysis, enabling a more accurate assessment of household responses to food insecurity.

Title: Exclusive: The CEO Who Wants to Make Her Bank the U.S. Gateway to Central Asia

Washington, D.C. –When Umut Abakirova graduated from the American University of Central Asia, she began her career as a loan officer. Two decades later, she is one of Central Asia’s most prominent women in finance: chief executive of Bakai Bank, one of the Kyrgyz Republic’s largest private lenders. Her ambition is to turn Bakai into a gateway between Central Asia and the West, a partner for American companies and investors seeking exposure to an overlooked but resource-rich region. In an interview with Breitbart News, Abakirova made her case for why Washington should pay attention. “We came here to represent our country, a little but very strong country, I would say, Kyrgyzstan,” she said. “We are growing very fast. And we are ready to be transparent and open for international cooperation.” Bakai has expanded rapidly. It serves more than a million clients, doubled its loan portfolio in the past two years, and counts Coca-Cola, KFC, Hyatt Regency, and General Electric among its corporate customers. In 2025 it became an official partner of UFC CIS, boosting its brand visibility far beyond finance. A Fitch Ratings report in June assigned Bakai a “B-” rating with a stable outlook, praising its profitability, deposit growth, and adequate capital buffers. The bank’s loan book grew at a 38 percent annual pace from 2022 through 2024, while deposits surged 64 percent. Abakirova described a problem little discussed outside the region: remittances from Kyrgyz workers in Russia, who make up roughly one-third of the country’s labor force. Western sanctions on Moscow have made official transfers nearly impossible. “Now this money is coming to our country by cash, or by crypto, or by Chinese yuan,” she said. “Honestly, we don’t like this growing influence of China.” She warned that sanctions are unintentionally strengthening Beijing’s hand in Central Asia. “We are afraid of secondary sanctions,” Abakirova said. “But we need some assurance from the government of USA or OFAC to make these transfers officially.” OFAC is the common abbreviation for the Office of Foreign Assets Control. It’s an office of the U.S. Department of the Treasury that administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries, regimes, groups, and individuals. The request, never before aired publicly, points to the delicate position of a small state wedged between Russia and China but seeking Western ties. The dependency runs deeper than remittances. “We have no choice besides buying gas from Russia,” she said, explaining how sanctions policies are inadvertently pushing her country toward alternatives Washington would prefer to avoid. “That’s why we have come here.” Despite its international outreach—audited by KPMG, deploying U.S.-made LexisNexis compliance systems, and publishing its first ESG report—Bakai still faces a basic barrier: no American bank has correspondent accounts in the Kyrgyz Republic, or even in Central Asia. “That is also a problem for our region,” Abakirova said. “We are very transparent. But we need those relationships to connect.” Her push is to persuade U.S. banks and regulators that Bakai is a credible counterparty—highlighting the bank’s Big Four audits, membership in Washington-based trade finance associations, and its designation as a systemically important bank at home. Kyrgyzstan’s Abakirova sits down for a face-to-face Interview with John Carney (Breitbart News) Kyrgyz itself has been expanding at a brisk clip, with 9 percent GDP growth annually from 2022 through 2024, the highest in Central Asia. The government is building more renewable energy capacity, expanding railways, and tapping deposits of gold, lithium, and rare earths critical to global supply chains. “We are more open. We are more democratic, in comparison with other countries, and we are more open for international institutions,” Abakirova said. Her pitch is that the country offers both strategic resources and political openness, making it a natural partner for the U.S. “We want to be a gateway to Central Asia for America,” Abakirova said, saying this could make the region less dependent on Russia and China. Abakirova’s personal trajectory mirrors her country’s ambitions. She rose from entry-level loan officer to CEO of Bakai after the bank acquired her employer. Now she oversees an institution with an 11 percent share of sector assets and a 12 percent share of deposits, growing fast but still looking for outside partners. Her meetings in Washington this summer with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and executives from BlackRock and Bank of America were a first step. Whether her calls for U.S. engagement are answered may determine if Bakai remains a domestic success—or becomes Central Asia’s bridge to the global financial system.

Title: The Great TikTok Sell-Off: Implications For US Consumers
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/anjanasusarla/2025/09/22/the-great-tiktok-sell-off-implications-for-us-consumers/
Time Published: 2025-09-22T12:21:41Z

ByAnjana Susarla, Contributor. Talks are ongoing between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on a potential TikTok deal. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that TikTok engineers will re-create a set of content-recommendation algorithms for the app in the US, using technology licensed from TikTok’s parent ByteDance. Such an arrangement could assuage concerns about national security. On April 24, 2024, the U.S. enacted the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which requires TikTok to be sold by its parent company, ByteDance, to non-Chinese owners or face a nationwide ban. The Supreme Court upheld the law in January 2025. Users on digital platforms face an overabundance of viewing choices. Unlike in the past where a consumer had to drive to a physical store and spend time browsing the limited inventory, now we have seemingly endless choices. Recommendation algorithms on various platforms, be it Netflix, TikTok, or YouTube — control how we navigate the choices made available by on-demand streaming media, since there is too much content for any one user to filter through. The digital overabundance of choices increases our dependence on algorithmic filters to curate and sort our entertainment preferences. This is where TikTok has an edge over its competitors. TikTok’s recommendation algorithm is hyper-personalized. The platform tracks incredibly detailed engagement patterns, such as video interactions (like, share, how long you watch a video), scrolling behavior (speed and pattern of navigation), your search history, the time spent on the app and your content creation patterns. TikTok also gathers very detailed location information, ranging from browsing habits and GPS location to interactions within apps, including precise GPS coordinates (if enabled), location inferred from IP address and time zone information. All this information is analyzed to personalize a "For You" page, predict what content consumers engage with, target advertisements and to identify trending content and creators. The sheer volume and granularity of this data collection allows TikTok to build incredibly detailed user profiles, enabling their highly addictive recommendation algorithm while raising significant privacy concerns about how this information is stored, processed, and potentially shared. A new ownership structure could allow American supervision of the algorithm. Traditional e-commerce platforms are goal oriented and assume customers know what they want and come to shop with a specific purpose. E-commerce platforms such as Amazon implicitly assume that users have a clear purchase intent, and success is measured by quickly users can find and buy what they need. TikTok on the other hand enables product discovery while users are watching entertaining videos, often impulse-buying items they weren’t searching for. The TikTok model treats shopping as entertainment and focuses on helping users discover things they didn't know they wanted. The platform suggests items based on trends, lifestyle, or visual appeal, where shopping becomes a leisure activity, not just a transaction. Products are discovered through influencer content, user reviews, and social features. This shift reflects changing consumer behavior, especially among younger demographics who prefer discovery and entertainment over traditional product research. It also allows platforms to introduce users to a much broader range of products than what consumers might have searched for on their own. Indeed, it is estimated that TikTok users in the U.S. have spent close to $41.3 million in the app to date, or about 55 percent of the global total, placing the US first in terms of user revenue for the app. Most users of digital platforms are completely in the dark about the extent to which platforms monetize user interactions, and in turn, how nudges and recommendations from platforms impact aggregate behavior. Social media companies primarily monetize through advertising, which relies heavily on user data to target ads effectively. Users’ personal information, behavioral patterns, and social connections are essentially the product being sold to advertisers. When users lack control over their data, they can’t make informed decisions about their digital footprint or protect sensitive information from being used in ways they didn’t anticipate. Such concentrated data ownership gives platforms significant influence over information flow, user behavior, and even democratic processes, as seen in lawmakers concerns about election interference and misinformation. Most major platforms now offer some data control options, largely due to regulations like Europe’s GDPR and California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), that allow for data portability, deletion rights, and enhanced privacy settings. Under such regulations, companies are also required to publish transparency reports disclosing what data they collect and how it’s used, though these are often lengthy and technical. Despite these controls, true data ownership remains elusive because terms of service often grant platforms broad rights to use consumer data. Data deletion doesn’t necessarily remove copies used for analytics or shared with third parties. The complexity of modern data processing makes it difficult to track all uses. The key requirement from US legislation is that ByteDance must divest its control, but the specific ownership structure of the replacement entity remains flexible. It is worth noting that ByteDance’s ownership is already diversified, with 60% owned by global institutional investors such as BlackRock, General Atlantic, and Susquehanna International Group. As AI-powered search becomes more sophisticated, it could pull users away from TikTok’s discovery-driven model. While the younger generation prefers TikTok to typing queries on Google, AI assistants could reclaim this behavior by providing more personalized, conversational answers. AI also threatens TikTok's creator economy by potentially flooding the platform with synthetic content. TikTok’s core strength is its recommendation algorithm, but AI advancements could level this playing field through better personalization and cross-platform AI. New AI models can analyze user behavior across multiple platforms for superior targeting. AI could also enable entirely new types of social platforms and social interaction, such as the ability to personalize content to end users rather than just recommending existing content. Another way that AI could shape digital platforms is through enabling synthetic social experiences wherein virtual influencers and AI companions that provide entertainment without human creators. Finally, an era of integrated AI assistants could emerge where social media, search, and AI assistance converge into one experience. While the final details of the TikTok deal are being ironed out, it is worth pointing out that AI could erode TikTok’s key strengths in content creation and personalization. Here, again, though, TikTok could also have an edge in that its AI models are equipped with detailed behavioral data gathered from its users. Data could yet be the new currency in the new AI-enabled landscape.

Title: Forbes Daily: The Trump Family’s White House Windfall

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. For fans of the Savannah Bananas, it’s about more than just baseball. In a more fast-paced version of the sport known as Banana Ball, players backflip as they catch fly balls, take choreographed dance breaks between batters and more. The Bananas have sold out all 115 games on their 2025 schedule, and are even more popular online, with a larger social audience than any MLB franchise. The unusual approach is paying off: Forbes estimates that the four-team Banana Ball organization will post more than $100 million in revenue this year, and that the Bananas are worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 million. That’s about half as much as MLB’s least valuable team, the Miami Marlins. President Donald Trump issued a proclamation Friday that would impose an annual $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, which are used by companies to hire skilled workers from abroad. It’s a dramatic increase over existing program fees, which include $215 to register for the lottery and $780 for the petition. MORE: Shares of major Indian tech services firms plunged sharply on Monday in response, and U.S. tech giants Google, Meta and Microsoft, which are among the biggest sponsors of H-1B visas for foreign workers, were also down in premarket trading. Around 73% of all H-1B workers whose applications were approved in the fiscal year 2023 were Indian born, the Pew Research Center reported, while China ranked a distant second with 12% approvals. The decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show put a spotlight on Nexstar Media, the largest TV station owner and operator in the U.S., and its founder Perry Sook, who has largely stayed out of the spotlight over nearly four decades as chairman. Sook, who was compensated roughly $35 million as Nexstar’s chief executive in 2024, told investors in an earnings call shortly after Election Day that he hoped a second Trump Administration would help the firm expand further. President Donald Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping approved the deal that would keep TikTok online in the U.S., and the White House said on Saturday the deal would be signed “in the coming days.” Six of the seven board seats for TikTok’s U.S. entity will be occupied by Americans, who will also oversee the platform’s algorithm, and Oracle, the cloud computing firm headed by billionaire Larry Ellison, will lead TikTok’s “data and privacy.” Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI is expected to raise $10 billion in a funding round that would give the company a $200 billion valuation, CNBC reported. That would make xAI worth more than competitor Anthropic’s $183 billion, but less than ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is eyeing a secondary share selloff that could value it at $500 billion. Private equity firm Veritas Capital counts on government spending for the majority of its portfolio companies’ revenue, and CEO Ramzi Musallam remains confident about its growth despite cuts from the Trump Administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. Veritas closed its ninth flagship fund at $14.4 billion earlier this month, and Musallam says the firm is focused on companies with “must-have” technology that reduces wasteful spending. No U.S. president, or extended family, has used the office to profit as successfully as the Trumps. With crypto as the big driver, the family (including the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner) is now worth an estimated $10 billion, having nearly doubled their net worth since last year’s election. As a cofounder of 3BRAND, New York Giants quarterback Russell Wilson has quietly built a children’s sportswear company that surpassed $100 million in sales in 2024, despite headwinds in the retail market. It’s one of many business endeavors for Wilson, who tied for No. 49 on Forbes’ 2025 list of the world’s highest-paid athletes. Hundreds of airports may no longer require you to remove liquids from bags during security screenings, but it’s too soon for the policy to officially change nationwide, aviation security experts say. The latest X-ray technology can create three-dimensional images of passengers’ carry-on bags, but it could take at least a decade before all U.S. airports have the newer scanners. GPUs (graphics processing units), commonly designed by chip giant Nvidia, have become a crucial engine for artificial intelligence. Access to them can determine a company’s fortunes, and CoreWeave, which trades on the Nasdaq, has built a $50 billion (market cap) business by becoming one of their go-to brokers. After pioneering a new kind of financing that helped CoreWeave borrow $29 billion, CEO Michael Intrator now balances shareholders’ qualms about deepening debt and widespread fears about an AI bubble with his broader ambition: to provide compute not just to the tech giants but to every company integrating AI into its operations. In less than a decade, the business has spun up a data center empire, booking $1.9 billion in revenue in 2024 (net losses: $860 million, for a negative 45% margin) and $2.2 billion in the first half of 2025 (net losses: $605 million, or –28%). Its stock price has more than doubled since its March IPO, trouncing the broader Nasdaq’s return of 23.9% and minting at least five billionaires in the process. Intrator is now worth $6.7 billion, landing him on The Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans for the first time, along with cofounder Brian Venturo. The company’s remarkable growth has stemmed from ferocious global demand for GPUs. The AI cloud computing market was $230 billion in 2024 and, assuming the boom continues, is poised to explode to $400 billion by 2028, according to Wall Street analysts. “I’ve never seen a supply/demand imbalance like this in the 40 years I’ve been investing,” says Mark Klein, CEO of SuRo Capital, which invested a total of $25 million in CoreWeave. WHY IT MATTERS “CoreWeave has catapulted into prominence as one of the leading AI cloud compute providers with marquee customers like OpenAI, Microsoft and Meta,” says Forbes staff writer Rashi Shrivastava. “Shedding its crypto past and betting big on the value of Nvidia’s coveted GPUs, Michael Intrator took his company to a $50 billion valuation. But he relied (heavily) on debt, backed by those very GPUs that are depreciating a lot faster today. With billions on the line and concerns of an AI bubble, the stakes are far greater than ever before.” MORE This AI Cloud Provider Just Minted Four New Billionaires Workplaces often run on ambition—but many overachievers burn themselves out as a result of never feeling like they’re allowed to take a break. It’s critical to normalize taking strategic pauses for reflection after major sprints, and don’t just reward those who keep up the highest output for the longest. Ambition can be energizing and fulfilling if pursued sustainably. A federal judge threw out President Donald Trump’s $15 billion lawsuit against the New York Times on Friday. What was the reason? A.

Title: Asset-lite, profit-heavy: How Porter built India’s biggest intra-city logistics empire

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai/New Delhi: Azim Qureshi’s story is hardly unique. It is the story of millions of people who run small and mid-sized businesses across India. Qureshi, 54, runs a kirana store in Delhi, an operation that requires moving his stock on time everyday, across multiple tranches. Until a few years ago, he relied on a chaotic network of local fleet operators, with varying degrees of success and frustration. “Sometimes they showed up, sometimes they didn’t. Halfway through a delivery, they’d call saying the vehicle broke down, or suddenly, hike the price," he said. One day, help arrived on a smartphone, brought to him by his 24-year-old son. He introduced the senior Qureshi to Porter, a company now known for intra-city logistics—essentially the short-haul movement of goods within city limits. “My son books goods on the Porter app, for supplies from the mandi to my shop, and sometimes even from my shop to customers," the kirana owner said. “It can still be chaotic, but most of the time, it works." Then there is Anil Sharma, co-founder of Newtreo, a food and beverage brand with yearly sales of ₹16 crore a year. For a long time, he found himself trapped in a frustrating cycle of two-day lead times to deliver his ready-to-eat products—energy drinks, non-alcoholic beer, fruit juices among others—to customers. Using Porter brought that lead time down to two hours. “We end up using Porter at least three-four times everyday. We don’t mind paying a higher cost…when compared to a local player, there is also far more transparency in pricing," Sharma said, adding that at times, unorganised transporters hike price by as much as two-fold without any explanation. Newtreo also uses Delhivery, a larger logistics company, for bigger consignments across different cities. “While Porter is really good for intra-city and smaller shipments, Delhivery is more apt for larger orders," Sharma said. In 2014, Uttam Digga, Pranav Goel and Vikas Choudhary, the three founders of Porter, saw the chaos, mistrust, and inefficiency Qureshi and Sharma described. They set out to organize logistics for small businesses by aggregating mini-trucks, inspired by Uber’s ride-hailing model. The intra-city logistics market has always been a tough nut to crack. Orders are small, margins thin, and fuel costs unforgiving. Not to mention the stiff competition from a web of informal fleet operators. But Porter’s bet on an asset-lite model that caters to small businesses eventually paid off—the company was able to turn what looked like a messy, fragmented market into a system that could generate predictability, revenue, and profit. In 2024-25, the company’s revenue surged nearly 57% to ₹4,342 crore; it posted its first ever profit of ₹55 crore, from a loss of ₹96 crore a year earlier. India’s intra-city parcel delivery market, in 2024-25, was estimated at $600–800 million by Redseer, a research firm. Porter leads the pack, well ahead of Rapido, Borzo, Uber, Uncle Delivery and others, with commissions typically at 14–16%, said Mrigank Gutgutia, partner at the firm. That is not all. The company’s good run includes one of the largest fund raises this year— $200 million—from prominent investors including Kedaara Capital and Wellington Management. The round, which pegged the company’s valuation at around $1.2 billion, is yet to close. The capital raise is likely to touch $300 million, with new investors expected to join the cap table, multiple people familiar with the matter told Mint. We spoke to nearly a dozen stakeholders, including lawyers, consultants, logistics experts, investors and founder Pranav Goel to understand how the company cracked this difficult market. Their accounts reveal a story of sharp pivots, structural headwinds, and a high stakes balancing act between growth and profitability. That act would continue to shape the company’s trajectory, going ahead. The unlikely gamblePorter was not always in the business of short-haul logistics. Like we mentioned earlier, the Bengaluru-based company began as a mini-truck aggregation service, first, by catering to deliveries within cities and then foraying into inter-city operations. “While we were new to intra-city, we were ambitious," said founder Goel. “We thought we should also solve for inter-city and larger enterprises within the first year of business. We started multiple businesses which were very different from each other." View Full Image Porter began as a mini-truck aggregation service. Doing too many things too early proved costly. Inter-city and intra-city logistics run on different mechanics. In the first business, operators work with larger shipments, higher margins and the luxury of planning routes a day in advance. Intra-city, on the other hand, is about immediacy—customers expect a vehicle in 5–15 minutes—often for an order worth barely ₹500. Margins are razor-thin, and efficiency depends on real-time allocation. At the peak of India’s e-commerce boom, Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal were pumping volumes and capital into logistics. Soon, the inter-city segment overheated. Inefficiencies and cash burn made the model unsustainable, quickly cooling investor enthusiasm. Porter, competing with deep-pocketed rivals such as Mahindra’s SmartShift, was burning way too much capital. The founders pulled back. “The company chose to tighten their belt and took some hard calls to dramatically bring down costs—they shut the inter-city vertical and remained laser focused on their core area," Sasha Mirchandani, founder and managing partner at Kae Capital, the earliest investor in Porter, said. The startup, next, figured out a sweet spot. “The primary issue was severe underutilization. A vehicle, which could do four-five trips a day, was only doing a single trip back then. So, there was a big matchmaking problem between truckers and businesses," Goel recalled. There was a big matchmaking problem between truckers and businesses. — Pranav Goel Inefficiencies ran the deepest when it came to small businesses. “They deliberately focused on small and medium businesses while competitors chased larger enterprise accounts or individual customers," an industry executive said, asking not to be named. “They have built their model on sheer density." Porter’s ‘density model’ essentially refers to better asset/fleet utilization by providing the right vehicle at the right price, through faster order matching using its tech platform. The right vehicle could be a bike for a parcel delivery, and small trucks, or even three-wheelers, for heavier loads. Goel recalled that his team spent months largely on the streets, visiting wholesale markets and interacting with small business clusters. “We would explain how their transportation needs could be done through us. We helped them understand how we could be more reliable; help in bringing down their logistics cost," he said. “We replicated the same process with truck drivers and vehicle operators, assuring them of better vehicle utilization." Porter’s ‘density model’ refers to better asset/fleet utilization by providing the right vehicle at the right price, through faster order matching using its tech platform. Those early efforts worked. Porter says it now works with about two million small and medium businesses every month. An investor Mint spoke to, who didn’t want to be identified, said that Porter’s near-monopoly in intra-city logistics is built on sticky small and medium enterprise clients, loyal truckers, and an asset-lite model. “Supply and demand have become fairly concentrated for them. As the marketplace matured, the unit economics also began to show positively," the person said. The 2018 momentA pivotal moment came in February 2018. The Mahindra Group was scouting for opportunities to invest in the shared mobility sector. It zeroed in on Porter—at that time, it had over 10,000 vehicles on its platform and had executed 15,00,000 deliveries in the previous three years, according to a press statement. Mahindra announced that SmartShift, its on-demand logistics service, would merge with Porter. The auto-to-software conglomerate also invested ₹65 crore in the two entities. More than cash, the deal gave the young startup both validation and muscle in a still-fragile market. It unlocked Mahindra’s fleet, a wider customer base, and hard lessons from the ground. “Logistics is different and complex in every country and being backed by the Mahindra gave them a stronger understanding of the arena. A pure-play financial investor wouldn’t have been able to provide that," said a person involved in the transaction who didn’t want to be identified. Mahindra, according to data from Tracxn, went on to increase its bets on Porter in subsequent years. Since that deal, Porter’s investor roster also expanded to include Tiger Global Management, Vitruvian Partners and Elev8 Venture Partners. The reshuffleBy mid-2023, Porter felt confident enough to revisit inter-city logistics again, with a courier service offering door-to-door delivery. The company took on rivals such as Delhivery and Ekart head-on. In 2023, Porter also reshuffled leadership. Uttam Digga became CEO while Goel moved to an executive vice chairman role. Some market watchers said the move reflected the need for sharper execution, as the company was preparing for bigger strategic bets. “Uttam’s strategy and competency in driving growth, taking risk and operational rigour is unmatched," Goel said, adding that the transition was based on the company’s ambitions and target for the next decade. In 2023, Porter reshuffled its leadership. Uttam Digga became CEO while Goel moved to an executive vice chairman role. Some market watchers said the move reflected the need for sharper execution, as the company was preparing for bigger strategic bets. The transition also coincided with the company taking its foot off the growth accelerator to focus on profitability. Between 2020-21 and 2022-23, losses nearly tripled to ₹175 crore even as revenue grew over fivefold to ₹1,789 crore, according to data from Tracxn. Investors saw the red ink not as weakness, but intent. “The period of widening losses was a function of increased competitive intensity post the pandemic. Porter wanted to focus on growth and ride the online boom. Once they were comfortable with their top line, they made an internal call to bring down losses," said another investor, requesting anonymity. The logistics industry, overall, has also seen a reset— companies such as Delhivery, Rapido, Shadowfax and Shiprocket have turned profitable or have cut losses. This is largely a function of investors backing firms that can rein in burn, Mrigank Gutgutia of Redseer noted. Apart from inter-city logistics, Porter is now planting the seeds for further diversification. It is building out newer revenue streams like packers and movers services (which contributes to 5% of overall revenue), among others. In parallel, the company wants to expand beyond India—it has already started operating in the Middle East and other countries in the Indian subcontinent. A GST squeeze?Despite its successes, Porter faces a fresh challenge: The new goods and services tax (GST) regime. Earlier this month, the Indian government announced rationalisation of indirect taxes, with most products and services falling into two slabs—5% and 18%. But this has created ambiguity for Porter, as its services could be taxed at 18%, up from 5% earlier. View Full Image Traditional road transporters fall under the 5% GST bracket. The GST Council has brought local delivery services via e-commerce operators under the 18% slab, with platforms liable to pay tax under reverse charge if delivery partners are unregistered, explained Ankit Jain, partner at Ved Jain and Associates, a law firm.“This applies to standalone delivery apps like Porter, Uber Delivery or Rapido’s courier services, not to goods platforms such as Amazon or Flipkart where delivery is incidental to the sale of goods," Jain added. Meanwhile, the biggest cost for logistics firms, fuel, is kept outside the GST net. So, logistics firms can’t claim credit on it. This could create a cascading tax burden that inflates last-mile logistics costs. “Every rupee spent on fuel is a sunk cost, pushing up operating expenses," said Kulraj Ashpnani, partner at Dhruva Advisors, a tax advisory firm. However, Porter argues it is a ‘digital Goods Transport Agency (GTA),’ while an offline GTA is simply a traditional road transporter that issues a consignment note and falls under the 5% GST bracket. “We classify ourselves as a digital GTA. The new GST rule seems to be for delivery services meant for convenience of end consumers, unlike Porter, which serves the core goods transportation need for MSMEs," Goel said. “From a first-principles perspective, I don’t think the government’s intent is to tax digital GTAs differently from traditional offline GTAs—that would create a major disparity. A high digital tax would push MSMEs back to offline channels, which may not be the intent," he added. Nevertheless, ‘Digital GTA’ isn’t a formal GST category—it’s an industry shorthand for tech-led platforms. Goel added that the company is evaluating the impact on its business and hoped that the government will come up with clarifications soon. “Much of this extra tax will either get baked into what the customer pays or chip away at what the delivery partner earns," said Satish Meena, co-founder of Datum Intelligence, a research firm. “Platforms themselves can’t really absorb it right now—they’re chasing profitability while pouring capital into growth and new bets." Porter, which has navigated many tricky scenarios in the past, and built its unicorn business on the promise of bringing order to mess, now has a new chaos to cut through. Key Takeaways India’s intra-city parcel delivery market was estimated at $600–800 million in FY25 by Redseer. Porter is currently the leader of the pack, ahead of Rapido, Borzo, and Uber. The startup focused on small businesses while rivals chased larger enterprise accounts. Its ‘density model’—better asset utilization by providing the right vehicle at the right price—has worked. In 2024-25, the company posted its first ever profit. Porter is now planting the seeds for further diversification—inter-city, packers and movers services etc. It faces a fresh challenge—the new goods and services tax regime. Under GST 2.0, its services could be taxed at 18%, up from 5% earlier. Porter was not always in the business of short-haul logistics. Like we mentioned earlier, the Bengaluru-based company began as a mini-truck aggregation service, first, by catering to deliveries within cities and then foraying into inter-city operations. “While we were new to intra-city, we were ambitious," said founder Goel. “We thought we should also solve for inter-city and larger enterprises within the first year of business. We started multiple businesses which were very different from each other." Doing too many things too early proved costly. Inter-city and intra-city logistics run on different mechanics. In the first business, operators work with larger shipments, higher margins and the luxury of planning routes a day in advance. Intra-city, on the other hand, is about immediacy—customers expect a vehicle in 5–15 minutes—often for an order worth barely ₹500. Margins are razor-thin, and efficiency depends on real-time allocation. At the peak of India’s e-commerce boom, Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal were pumping volumes and capital into logistics. Soon, the inter-city segment overheated. Inefficiencies and cash burn made the model unsustainable, quickly cooling investor enthusiasm. Porter, competing with deep-pocketed rivals such as Mahindra’s SmartShift, was burning way too much capital. The founders pulled back. “The company chose to tighten their belt and took some hard calls to dramatically bring down costs—they shut the inter-city vertical and remained laser focused on their core area," Sasha Mirchandani, founder and managing partner at Kae Capital, the earliest investor in Porter, said. The startup, next, figured out a sweet spot. “The primary issue was severe underutilization. A vehicle, which could do four-five trips a day, was only doing a single trip back then. So, there was a big matchmaking problem between truckers and businesses," Goel recalled. Inefficiencies ran the deepest when it came to small businesses. “They deliberately focused on small and medium businesses while competitors chased larger enterprise accounts or individual customers," an industry executive said, asking not to be named. “They have built their model on sheer density." Porter’s ‘density model’ essentially refers to better asset/fleet utilization by providing the right vehicle at the right price, through faster order matching using its tech platform. The right vehicle could be a bike for a parcel delivery, and small trucks, or even three-wheelers, for heavier loads. Goel recalled that his team spent months largely on the streets, visiting wholesale markets and interacting with small business clusters. “We would explain how their transportation needs could be done through us. We helped them understand how we could be more reliable; help in bringing down their logistics cost," he said. “We replicated the same process with truck drivers and vehicle operators, assuring them of better vehicle utilization." Those early efforts worked. Porter says it now works with about two million small and medium businesses every month. An investor Mint spoke to, who didn’t want to be identified, said that Porter’s near-monopoly in intra-city logistics is built on sticky small and medium enterprise clients, loyal truckers, and an asset-lite model. “Supply and demand have become fairly concentrated for them. As the marketplace matured, the unit economics also began to show positively," the person said. The 2018 momentA pivotal moment came in February 2018. The Mahindra Group was scouting for opportunities to invest in the shared mobility sector. It zeroed in on Porter—at that time, it had over 10,000 vehicles on its platform and had executed 15,00,000 deliveries in the previous three years, according to a press statement. Mahindra announced that SmartShift, its on-demand logistics service, would merge with Porter. The auto-to-software conglomerate also invested ₹65 crore in the two entities. More than cash, the deal gave the young startup both validation and muscle in a still-fragile market. It unlocked Mahindra’s fleet, a wider customer base, and hard lessons from the ground. “Logistics is different and complex in every country and being backed by the Mahindra gave them a stronger understanding of the arena. A pure-play financial investor wouldn’t have been able to provide that," said a person involved in the transaction who didn’t want to be identified. Mahindra, according to data from Tracxn, went on to increase its bets on Porter in subsequent years. Since that deal, Porter’s investor roster also expanded to include Tiger Global Management, Vitruvian Partners and Elev8 Venture Partners. The reshuffleBy mid-2023, Porter felt confident enough to revisit inter-city logistics again, with a courier service offering door-to-door delivery. The company took on rivals such as Delhivery and Ekart head-on. In 2023, Porter also reshuffled leadership. Uttam Digga became CEO while Goel moved to an executive vice chairman role. Some market watchers said the move reflected the need for sharper execution, as the company was preparing for bigger strategic bets. “Uttam’s strategy and competency in driving growth, taking risk and operational rigour is unmatched," Goel said, adding that the transition was based on the company’s ambitions and target for the next decade. In 2023, Porter reshuffled its leadership. Uttam Digga became CEO while Goel moved to an executive vice chairman role. Some market watchers said the move reflected the need for sharper execution, as the company was preparing for bigger strategic bets. The transition also coincided with the company taking its foot off the growth accelerator to focus on profitability. Between 2020-21 and 2022-23, losses nearly tripled to ₹175 crore even as revenue grew over fivefold to ₹1,789 crore, according to data from Tracxn. Investors saw the red ink not as weakness, but intent. “The period of widening losses was a function of increased competitive intensity post the pandemic. Porter wanted to focus on growth and ride the online boom. Once they were comfortable with their top line, they made an internal call to bring down losses," said another investor, requesting anonymity. The logistics industry, overall, has also seen a reset— companies such as Delhivery, Rapido, Shadowfax and Shiprocket have turned profitable or have cut losses. This is largely a function of investors backing firms that can rein in burn, Mrigank Gutgutia of Redseer noted. Apart from inter-city logistics, Porter is now planting the seeds for further diversification. It is building out newer revenue streams like packers and movers services (which contributes to 5% of overall revenue), among others. In parallel, the company wants to expand beyond India—it has already started operating in the Middle East and other countries in the Indian subcontinent. A GST squeeze?Despite its successes, Porter faces a fresh challenge: The new goods and services tax (GST) regime. Earlier this month, the Indian government announced rationalisation of indirect taxes, with most products and services falling into two slabs—5% and 18%. But this has created ambiguity for Porter, as its services could be taxed at 18%, up from 5% earlier. View Full Image Traditional road transporters fall under the 5% GST bracket. The GST Council has brought local delivery services via e-commerce operators under the 18% slab, with platforms liable to pay tax under reverse charge if delivery partners are unregistered, explained Ankit Jain, partner at Ved Jain and Associates, a law firm.“This applies to standalone delivery apps like Porter, Uber Delivery or Rapido’s courier services, not to goods platforms such as Amazon or Flipkart where delivery is incidental to the sale of goods," Jain added. Meanwhile, the biggest cost for logistics firms, fuel, is kept outside the GST net. So, logistics firms can’t claim credit on it. This could create a cascading tax burden that inflates last-mile logistics costs. “Every rupee spent on fuel is a sunk cost, pushing up operating expenses," said Kulraj Ashpnani, partner at Dhruva Advisors, a tax advisory firm. However, Porter argues it is a ‘digital Goods Transport Agency (GTA),’ while an offline GTA is simply a traditional road transporter that issues a consignment note and falls under the 5% GST bracket. “We classify ourselves as a digital GTA. The new GST rule seems to be for delivery services meant for convenience of end consumers, unlike Porter, which serves the core goods transportation need for MSMEs," Goel said. “From a first-principles perspective, I don’t think the government’s intent is to tax digital GTAs differently from traditional offline GTAs—that would create a major disparity. A high digital tax would push MSMEs back to offline channels, which may not be the intent," he added. Nevertheless, ‘Digital GTA’ isn’t a formal GST category—it’s an industry shorthand for tech-led platforms. Goel added that the company is evaluating the impact on its business and hoped that the government will come up with clarifications soon. “Much of this extra tax will either get baked into what the customer pays or chip away at what the delivery partner earns," said Satish Meena, co-founder of Datum Intelligence, a research firm. “Platforms themselves can’t really absorb it right now—they’re chasing profitability while pouring capital into growth and new bets."

Title: Google faces antitrust déjà vu as US seeks to break up digital advertising business

After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department’s attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire during a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department's attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising. The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue. Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a “remedy” trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions. Although the judge hasn't set a timetable for making that decision, it's unlikely to come down before the end of this year because additional legal briefs and courtroom arguments are expected to extend into November before Brinkema takes the matter under submission. No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can't be filed until the remedy is determined. The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive. If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology — a proposal that the company's lawyers warned would “invite disruption and damage” to consumers and the internet's ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years. Google believes it has already made enough changes to its “Ad Manager” system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling., The legal battle over Google's advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct. In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month. Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist — a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion — an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April. In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial. As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's “radical” proposals. The Justice Department is “fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed," Google's lawyers argued leading up to the trial. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Buy second-hand. And we are not just talking about rummaging through your local charity shop hoping to find the bargain of the century – although we are not knocking that either. In the world in which we live we have sites such as Vinted, Depop, Facebook Marketplace, eBay and many, many more. By shopping second hand – or vintage if you’d rather – you will be able to rejoice in the fact that you are very on-trend. US fashion resale was worth $15.6 billion in 2015 and is now worth $55.3 billion. Vinted is the number one retailer in France by sales volume. And we all know the French know a thing or two about style. If just 10 per cent of Irish consumers shifted a decent chunk of their spending to second-hand retailers, not only would they get some cool bargains, they would be sending a signal to fast fashion that change is necessary. If you are buying, try and buy from small, local businesses where possible. And there are many of them: Fresh Cuts in Dublin city centre; Slowstreet in Blackrock, Co Dublin; Ohh! By Gum in Clifden; Pure Clothing in Ballina; and YAWUW (you are what you wear) in Cork. If you are going to a swanky wedding or a ball in a castle or some such, rather than spending an absolute fortune on a frock you’ll wear once, why not consider renting one from the likes of Drobey, HappyDaysRental or The 105? And when you are shopping, try – in so far as it is possible – to prioritise quality over quantity and natural fibres (organic cotton, certified wool, linen) over synthetic (polyester, acrylic). When you are in shops or shopping online, look for sustainable fabric certifications such as GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard), OCS (Organic Content Standard), RWS (Responsible Wool Standard), and RCS (Recycled Claim Standard). It is not going to solve the problem but it might go some way to not making it worse. [ Use your clothes for nine months more and reduce their environmental footprint by up to 30%Opens in new window ] It is hard to do any serious research while standing on a shop floor with a pair of jeans in your hand, so do some before you shop using resources like Good On You. It is most illuminating and easy to use. And finally, borrow from second World War Britain and make do and mend.

ByEmil Sayegh, Contributor. President Donald Trump signed a sudden proclamation Friday that no one saw coming. It imposes a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa petitions for foreign nationals outside the United States. The one-time fee, which does not apply to existing visa holders or renewals, takes effect immediately. The proclamation, called “Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers,” also raises prevailing wage requirements and introduces a national interest exception that allows the Department of Homeland Security to waive the fee in certain cases. It’s set to last 12 months unless extended. This order represents one of the most dramatic changes to the H-1B visa system in decades. As with Trump’s tariffs announcement, the proclamation sparked a strong public response. For years companies have paid relatively modest filing fees to sponsor high-skill workers. Now, the cost of a single new petition rivals the salary of an entry-level engineer. The administration says the move is intended to protect U.S. workers, prevent wage suppression and ensure that foreign hires are limited to cases of clear national interest. Many said that the news came out of nowhere and warned that it could harm American innovation. John Trasvina, former general counsel to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that the initial confusion was damaging. “At first people thought existing H-1B holders would be turned away unless employers paid $100,000. Clarification came but the panic was real.” Indian IT industry body Nasscom also warned of ripple effects on U.S. competitiveness and global job markets, pointing out that many firms rely heavily on rotating skilled foreign labor into U.S. operations. While industry leaders focused on disruption and risk, the administration framed the move as a chance to redirect opportunities toward U.S. citizens and strengthen the domestic workforce. Microsoft had already announced more than 15,000 layoffs in 2025, including 6,000 in May and another 9,000 in July. Across the broader industry, more than 144,900 tech workers have been laid off in over 500 separate events this year, according to TrueUp. Meta, Google, Intel and Amazon all contributed heavily to those totals. While the CompTIA unemployment report shows tech unemployment at 2.8% compared to 4.3% for the overall U.S. labor force, those percentages mask the scale of disruption. Tens of thousands of highly skilled engineers and cybersecurity professionals remain on the sidelines. This sudden policy shifts the spotlight toward that available domestic workforce. Federal agencies have also been shrinking as part of efficiency drives tied to the Department of Government Efficiency. Government bodies like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security have already let go of highly trained cybersecurity staff. Many of those workers are cleared and trained yet now find themselves searching for new opportunities. This policy creates pressure and incentive to reabsorb those citizens into private sector cyber roles where they are badly needed. The fee represents a costly inconvenience for large technology companies, but many can absorb it. For startups and mid-sized firms, the burden may be crushing. Some may choose to relocate development offshore, an option that creates new risks. Innovation in AI, cloud and advanced data science could slow if fewer foreign graduates enter the U.S. market. Worse, cybersecurity work, such as Security Operating Centers, moved offshore is a dangerous recipe for the United States and businesses in general. Protecting critical infrastructure and government systems requires U.S. citizens working on U.S. soil. Moving those functions abroad undermines security and invites potential insider threats from hostile actors. Federal downsizing has already put thousands of cleared cyber professionals out of work. This creates both a problem and an opportunity. On one hand, budget cuts may have weakened agencies responsible for defending critical infrastructure. On the other, the sudden availability of highly trained citizens means private companies now have access to talent that can be integrated into private cyber operations. This policy directly channels employers toward that workforce, strengthening national security by ensuring that sensitive work is handled by Americans. The Trump administration views this move as a way to accomplish multiple goals. It forces companies to prioritize U.S. citizens and laid-off federal workers. It raises the cost of relying on foreign labor and discourages abuse of the H-1B system. It strengthens national security by ensuring that cyber roles are staffed by U.S. citizens on U.S. soil, where clearance processes are more reliable and insider threats are less likely. The policy also generates new revenue that can support reskilling programs, STEM education and veteran transition initiatives. Just as importantly, it aligns with broader efforts like the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification, which require defense contractors to meet strict security and compliance standards by Nov. 10, 2025. By prioritizing U.S. workers and cleared personnel, companies can more easily meet CMMC requirements while reducing risk across the defense industrial base. The risks are equally clear. If retraining programs and certification pathways are not expanded quickly, many open roles will remain unfilled. Startups and immigrant-founded companies could falter or shift overseas. America’s global reputation as the preferred destination for top technical talent could decline. There are also legal questions about whether the executive branch has the authority to impose such sweeping fees and how “national interest exceptions” will be applied. At the same time, the opportunity is real. Tens of thousands of unemployed U.S. tech and cyber professionals are available and ready. This policy could open doors for them to reenter the workforce at higher wages and with greater stability. Whether this becomes a national advantage or a national setback depends entirely on whether America invests quickly and decisively in training, placement and domestic talent pipelines. The $100,000 H-1B fee is one of the boldest shifts in high-skill immigration policy in decades. It came without warning and blindsided even the largest players in the industry. The winners will be companies that already rely on U.S. citizens and have strong domestic pipelines. The losers may be startups, global firms dependent on H-1B talent and foreign nationals who had hoped to contribute to the American economy. At its core, this is not just about fees. It is about how America balances innovation, economic growth and national security. The immediate shock and reaction mirror what we saw with tariffs in past years. Then, as now, markets and companies panicked but eventually adapted. The real measure will be whether the United States uses this disruption as a catalyst to train, hire and secure its own workforce, including veterans and employees laid off from governmental agencies, or whether it allows opportunity to slip away.

Title: CoreWeave’s $29 Billion Bet That Its Debt-Fueled AI Boom Won’t Go Bust
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2025/09/22/coreweaves-29-billion-bet-that-its-debt-fueled-ai-boom-wont-go-bust/
Time Published: 2025-09-22T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByRashi Shrivastava, Forbes Staff andPhoebe Liu, Forbes Staff. It was a sunny day in August 2017, and CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator was beginning to think he might actually set his Manhattan office tower on fire. Dozens of powerful Nvidia GPUs were plugged into every available outlet, churning through the convoluted math required to mine cryptocurrency, and they were throwing off a ton of heat. With the air conditioning turned off for the weekend, the sixth-floor Financial District office had turned into a 130-degree hotbox. “I flipped. This wasn’t really built for this,” Intrator says. “I was just like, ‘We’ve got to go. We’ve got to go.’ ” He and his cofounders, Brian Venturo and Brannin McBee, scrambled, frantically disconnecting servers that were almost too hot to touch and loading them into a pickup truck before heading to New Jersey, where a garage properly ventilated with a gigantic exhaust fan waited to cool them. Nearly a decade later, some things haven’t changed. Intrator is still running GPUs, but on an exponentially larger scale. Now he’s got some 250,000 of them warehoused across the 33 data centers that CoreWeave operates, renting out access to their number-crunching prowess to compute-hungry customers. Once popular for rendering graphics for video games and mining crypto, GPUs (graphics processing units), commonly designed by chip giant Nvidia, have become a crucial engine for artificial intelligence. Access to them can determine a company’s fortunes, and CoreWeave, which trades on the Nasdaq, has built a $50 billion (market cap) business by becoming one of their go-to brokers, serving the likes of Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta in the race for AI ascendency. There is still the risk of fire—at least in a monetary sense. After pioneering a new kind of financing that helped CoreWeave borrow $29 billion, largely in loans backed by its GPUs, Intrator now balances shareholders’ qualms about deepening debt and widespread fears about an AI bubble with his broader ambition: to provide compute not just to the tech giants but to every company integrating AI into its operations. It’s not an unreasonable goal. In less than a decade, the Livingston, New Jersey–based business has spun up a data center empire, booking $1.9 billion in revenue in 2024 (net losses: $860 million, for a negative 45% margin) and $2.2 billion in the first half of 2025 (net losses: $605 million, or –28%). By 2031, it hopes to bring in another $30 billion, mostly from contracts with A-list customers like IBM and Meta and a string of AI startups such as Cohere and Mistral. Its stock price has more than doubled since its March IPO, trouncing the broader Nasdaq’s return of 23.9% and minting at least five billionaires in the process. Intrator, 56, is now worth $6.7 billion, landing him on The Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans for the first time, along with cofounder Venturo, 40, who’s worth $4.2 billion. Cofounders McBee and Peter Salanki, as well as early investor Jack Cogen, are also new billionaires thanks to CoreWeave. The company’s remarkable growth has stemmed from ferocious global demand for GPUs. Startups have been strapped for those sophisticated chips since ChatGPT exploded in popularity in 2022, with even OpenAI in February delaying rolling out a major model upgrade because it ran out of chips to run it on. That means whoever has GPUs holds the keys to an enormous business opportunity: The AI cloud computing market was $230 billion in 2024 and, assuming the boom continues, is poised to explode to $400 billion by 2028, according to Wall Street analysts. “I’ve never seen a supply/demand imbalance like this in the 40 years I’ve been investing,” says Mark Klein, CEO of SuRo Capital, which invested a total of $25 million in CoreWeave. Thanks to good instincts, a substantial appetite for risk and a dash of luck, Intrator realized early that his crypto company’s GPU stockpile could be good for more than minting tokens. A strategic relationship with Nvidia helped with the rest, positioning CoreWeave as one of the predominant cloud providers for the AI era. At first Silicon Valley investors weren’t convinced that CoreWeave could hold its own against well-capitalized cloud titans like Amazon, Microsoft and Google, which remain both arch-competitors and, in some cases, important customers. “The overwhelming majority of [investors] thought we were insane,” Intrator says. Spurned by VCs, he turned to the debt markets, what he calls “East Coast money.” Top-tier private creditors like Blackstone and Magnetar financed the multibillion buildout of CoreWeave’s infrastructure so it could capitalize on AI’s insatiable appetite for compute. Debt financing also meant that Intrator and his cofounders held on to more precious equity; Intrator retains 13%, Venturo 7%. The scale is the key, Venturo says. “The capital intensity of this business is all that matters.” Critics are spooked by the $11.2 billion in debt on CoreWeave’s balance sheet. And with interest rates ranging from 7% to 15%, expenses remain high: The company spent more than $250 million paying interest on that debt last quarter on just $19 million in operating income. Plus about half of CoreWeave’s assets are GPUs, which are said to depreciate over six years—or less, now that Nvidia is upgrading its chips faster. D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria doesn’t mince words: “This is a value-destructive entity.” Naysayers also point out that 62% of CoreWeave’s $1.9 billion revenue in 2024 came from one extremely large customer: Microsoft. That dependence won’t last long, though: OpenAI has committed to spending a total of $15.9 billion on CoreWeave’s infrastructure over the next five years and received a $350 million stake in the company. CoreWeave recently inked a deal to supply computing power to Google, and IBM has been using CoreWeave’s GPU clusters as well. “Our researchers can focus on the AI and less on the infrastructure,” says IBM Cloud CTO Hillery Hunter. Then there’s the existential question: Is the AI boom actually a bubble? In the first half of 2025, investors plowed $104 billion into artificial intelligence startups at towering valuations, per PitchBook, betting that AI really will turn out to be as revolutionary as the internet or the automobile and upend entire industries. That hasn’t happened yet. Despite spending billions on generative AI, many businesses haven’t seen material returns on it. Most AI companies still haven’t turned a profit. Even Sam Altman, AI’s chief carnival barker, is warning that overexuberant investors could “get burned.” That’s especially worrisome for CoreWeave, given its precarious, highly leveraged position as the industry’s premier GPU provider. Put another way: If this bubble were to pop, CoreWeave’s business would rupture along with it. Intrator’s talent for creative number crunching first emerged when he was a commodities trader at Natsource, a New York–based carbon credit trading and greenhouse gas asset mana­ger. There, from 1998 through the Enron scandal to 2014, he learned how to turn pollution into a financial instrument—just as he would later do with GPUs. After his first venture, a natural gas hedge fund, failed, Intrator and his cofounders pivoted, forming Atlantic Crypto in 2017 to mine ether. “We founded the company on a credit card,” Intrator says. “It was like, ‘Okay, I’ll buy a couple GPUs. What the hell?’ ” When crypto experienced one of its periodic crashes in 2018, the cofounders bought thousands of GPUs from miners going out of business for pennies on the dollar and raked in an estimated $80 million in revenue from mining. “Ethereum kept them alive long enough for them to make the transition to AI,” says early investor Nic Carter. Given ether’s volatility, Intrator realized the more lucrative bet was not fickle cryptocurrency but the equipment used to mine it. Their servers could be configured for different use cases: rendering 3D images, animation or early AI efforts. In 2019, they swapped out their “crappy” mining GPUs with data center–grade chips on a dollar-for-dollar basis. “Looking back on it, it was genius,” Venturo says. Their first break into AI came through a collaboration with Eleuther AI, a Washington, D.C.–based research nonprofit, in late 2021. CoreWeave shelled out $2 million to buy a bunch of Nvidia’s A100 chips and built a cluster of 96 GPUs for the organization, which was training a powerful open-source large language model. It did what Eleuther wanted but was plagued by bugs, networking issues and storage problems. At one point the nonprofit’s employees had to use an external storage device to manually offload data to ensure the system wouldn’t crash. “That was the tuition to learn how to build the infrastructure,” Intrator says. It was also a path to some early customers. Through Eleuther, CoreWeave found Stability AI, the creator of a viral early AI text-to-image generator called Stable Diffusion. That’s when Venturo saw the first outlines of an enormous business opportunity. But CoreWeave would need to double down on Nvidia’s chips to seize it. It would be “the most important thing this company is ever going to do,” he says. To buy those GPUs, CoreWeave needed cash—a lot of it, and fast. In late 2022, Evanston, Illinois–based asset mana­ger Magnetar Capital invested $100 million, giving CoreWeave the ammunition to buy thousands of Nvidia H100 chips and provide computational power for AI at scale. It later co-led a $2.3 billion round, CoreWeave’s first GPU-backed loan. Intrator’s genius: convincing Magnetar to secure the funds using the very chips he was buying as collateral. “They laid the groundwork for debt financing in the GPU space,” says Darrick Horton, CEO of cloud computing rival TensorWave. It was an unprecedented and risky move, but when Chat­GPT took AI mainstream in November 2022, Intrator’s gamble paid off. In January 2023, CoreWeave signed a $300 million deal with early AI darling Inflection to build a 22,000-GPU AI cluster, one of the world’s largest at the time. “We went from having nothing sold to having everything sold five times over,” Venturo says. By December 2022, CoreWeave had bought so many GPUs from Nvidia that its leadership took notice. The cofounders got a call out of the blue; Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wanted to talk. Twenty minutes later, they were on a Zoom call with him, pitching the cofounder of the world’s largest semiconductor company on investing in a no-name former crypto miner. Huang saw in CoreWeave an opportunity to strengthen Nvidia’s dominance in the AI market by propping up a future buyer for its complex chips that had the technical expertise to run them efficiently, Intrator says. Nvidia invested some $350 million in CoreWeave for a 5% stake (now worth $2.5 billion) and granted it “elite” status on its partner network, vaulting it to the front of the line for the company’s most cutting-edge chips. (Nvidia declined to comment for this story.) It’s quite the incestuous relationship. (Intrator prefers “symbiotic.”) Nvidia is a vendor, an investor and a customer; it has paid CoreWeave at least $320 million for its infrastructure and agreed to buy its unsold capacity through 2032. But it is by no means a relationship of equals. In fiscal 2025 (ended January), Nvidia made $72.9 billion profit on $130.5 billion revenue. Its current market capitalization exceeds $4.3 trillion. D.A. Davidson analyst Luria puts it directly: “CoreWeave wouldn’t exist if Nvidia didn’t want it to.” As CoreWeave landed larger contracts, it took on more debt to fulfill them. In 2023, it struck a deal with Microsoft, which reportedly plans to spend $10 billion on its cloud computing services through 2030. That was enough for Blackstone to lead $2.3 billion in debt financing in 2023, followed by a fatter $7.5 billion check in 2024. “We are underwriting contracts, capacity and power, not a particular ‘story,’ ” says Jas Khaira, a senior managing director at Blackstone, adding that the due diligence process ensured the contracts were airtight and customers like Microsoft couldn’t easily walk away. Inside a coolly lit data center in Orangeburg, New York, about 40 minutes north of Midtown Manhattan, rows of what look like hospital IV bags hang across long banks of densely packed black shelves. Each bag dispenses a drip of neon-green cooling fluid to a rack of GPU-filled servers when needed, keeping them at the safe, always-on temperature at which they help pay for CoreWeave’s considerable investment in them. Just how much revenue those servers can deliver depends on two things: how long AI’s demand for compute will outstrip supply and how long it will take AI companies to catch up. Microsoft, for instance, spent $88 billion on capex in the year ending June 2025, most of which was for AI infrastructure. Open AI reportedly signed a $300 billion deal with Oracle recently to provide compute—part of its President Trump–endorsed Stargate partnership—calling into question the future of its contracts with CoreWeave. Aside from the hyperscaling incumbents, CoreWeave must also battle cloud computing rivals like Crusoe, Nebius and Lambda, many of which have landed contracts with CoreWeave’s big tech clients, who use multiple cloud providers to reduce dependence on just one. “Renewal and retention is a risk,” says Macquarie analyst Paul Golding. “We think about risk in a more sophisticated way than almost anyone else in the space.” And then there’s that debt. CoreWeave has no plans to stop borrowing against its GPUs—debt could rise to $30 billion in two years, per JPMorgan projections. Some analysts are worried about the risk of doing that, especially amid ongoing net losses ($2.1 billion in total since 2023) in a fast-moving industry. Intrator has heard and dismissed all this before. “No shit, I’m borrowing money,” he says, gesticulating defiantly at his Wall Street haters while en route to CoreWeave’s Manhattan office. McBee backs him up. “There’s no risk,” he says, improbably. They claim each CoreWeave contract (average length: four years) prices in most of the costs of delivering on it—GPUs, data center buildouts and interest payments—plus depreciation and maintenance. If all goes as planned, then, CoreWeave is left with some profit plus the value of its GPUs. Generally, contracts are structured to generate approximately $2 of revenue for every dollar of debt to be repaid, McBee says. The risk, of course, is that the AI boom goes bubble and pops—and those contracts are never fulfilled, leaving CoreWeave with a ton of idle servers and a mountain of debt. Citi analyst Tyler Radke forecasts CoreWeave could be profitable as early as next year. It’s losing money because of interest payments and because infrastructure costs a lot to build upfront. “We think about risk in a more sophisticated way than almost anyone else in the space,” Intrator says. Maybe. But many credit rating agencies categorize CoreWeave’s latest bonds as junk. Even if the boom times continue, things could go south fast if the company can’t build out what it has promised, as quickly as promised. Then there are the known unknowns: regulatory hurdles, manufacturing mishaps, local opposition. Protests alone have already stopped or slowed $64 billion in data center projects, according to Data Center Watch. And CoreWeave is already facing opposition over a new facility in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where it’s investing $6 billion. When it’s finished, it is expected to consume four times as much power as all the region’s homes, says Lancaster resident Emma Burgess. Residents of the community known for its Amish history recently packed city council meetings to voice their concerns: too little community input, too much electricity, too much pollution (both air and noise). McBee says there hasn’t been pushback at the site, but acknowledges “you’re gonna break things along the way.” Because CoreWeave’s AI data centers need to be on 24/7/365, they can’t be subject to the fluctuations that come with wind and solar power. So for the time being “it’s gas,” McBee says. “That’s what we prefer.” In May, CoreWeave acquired AI software developer Weights & Biases for $1 billion, a deal it hopes will diversify its customer base. A planned $9 billion acquisition of data center owner Core Scientific—which could bring some 1.5 gigawatts of additional contracted power—would more than quadruple CoreWeave’s current active power, provided regulators and shareholders allow it. Next up: investing in AI startups with a combo of cash and GPU access. Things are volatile. CoreWeave’s market cap has swung by some $70 billion since its rocky March IPO. Tariffs could further unsettle its bottom line. Its biggest customer just signed a huge deal with a rival fast encroaching on its turf. Delays, of both capital and equipment, could kill CoreWeave’s head start. None of this has fazed Intrator, who’s confident his GPU-backed debt will pay off and keep his company growing alongside rampant demand for AI compute. As the markets rise, so too will CoreWeave, buoyed by the prescient bets that made it a $50 billion behemoth in just six years. But it’s still beholden to the biggest gamble of all—that the AI bubble won’t burst. This story has been updated to clarify a statement about Microsoft’s projected capital expenditures.

Title: What’s Up with the Crazy Flow Volatility at ARK’s ETFs?

Time Published: 2025-09-22T10:10:00Z
Full Content:
Competing theories have been proposed to explain why billions of dollars have gone into and out of several ARK ETFs in recent weeks. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com Something strange has been happening to several of ARK’s ETFs recently: Assets have been spiking like blood sugar after a pumpkin spice latte. There has been speculation about the causes, but no one, other than the unidentified traders, knows why. One explanation is that the activity is merely heartbeat trades that were used to wash taxes. Another is that a zealous bunch of retail investors wanted exposure to a few IPOs. But the most interesting theory, from the Financial Times’ Robin Wigglesworth, is that someone gamed the creation and redemption process to ultimately pocket a cool $21 million in just a matter of days. Just before the Bullish IPO in August, someone could have borrowed shares of constituent stocks that are in the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and used the holdings to create about 70 million ETF shares, Wigglesworth wrote. After ARKK bought Bullish shares in the IPO, the person or group seemingly redeemed their ETF shares for the constituents, able to then sell the Bullish stock at a premium, he said. A twist is that the same thing appeared to have happened ahead of Klarna’s Sept. 10 IPO, “with one crucial, hilarious twist … ARKK didn’t actually invest in the Klarna IPO!” Wigglesworth noted. If the theory is correct, it would be an uncommon approach to profiting within ETFs, said Todd Sohn, senior ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities. Many ETFs don’t buy stocks at the time of an IPO, he said. “This activity is happening outside the fund in the primary market through the APs/market makers; they are bearing the cost of the activity.” Other ETF shareholders are insulated from the effects of such tactics, he said. Regardless of what’s happening, it’s interesting. “It’s an incredibly unique situation,” Morningstar principal US equity strategist Robby Greengold said. “Three of ARK’s ETFs have been swept up in these violent flow patterns that don’t really happen anywhere else. This is fascinating to watch unfold, but it’s also extremely difficult to know who’s behind it.” There is a potential downside for other investors in the ARK funds, as the ETFs significantly increased their cash allocations after the share creations. The flow activities showed dramatic changes: Low Point in the Arc: As of Friday, the data didn’t show a massive exit from ARKK, and what’s happening isn’t clear. ARK did not comment on any of the recent flow activity. “Effectively, it’s dilutive to any of ARK’s pre-existing fund holders,” Greengold said of the big fluctuations that hiked cash allocations. “That post-IPO pop wasn’t felt as strongly as it otherwise would have been.” Big, multinational firms have regional expertise and may be able to swallow the costs, but smaller companies will have a harder time. Investors in YieldMax ETFs may have lost about 11% per year since late 2022, according to a recent Morningstar report. ETF uptake varies significantly across generations. This gap presents a major growth opportunity for the industry. The Federal Reserve’s decision may not have been a surprise, but ripple effects are already being felt across the industry. Generic listing standards for crypto exchange-traded products could open the floodgates for ETPs beyond spot Bitcoin and Ethereum. The New York-based firm is planning to launch some of the first tokenized ETFs, according to a report. The company filled a hole in its fixed-income ETF line — but the timing may not be ideal, given relatively low yields in junk bonds relative to Treasurys, one observer said. Reckoner Capital Management, which added its Leveraged AAA CLO ETF in July, has aspirations of building out a global credit business. As new ETFs launch at breakneck speed, expensive products are raking in revenue. The firm’s founder claims a new ETF using fundamentals beyond market-cap weighting to determine holdings is the next big thing. Funds holding large financial institutions have significantly outperformed broad market indices this year. The exchange could start offering tokenization of securities, including exchange-traded products and stocks, next year. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Palantir Wants to Be a Lifestyle Brand
URL: https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-wants-to-be-a-lifestyle-brand/
Time Published: 2025-09-22T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Palantir Technologies, which moved from Silicon Valley to Denver in 2020, sells software that immigration authorities use to identify and arrest people, militaries use to organize drone strikes, and corporations use to manage their supply chains. Now, it also sells tote bags. Last year, Palantir relaunched an online merchandise store, and its website was recently redesigned with a swanky interface and new payment system. A mock terminal in the lower left corner displays “code” documenting each item you view. A page titled “Core Capsule” displays an assortment of sold out items, like athletic shorts with text reading "PLTR—TECH" running down the right butt cheek, which sold for $99. It also shows a puffy “ergonomic" nylon tote bag that was priced at $119, and a Palantir baseball cap that ran for $55. The site is relaunching on Thursday evening with a new merch drop. Many companies produce branded swag for their employees and clients, including the legacy defense contractors that Palantir is trying to disrupt. Lockheed Martin sells a skunk stuffed animal, a nod to its R&D team that started secret operations under the name “Skunk Works” during World War II. Boeing sells T-shirts and keychains depicting various military aircraft, like its B-52 bomber jets and AH-64 attack helicopters. They’re products that may appeal to current or former employees, or their friends and family. But what Palantir is doing feels far more ambitious: The company seemingly wants to be a lifestyle brand. Eliano Younes—the company's head of strategic engagement, who runs the merch store and posts about it frequently on X—has been explicit about this in multiple posts. “Palantir is THE lifestyle brand,” Younes posted on X in March. “The most pro-west, meritocratic, winning obsessed, and based brand on the face of the earth.” But what does it mean for Palantir—a company that, in the words of one former employee, essentially sells digital “filing cabinets” to customers like Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, Heineken beer, and General Mills—to be a lifestyle brand? Lifestyle brands sell products that people buy to express their identities, whether they’re Tesla super fans, Zyn bros, or Hydroflask water bottle girlies. These brands aren’t necessarily successful because they have a superior product, but rather because they’re skilled at “proposing an original point of view” and “influencing a social context,” argues the book Lifestyle Brands, cowritten by management professor Stefania Saviolo and brand consultant Antonio Marazza. Using the products they sell is a symbolic act, a way to “to signal status” or demonstrate “a sense of belonging to a group.” Generally, lifestyle brands are known for products they sell to the public. People recognize Tesla as a company that sells cars, and Zyn as a company that sells nicotine pouches. To state the obvious, Palantir is not a clothing company. And the software it does sell is not consumer-facing. Its price tag is so large that, often, giant government agencies and corporations are the only ones that can afford it. Palantir is not exactly an obvious candidate for a lifestyle brand. And yet, despite the odds, Palantir has a fan base that includes many potential merch customers. Palantir bros are not hard to encounter online: There are several Palantir-focused subreddits, the largest of which has 109,000 members. Some people on X have been able to amass huge followings by posting exclusively about the company throughout the day. Palantir fans can obsessively focus on the company’s stock price. They can behave like American football fans when it goes up, celebrating as if their team scored a touchdown. When it gets a big contract, it’s as if their team got a new star player. In this context, it makes sense that people would want to purchase merch—it’s like buying a jersey. Palantir’s fan base gradually expanded during the years that contractors for immigration enforcement and the military were least popular in Silicon Valley. For fans, Palantir was a contrarian dark horse that stood by its principles, even though others detested them. For Palantir, becoming a lifestyle brand seems more about getting the company’s fans to publicly identify with its brand and its mission. This is made explicit on a white note card, with CEO Alex Karp’s signature, that was included with recent orders of Palantir merch. “Thank you for your dedication to Palantir and our mission to defend the West,” the card reads. “The future belongs to those who believe and build. And we build to dominate.” Younes has expressed a similar sentiment. “Palantir isn't just a software company,” he wrote on X in August. “It’s a world view—western values, pro-warfighter, problem solving, conviction, dominant software, etc. that’s why people rep the gear.” These values have not always been popular in Silicon Valley. In fact, historically, they’ve been outright rejected. In 2018, thousands of Google workers rallied against the company’s involvement in Project Maven, a Pentagon project analyzing drone footage with AI. Conceding to the workers, Google chose to not renew its Maven contract but said it wouldn’t stop working with the Pentagon. That same year, protests against Palantir were popping up in Palo Alto in response to the company’s work with ICE. (ICE did not cancel any contracts.) However, under the second Trump administration, the tech world is beginning to openly embrace aligning with the military—both transactionally, and symbolically. In June, the Army commissioned an elite group of tech executives to be “lieutenant colonels.” Palantir chief technology officer Shyam Sankar was joined by Meta chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil, and current Thinking Machines Lab adviser and former OpenAI chief research officer Bob McGrew, who also worked at Palantir. Palantir’s current merch store appears to capitalize on this vibe change and communicate that the company is doubling down on its reputation, branding, and mission. In an April letter to shareholders, Karp wrote that its mission “was for years dismissed as politically fraught and ill-advised.” “We, the heretics, this motley band of characters, were cast out and nearly discarded by Silicon Valley,” Karp wrote. “And yet there are signs that some within the Valley have now turned a corner and begun following our lead.” One of Palantir’s first merch releases was a black shirt with a giant red graphic. The oblong shape resembles an oval projection of the earth. There are three lines inside the oval that evoke latitude-longitude lines, or a wireframe globe. In the direct center, there’s the Palantir logo. Symbolically, it looks like Palantir is controlling the world. Ironically, one of the most common misconceptions about Palantir is that it’s one giant database with information from every single one of its clients. The company has published several blogs trying to dispel this myth on a factual basis. This shirt, by contrast, appears to take a different approach. It symbolically mocks, embraces, and dismisses this misconception. It seemingly was created with precisely Karp’s “heretics” in mind. At the core of Palantir’s merch identity is its insistence that all of the products are “Made in the U.S.A.” Like many other companies, Palantir wants to evoke a sense of pride in supporting American workers. But it’s very expensive to produce clothes made in the United States—especially ones with custom tags and high-quality materials, as the company claims. Palantir’s head of strategic development has said that the goal of the merch store, financially, is to simply break even. When the website relaunched, Younes blamed tariffs for the higher cost of the merchandise. “This will not be a new revenue stream,” he posted in May 2024. Simply put, Palantir doesn't have to do this. In fact, Palantir has actually tried and failed to run a merch store before. Archives of the old store show a simple white website with nondescript T-shirts and hats. At the time, some customers complained that they were cheaply made and unattractive. Palantir shut it down in 2023. Palantir isn’t alone. The defense tech company Anduril, which is known for embracing working with US immigration authorities early in its history, launched a “gear store” shortly after Palantir relaunched its own. It sells shiny black flight jackets, Hawaiian shirts (not unlike the ones CEO Palmer Luckey is known to sport), and T-shirts that say “workatanduril.com” in black sans serif text overlain with “DON’T” scrawled in black graffiti, seemingly in an attempt to look rebellious and cheeky. Like Palantir, the company is eager to note when its products are “Made in the USA.” WIRED was unable to independently confirm details about the production of Palantir and Anduril merch, including whether it was made in America, or which manufacturers they used. Neither company responded to a request for comment on the topic. Garments made in the US are typically made by immigrants, which make up more than 40 percent of the workforce. Many of them are undocumented, and can be compensated by tasks completed rather than being paid by the hour, which overwhelmingly adds up to far below the minimum wage. Palantir has been doing a lot of work for ICE under Trump 2.0. Since April, it has been building “ImmigrationOS,” a new system for the agency to, ideally, have “near real-time visibility” on people self-deporting. (Public documents are not clear about how ImmigrationOS would do this, or what data it would use.) ICE is paying Palantir $30 million to do this. Palantir is scheduled to provide ICE with a prototype of ImmigrationOS on September 25. On September 18, it released new merch.

Title: Sudden $200 Billion Crypto Sell-Off Sparks Fresh Bitcoin Price Crash Fears

Full Content:
ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 09/22 update below. This post was originally published on September 20 Bitcoin and crypto have exploded back this year, largely thanks to BlackRock-led Wall Street adoption and U.S. president Donald Trump’s support (though fears have emerged of a bitcoin price “death spiral”). Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price topped $124,000 per bitcoin last month, though its early 2025 rally has stalled in recent months, just as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk issued a stark $37 trillion warning. Now, as Goldman Sachs quietly admits to growing fears over the U.S. dollar, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved a major rule change that could mean the bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) “floodgates” open. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run This week, the SEC voted in favor of proposed rule changes by three national securities exchanges, allowing them to adopt generic listing standards for new crypto ETFs. 09/22 update: The bitcoin price has fallen sharply, dropping around 3% in mere minutes and plunging under $112,000 per bitcoin from a peak of almost $118,000 just last week. "Bitcoin broke through support near $115,000, which bears had been tryingto push through since 13 September," Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro’s chief market analyst, said in emailed comments. “In recent days, there have been several signals of a shift to a downward trend in the first cryptocurrency. BTCUSD fell out of the upward channel that had been in place since early September, dropped below horizontal support and fell sharply below the 50-day moving average. This combination of negative signals suggests a further decline is likely unless there is a fundamental change in financial market sentiment.” Bitcoin’s sudden price dive has hit the wider crypto market, wiping $200 billion from the combined market since Friday. “Bitcoin is currently entering a correction phase,” Linh Tran, a market analyst with XS.com, said in emailed comments. “This pause is seen as necessary to absorb profit-taking pressure, reduce short-term leverage, and lay the groundwork for a more stable price base.” Last week, the Federal Reserve met expectations when it cut interest rates by 25 basis points, with a reduction of interest rates generally seen to be supportive of risk assets like bitcoin and crypto—though a a nightmare scenario could send bitcoin into a “death spiral." “This signaled the end of the tightening cycle, but Fed chair Jerome Powell’s cautious remarks that future policy would remain data-dependent tempered market expectations for the pace of easing," said Tran. "This explains why bitcoin stalled, even though a lower interest rate environment typically benefits risk assets.” The bitcoin price correction was expected following last week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, according to some analysts. “While the FOMC meeting sparked optimism for a Q4 breakout, bitcoin was more likely to enter a 1-2 week consolidation phase immediately afterward," Markus Thielen, the chief executive of 10x Research, said via email, pointing to a rise in leveraged longs that are increasingly vulnerable as liquidity thinned and raising the risk of a downside break. “On-chain metrics provide further evidence that market activity is once again fading,” Thielen added. "The real question: how long can this consolidation drag on?” The SEC approval "will open up the floodgates," Steve Feinour, a partner at Stradley Ronon, told Reuters. “The big trigger this week was the SEC’s approval of generic listing standards for crypto ETFs on the likes of NYSE, Nasdaq, and Cboe,” Nic Puckrin, macroeconomics analyst and founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. “Until now, every ETF had to go through a lengthy, case-by-case process. Now, new products can be listed in just 75 days. This is significant for funds tied to ethereum, solana and dogecoin, or even diversified crypto baskets, as it dramatically reduces the barriers.” Alongside the rule change and proving there is demand for crypto ETFs beyond bitcoin and ethereum, the first U.S. ETFs to offer spot exposure to Ripple’s XRP and dogecoin started trading on Thursday, generating about $55 million in trading volume. The REX-Osprey XRP ETF, listed on Cboe under the ticker XRPR, saw the largest debut volume of any ETF launch this year, according an X post by Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market In August, NovaDius Wealth president Nate Geraci said it makes “zero sense" for BlackRock to ignore cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin and ethereum. “Otherwise, they’re basically saying bitcoin and ethereum are only ones that will ever have value. Bold,” Geraci posted to X. BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF exploded onto Wall Street in early 2024, becoming the fastest growing ETF ever and now holds almost 750,000 bitcoin worth $88 billion on behalf of investors. BlackRock, which manages around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with its IBIT bitcoin fund dominating a fleet of funds that launched in January 2024. BlackRock’s fund alone holds almost 4% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network.

Title: Dogecoin Price Could Break Into Double-Digit Rally From This Fibonacci Level

The Dogecoin price has since retraced after its run to $0.3 as sell-offs had grown stronger over the last week. There is also the fact that the Fed had cut interest rates by a quarter of a point last week, but because it was already priced into the market, there was barely any reaction to it. As such, the Dogecoin price stalled and continued to follow the established downtrend. But as the meme coin ushers in a new week, there is the possibility of a recovery and even a rally from here. Crypto analyst MadWhale outlined some notable developments surrounding the Dogecoin price and what could trigger the next wave of price action. Besides the Fed rate cuts not doing anything for the crypto market, there is also the expectation of multiple altcoin ETFs that could trigger the next rally. Recently, excitement around a possible Dogecoin ETF going live for trading has been on the rise after experts had projected a possible acceptance by the SEC last week. The decision was ultimately postponed by the regulator, but this has done nothing to dampen the excitement. The REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) is still expected to go live sometime this month if the SEC gives its blessing, and the analyst explains that this could be what drives another rally. In fact, there have been expectations that the Dogecoin price could rise by up to 75%, and others have predicted that the price could double. In addition to the ETF excitement, the fact that Dogecoin whales are making their way back into the arena is exciting. With around $266 million worth of DOGE bought and withdrawn from exchanges, exchange liquidity has declined, pushing the supply down to help boost demand and trigger a possible price increase. Besides the bullish developments surrounding the Dogecoin price with the ETF filings and whale buying, there is also the technical side that points to bullishness. This is because the Dogecoin price is currently sitting close to a critical Fibonacci level. If the Dogecoin price continues to maintain both its daily support and weekly trendline above $0.24, then the analyst expects an 18% increase in price, to push it toward $0.315. Other bullish developments include the Grayscale filing with the SEC to convert its Dogecoin Trust into a full-blown ETF. The filing lists Coinbase as custodian, sticking to an established pattern with Grayscale’s crypto ETFs, and could be a rival to the highly anticipated REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF.

Title: Google Pixel 10 Pro XL Review
URL: https://www.thurrott.com/mobile/android/google-pixel/326951/google-pixel-10-pro-xl-review
Time Published: 2025-09-21T18:05:06Z
Full Content:
The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is the largest of the new Pixel smartphones and it is chock full of useful AI features. But the camera system and Pixelsnap/Qi 2.2 are what put this phone over the top. Google has been on a well-deserved victory tour since it unleashed its modern camera bar-centric hardware design with the Pixel 6 series in 2021. Since then, we saw meaningful evolutions in the Pixel 7 and 8 series, and then a major redesign with the Pixel 9 series centered on its newly floating and curved camera bar. Well, that design was so good that Google is using it again for the Pixel 10 series with just some minor iterative changes. That will bore some, I suppose, but it was the right decision. Google hit a home run with this design a year ago, and it’s as fresh and unique as ever. Heck, even Apple is copying it with the new camera “plateau” on the iPhone 17 series. Apple knows good design when it sees it. Like the Pixel 9 Pro, the Pixel 10 Pro XL has shiny metal sides that look wonderful but pick up fingerprints a bit too easily. And there’s a nice matte back, which I very much prefer to the glossy Pixel 10 back, with a larger “G” logo in the center of the hidden Pixelsnap magnetic charging ring. That said, it’s still slippery, so you’ll want a case. As with the previous several Pixel generations, the camera bar is beautiful and functional: Unlike most rival flagship smartphones, you can lay the Pixel 10 Pro XL down on a table or other surface and use it without fear of wobbling. Though the Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 9 Pro XL are the same size—6.4 x 3 x 0.3 inches—and roughly the same weight (the 10 Pro XL is a bit heavier, at 8.2 ounces–there are subtle physical differences. For example, the camera bar is a bit taller and wider this year and that G logo on the back is bigger. (Yes, that means you can’t move cases between the two phones.) The Pixel 10 Pro XL has a 6.8-inch Super Actua-branded LTPO (Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide) OLED display panel with a native resolution of 1344 x 2992 (486 PPI), a 9:20 aspect ratio, a variable refresh rate of 1 Hz to 120 Hz (that’s what LTPO does), and a 2 million to 1 contrast ratio that emits 2200 nits of brightness for HDR content and a peak brightness of 3300 nits. It supports HDR and 24-bit color, and it’s covered in Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover glass protection. This display is virtually identical to the display on last year’s Pixel 9 Pro XL. The only difference is that the brightness and peak brightness levels are both 10 percent higher on the Pixel 10 Pro XL. That should provide a small improvement in direct sunlight, but I never detected any major differences. Which is fine: This is a fantastic display, with rich colors and excellent details, even though it uses a lower-resolution of 1080 x 2404 by default to help spare the battery. This was not an issue on the Pixel 9 Pro XL so I left it on its default here as well. Adaptive brightness used to be problematic on Pixel phones, with several generations routinely dimming the screen below a comfortable level. But this is no longer an issue: As with its predecessor, I never once had to manually adjust the brightness. Google uses a punch hole cutout for the self camera, which I prefer over other positions, though it seems a bit large to me. Speaking of which, I think we’re at the point where we can’t really describe the display bezels as small. If anything they’re particularly noticeable with a case on the phone. Not objectionable in any way, of course. But noticeable. The gentle curves in the corner are nicely done, as before. And the Color contrast and Colors options are unchanged year-over-year. But I love the new screensaver feature that turns the phone into a mini-smart display when it’s not used and connected to power. This pairs nicely with the new Pixelsnap powered accessories and turns the Pixel 10 Pro XL into a neat bedside companion. With the Pixel 10 series, Google is moving to its 5th generation Tensor processor, which is based on a smaller and more efficient 3 nm manufacturing process, compared to 4 nm for the Pixel 9 series. It’s also faster, Google says, with a 34 percent gain in CPU performance and 60 percent in TPU (NPU) performance. That’s impressive, but that’s compared to the Tensor G4, and Google’s processors have never threatened Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon chips or Apple Silicon in raw performance. Yes, that is by design: Google optimizes the Tensor for its on-device AI workloads. And with the Tensor G5 in the Pixel 10 series, there are several new AI features that exist because of the improvements Google made to this chip. (More on that below.) The Pixel 10 Pro XL comes with 16 GB of RAM, the same as last year. But there are two interesting changes with the storage. The 128 GB option is gone, as it should be, with Google now offering 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB storage options. And the storage is faster. Where the Pixel 9 Pro XL utilized UFS 3.1 storage, the Pixel 10 Pro XL moves up to UFS 4.0 on the 256 GB configuration and Zoned UFS 4.0 on the 512 GB and 1 TB configurations. Whether there’s any real-world benefit to either upgrade is unclear, and I don’t have a phone to test that. But Zone UFS apparently adapts the layout of items in storage over time to optimize access speeds. And that’s the thing. In day-to-day use, the Pixel 10 Pro XL worked well, and I’ve never noticed any slowdowns, pauses, or glitches. This was true of the previous device as well, but the more efficient Tensor G5 runs cooler than its predecessor, and that leads to lower temperatures in use. And that is something I have noticed: On multiple drives with the Pixel 10 Pro XL exposed on the car’s dashboard for hours at a time, I noticed it getting warm but not overly hot. I’ve seen the Pixel 9 Pro XL switch to dark mode and issue warnings because of overheating in this scenario, so this is a worthwhile improvement. I also tested Call of Duty: Mobile on the Pixel 10 Pro XL, using the higher resolution graphical assets and an Xbox Wireless Controller, and it played perfectly, with no heat build-up or performance issues at all. The Pixel 10 Pro XL supports Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth v6, the latter of which is a first for me. It supports all the Gs (to speak) for broadband cellular, of course, including 5G with mmWave + Sub6GHz, though the little window for that in the top of the Pixel 9 Pro XL is no longer present this year. I use Google Fi for cellular, and I switched over my phone number to the Pixel 10 Pro XL and used it in Pennsylvania and in Berlin, Germany and never had any issues. Note that if you live in the U.S., Google is no longer providing a nano-SIM tray. Instead, you can store 8 eSIMs and have two active at a time. I think we’re at the point where going all-eSIM is the way to go, so I have no issues there. As with its predecessor, the Pixel 10 Pro XL provides a terrific multimedia experience thanks to its support for HDR+ and stereo speakers. Video looks terrific, and the selfie camera punch hole seems to disappear as you pay attention to the content. Interestingly, the stereo sound appears to be better balanced this year: The left (top) speaker is part of the earpiece and tends to be less loud on most phones, including the Pixel 9 Pro XL, giving sound a bit of a right bias. But that’s much less pronounced with the Pixel 10 Pro XL. And the speakers get loud, without any distortion, though you get some case vibration and echo at 100 percent volume. The Pixel 10 Pro XL supports spatial audio but only via compatible earbuds. I purchased a pair of Pixel Buds Pro 2 earbuds that do support this feature, along with head-tracking. I will review those separately, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a nice combination for gaming, listening, or viewing on the go. The Pixel 10 Pro XL provides a terrific three-lens rear camera system, though it’s nearly identical to what we got last year in the Pixel 9 Pro XL. This time around, the major advances come from AI, a Google strength, with unique capabilities that in some cases are unlocked by the Pixel’s Tensor G5 processor. This makes sense. The Pixel lineup has focused on computational photography since the original release in 2016, and fans typically cite photography as a key factor in their buying decisions. So no one will be surprised to learn that the Pixel 10 Pro XL gives users an ideal camera system. And that’s true whether you just take point-and-click snapshots as I typically do, or you’re a professional who requires the pro controls that the Pixel 10 Pro XL also provides. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is now my favorite smartphone for photography. It provides the best overall camera system of the phones I’ve used, and it delivers consistently predictable high quality regardless of the conditions. This is an important point. It’s possible to take incredible photos with a flagship iPhone, but you have to babysit every shot to make sure the result it exactly what you want. With Pixel, this is automatic. So let’s start with the hardware. As noted, there are three camera lenses on the rear of the Pixel 10 Pro XL, and they’re housed as before inside the stunning rounded camera bar at the top of the phone. The main (wide) lens is a 25 mm equivalent with 50 MP of resolution, and 82-degree field of view (FOV), an f/1.68 aperture, dual-pixel phase detection (PDAF), optical image stabilization (OIS), and electronic image stabilization (EIS). Google says that the OIS has been enhanced this year, resulting in smoother, less jittery video recordings. The ultra-wide lens is a 13 mm equivalent with 48 MP of resolution, a 123-degree FOV, an f/2.8 aperture, dual-pixel PDAF, and auto-focus. Edge distortion is minimal, and while this is subtle, these photos are less distorted at the edges than the ultra-wide shots the smaller Pixel 10 shoots. The periscope telephoto lens is a 113 mm equivalent with 48 MP of resolution, a 22-degree FOV, an f/2.8 aperture, dual-pixel PDAF, OIS, EIS, and 5x optical zoom. I was surprised that Google didn’t up the optical zoom to 8x in this release, but the telephoto lens now supports Super Res Zoom (using machine learning) to 29x and Pro Res Zoom (using generative AI) from 30x to 100x. And this change is the single biggest—and best—improvement in the Pixel 10 Pro XL camera system. I wrote about the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s telephoto capabilities in Paul’s Pixel 10 Diaries: Camera Deep Dive (Premium), but the short version is that Pro Res Zoom works, and most of the time, it works quite well. Where previous Pixel flagships could theoretically capture images at up to 30x using Super Res Zoom, I experienced declining quality north of 20x and usually tried to limit myself to that. But the Pixel 10 Pro XL delivers very good quality to about 70x when taking photos by hand, instead of using a tripod. And even 100x is doable if you choose the right subject—buildings and other well-defined objects are a good choice—and can counter the movement in the viewfinder. To be clear, there are caveats: The generative AI capabilities of Pro Res Zoom work best with certain subjects and this is one instance in which it’s wise to take multiple shots and babysit the results a bit, as I always do with the iPhone. Less obviously, Pro Res Zoom requires you to stick to the default 12 MP resolution setting for photos; if you choose to shoot at full-resolution (typically 50 MP), the Pixel works as it did before and offers Super Res Zoom up to 30x instead. That’s not an issue for me, as I do stick with the defaults having experimented with full-resolution shots. And you can always save photos as JPEGs and RAW files, which will give you more editing controls, though at the lower resolution in both cases. I was curious whether the Pixel 10 Pro XL with Pro Res Zoom could outperform recent Samsung Galaxy S Ultra models, which can deliver incredible long-distance shots. And that’s hit or miss: Thanks to some chicanery, my wife’s Galaxy S24 Ultra delivers crisp, clear moon photos that I could never duplicate with the Pixel 10 Pro XL. But when comparing the phones during the day, the Pixel often did a better job of summoning details—or creating them, I guess—at very high zoom levels, where the Samsung just delivered a muddy mess. Put simply, these long distance zoom shots were the one area where Pixel fell short of the most expensive Galaxy handsets. But that’s not the case anymore. The front selfie camera is a single 17 mm equivalent ultra-wide lens with 42 MP of resolution, a 103-degree FOV, an f/2.2 aperture, and PDAF. This appears unchanged year-over-year, and it offers the same 0.7x and 1x zoom controls to take advantage of its wide field-of-view. I’m not much of a selfie taker, but this lens works as automatically and consistently well as the rear camera system. And there’s a neat palm timer feature that lets you use the camera normally, with no timer, but start a 3-second timer countdown on the fly by placing your palm in front of the camera to give yourself a moment to frame the shot correctly. That’s a terrific idea, and it works with the rear camera as well, though I never found a use for it there. Not surprisingly, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is packed with helpful camera and photography features. Here, I will focus on the new and improved features. Beginners can use the Camera Coach to get AI-based recommendations for framing a shot on the fly and other suggestions. (You can learn more about this in Paul’s Pixel 10 Diaries: Camera Coach, but it’s surprisingly useful.) And there’s a new “Help me edit” feature that lets you use natural language to tell Google Photos how you want a photo to be edited. (I can’t take a screenshot of this at the moment because this feature is U.S. only and I’m in Mexico as I write this. Doy.) Panorama shots now work with the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s 5x optical zoom plus the Camera app’s Shadows, Exposure, White Balance, and Focus controls for the first time. If you choose to shoot at native resolution, you can also get up to 100 MP images now in this mode. You can use Google’s Veo 3 AI model to make short video clips from any photo in Google Photos. The results are always impressive, and sometimes eerily so, with people in photos moving in space, looking at each, and interacting naturally. You can learn more about my experiences with the Pixel 10 Pro XL camera system in Paul’s Pixel 10 Diaries: Completing Setup, First AI and Photo Experiences and Paul’s Pixel 10 Diaries: Camera Deep Dive (Premium). But my initial worries that the minor hardware upgrades would result in an off year are unfounded. The Pixel 10 Pro XL takes absolutely fantastic photos across the board. I will be examining its video capabilities soon in that Paul’s Pixel 10 Diaries series as well. While I still feel that the Face ID system Apple provides with the iPhone is the fastest and most reliable biometric authentication system on mobile, the Pixel 10 Pro XL acquits itself nicely in this category as well. It offers Face Unlock and Fingerprint Unlock, the latter via an ultrasonic fingerprint reader under the display, and both work well, though Face Unlock is useless in anything other than good lighting and it doesn’t like sunglasses. I also configured my Pixel Watch 3 to unlock the phone, which adds another level of convenience. (Yes, an Apple Watch works similarly with the iPhone.) I just want to get into the phone, no matter the lighting, as quickly as possible, and while still maintaining an acceptable level of security. As with the previous few Pixel generations, Google outfits the Pixel 10 Pro XL with its Titan M2 security processor with Trusty (Trusted Execution Environment) and anti-malware and anti-phishing protection. VPN by Google is free to Pixel customers. It’s not particularly configurable, you can just toggle it on or off, and it’s a bit difficult to find because it’s part of the Settings app. But it’s a nice perk that works system-wide and supports per-app exclusions and automatic pausing on selected networks. And there is a handy Quick setting in the Notification shade once you figure out it’s there. The Pixel 10 Pro XL gets 7 years of OS and security updates. I would never use a phone that long, but that support lifecycle is as good as it gets in mobile. Tensor-based Pixels have always offered average battery life compared to the latest iPhones and most Samsung flagships. (The Galaxy S25+ and Edge being key exceptions.) That trend continues with the Pixel 10 series: You should be able to get through an average day without worrying about the battery, as I did. But if you’re taking a lot of photos, while on vacation, perhaps, or just out in the world using Google Maps, Uber, or whatever else more than usual, you’ll want to bring a charger. Or better yet, a Pixelsnap wireless charger. In the good news department, charging speeds are nicely improved: The Pixel 10 Pro XL can charge its 5200m Ah battery at up to 45 watts over USB-C now, with a compatible charger (not included in the box), and it can achieve a nearly 70 charge in just 30 minutes. And using a compatible Pixelsnap/Qi 2.2 wireless charger, you can charge at up to 25 watts. By comparison, the Pixel 9 Pro XL could charge its slightly smaller 5060 mAh battery at up to 37 watts over USB, 23 watts wirelessly using a proprietary (non-Qi) PixelStand, or 15 watts using Qi. But previous-generation Pixels also lack the Pixelsnap/Qi 2.2 magnets and MagSafe compatibility. There is one downside to the addition of MagSafe/Qi 2.2: Unlike its predecessor, the Pixel 10 Pro XL, like the other Pixel 10 series phones, does not support reverse wireless charging. The most profound hardware upgrade with the Pixel 10 Pro XL is the addition of Qi 2.2 wireless charging, which opens up these phones to the wonderful ecosystem of MagSafe-compatible peripherals as well as Google’s new Pixelsnap-branded accessories. Qi 2.2 makes wireless charging even better, with up to 25 watts of charging power and magnets in the phone and in compatible peripherals ensuring fast charging speeds and a solid connection. I’ve used the Pixel 10 Pro XL with several Qi 2.x/MagSafe-compatible peripherals, most recently the mini MagSafe tripod that I keep here in Mexico. And this feature is a game changer. It’s not the reason to buy a Pixel 10 series phone, but it is absolutely a reason. As is the incredible software that Google provides on these handsets. The Pixel 10 Pro XL shipped with a highly optimized Android 16 and the Quarter Platform Release 1 (QPR1) update, which includes the delightful Material Expressive 3 design throughout the system and, increasingly, in Google’s in-box apps. This is a far more successful and far less controversial make-over than Apple’s Liquid Glass. It’s not just attractive, it also enhances usability with new control styles that can expand and grow to better work with your fingers. It’s like Liquid Glass without the Glass. You can see the impact of Material Expressive 3 throughout the Pixel user experience. The lock screen can be customized with fun 3D motion effects, similar to what Apple offers, but also unique shape and weather effects. The always-on display can now optionally display the lock screen wallpaper with a nice dimmed and blurred effect. You can add a new calling card to any contact, providing a gorgeous full-screen experience when that person calls you on the phone. There’s a new Screen saver feature that displays a smart display-like screen when the Pixel is charging. It works in portrait and landscape modes, supports clock, weather, and photo slideshow views, and thanks to its low-light mode, it’s a neat thing to have if you keep the phone by your bedside. Some Material Expressive 3 tweaks are minor, like the on-screen volume controls and the newly colorful Settings app. But some are more in your face, like the quick settings tiles in the Notification shade. They’re fully customizable now and can be resized between squircles or rounded rectangles, and repositioned as needed, and there’s an incredible range of tiles you can add to make this interface your own. This is nicely done. Google markets Pixel as the helpful phone, and that can be seen throughout the software that it provides on these devices. And while AI has always been core to the value proposition, its use has exploded in recent years, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL delivers the most impressive set of end-to-end solutions yet. Just listing all these features would be problematic, and fully documenting them would require a book-length work. But I will try to provide a reasonable overview of the new features here, with the understanding that this all builds on years of work making these phones helpful in meaningful ways. First up, all Pixel 10 series customers get one year of Google AI Pro for free, providing you with 2 TB of Google Drive storage, access to Google’s most advanced Gemini models, and higher usage limits across the board. This is a nice perk, and it makes the Gemini app on the Pixel 10 Pro XL far more powerful and useful. For example, you can use Deep Research to create reports grounded in hundreds of websites or documents. And you can use the in-box NotebookLM app to organize notes and other information and learn more about particular topics. Gemini is now the default personal assistant on the new Pixels, replacing the Google Assistant, and it supports Gemini Live for ongoing conversations with the assistant and learning more about what you see on the screen, including through the Camera app’s viewfinder. I’m still trying to get comfortable with this type of functionality, but there’s no denying its usefulness: You can learn more about anything you’re looking at, whether it’s a business or other site out in the world or any item. It’s been incredibly accurate: When I pointed it at our Bluetooth speaker and asked what it was, Gemini correctly identified it as a JBL Charge 5, not just a JBL or JBL Charge speaker. And you can trigger Gemini Live by pressing and holding on the Pixel’s power button, which is handy. Magic Cue could emerge as a marquee new feature on the Pixel 10 series, though it’s limited for now and will expand dramatically over time. Put simply, Magic Cue works with a customizable list of compatible apps—Contacts, Google Calendar, Gmail, Keep Notes, Messages, and Pixel Screenshots for now—and surfaces relevant information proactively as you use the phone. I’ve seen Magic Cue pop-up most frequently in Messages. For example, if my wife asks me about dinner reservations via text, Magic Cue displays a little bubble under the question in Messages that lists the date, time, and place I saved that information in Calendar. This works similarly for questions about flight times, another contact’s phone number, and the like. Voice Translate works like Conversation mode in the Google Translate app but using the Phone app instead. I’ve not tested this yet, but now that we’re in Mexico I will almost certainly have the opportunity to use it in a real-world scenario. Basically, you make a phone call and enable Voice Translate (via Call Assist), and the Pixel alerts both parties about what it’s doing. Then, both people speak normally and each hears the speech using their native language. There’s a new Pixel Journal for jotting down thoughts and other things as they occur, but some of the existing Pixel-exclusive apps get exciting new features this year as well. For example, the Recorder app is already incredible, providing transcripts that identify each speaker, a feature I used for this article during a meeting with Lenovo. But now it also creates music for you on the fly using its recordings, which is pretty freaky. To test this, I cropped that meeting recording (it has to be 3 minutes long or less), selected “Create music” from the “More” (“…”) menu, and then chose the “Rainy day” vibe from a long list of choices. It analyzed the recording, worked its magic, and then created a version of the meeting recording with background guitars timed to the speech. Gboard is Google’s virtual keyboard and it’s been enhanced with Writing Tools to fix writing mistakes like grammar, typing, and punctuation on the fly and the ability to edit voice-dictated messages using natural voice commands. That latter feature is useful for those like me who rely on dictating by voice. For example, when I said the word “Rubi,” which is a bar and restaurant here in Mexico City, Gboard wrote that as “Ruby,” so I then said, “Change Ruby to Rubi with an I,” and it made that change. (That said, it was less successful with “Form + Matter,” which couldn’t get past “plus sign.”) And Pixel Studio, Google’s text-to-image creation utility, has been updated to use Imagen 4, the latest version of this model, plus new fonts, stickers, and other graphical assets. The results are impressive, and it supports a long list of styles so you can customize each creation accordingly. The Pixel 10 Pro XL starts at $1199, which is $100 more than the starting price of its predecessor. But not really: The base Pixel 10 Pro XL now comes with 256 GB, not 128 GB as before, and so it’s the same price for that amount of storage. You can choose 512 GB and 1 TB configurations for $1319 and $1549, respectively, and choose between four colors: Moonstone (a sort of medium gray-blue), Jade (a light green with gold accents), Porcelain (which is similar to Apple’s Starlight, a champagne-like color), and Obsidian (black). Unfortunately, not all color choices come in all the available storage configurations. And as bad, the base model is the same price as the base model iPhone 17 Pro Max. Fortunately, Apple’s storage upgrades are more expensive—$1399 and $1599, respectively—though one can also get an iPhone with 2 TB of storage for $1999. Yikes. The review unit that Google lent me came in Moonstone. I would have personally chosen Porcelain, not that it matters, since I would never spend this much money on a phone, a device this clumsy human carries with him everywhere he goes all day long every day, and not use a protective case. Which will add another $50 to the purchase price if you go with the stock Google Pixelsnap Case, as I did. The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL consistently takes the best photos of any smartphone I’ve used, and it’s packed to the gills with truly useful features that surface almost every time I unlock it. The display is nearly perfect, Google seems to have gotten in front of the heat issues from previous Tensor-based Pixels, and the support lifecycle is the best in the industry. Yes, it’s big and heavy, but so are the flagships from Apple and Samsung. Less defensible is the pricing, which I feel should undercut the competition. But Google offers solid trade-ins to owners of previous Pixels, and that will help soften the blow. My Pixel 9 Pro XL with 128 GB of storage is worth $413 on trade right now, but it was worth $600 at launch and Google will likely raise trade-in values again at Black Friday and other promotional times. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is highly recommended.

Title: BlackRock Leads Spot ETH ETF Inflows With Over $500M, Ethereum Possibly On Track To $5,000

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum’s institutional narrative is strengthening as US-based Spot ETF trackers witnessed another week of inflows last week. BlackRock’s ETHA fund captured the majority of this activity with more than half a billion dollars in new investments, while other ETFs struggled with minor outflows. At the same time, technical patterns are aligning with this buying pressure, which has given many analysts confidence that the Ethereum price could be preparing to push towards its all-time high in the coming weeks. Last week was another positive week for Spot Ethereum ETFs. Across all issuers in the US, Spot Ethereum ETFs added $556.92 million in inflows during the week, making it the second consecutive week of positive institutional inflows. Cumulative inflows since launch are now over $13.9 billion, and these ETFs now hold $29.64 billion worth of Ethereum. Interestingly, data from Farside Investor’s Spot ETF tracker reveal that the majority of last week’s institutional inflows went into BlackRock’s ETHA. The inflow numbers show that BlackRock’s ETHA product absorbed roughly $513 million in net inflows between September 15 and 19. The largest portion came on Monday with over $360 million, followed by another $140 million inflow as the week drew to a close on Friday, which was enough to offset corresponding outflows from every other issuer that day. This shows how investors continue to favor BlackRock’s offering as the primary gateway for regulated Ethereum exposure. Other issuers experienced a more mixed week. Fidelity’s FETH product posted sharp redemptions, most notably $53.4 million in outflows on Friday, September 19. However, these outflows were partially balanced by $159.4 million in inflows on Thursday. Bitwise and Grayscale also witnessed days of inflows, which was enough to cancel out minor outflows during the week. Spot Ethereum ETF Flows: Farside Investors Another week of institutional inflow could set the stage for bullish price action in the new week, which in turn would certify a bullish monthly close for Ethereum in September. In fact, analyses from different analysts have looked at multiple bullish patterns forming across different timeframes on the Ethereum price chart. One particularly notable observation came from VasilyTrader on the TradingView platform, who highlighted encouraging signals on Ethereum’s shorter-term charts. His analysis of the 4-hour candlestick timeframe suggested that the recent pullback has now given way to a bullish confirmation. He identified a clear double bottom pattern that formed early last week, which was followed by a breakout from a falling wedge formation by Friday’s close. Based on these developments, VasilyTrader set his next price target at no less than $4,741. Chart Image From TradingView: VasilyTrader At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,485. According to crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades, ETH is still on track to reach $5,000 as long as it holds above $4,400.

Title: The ultimate Blue Ridge Parkway road trip guide

Time Published: 2025-09-21T16:00:09Z

Search The Points Guy Nearly a year after Hurricane Helene rocked the southeastern U.S., the famed Blue Ridge Parkway — and many stops along its 469-mile route — is almost fully open again. This serpentine, two-lane ribbon of blacktop follows the twisting spine of the Blue Ridge Mountains (a subrange of the Appalachians) from Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina to Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. With a speed limit of 45 mph, the Blue Ridge Parkway sacrifices directness for mile after mile of untamed alpine beauty. You can hop on and off at countless junctions along the route, including two attractive midsize cities: Asheville, North Carolina (also open and welcoming tourists) and Roanoke, Virginia. But if you're up for a grand adventure and can spare a few days, it's well worth driving the entire parkway. You'll encounter remarkable diversions along the way: hundreds of scenic viewpoints and picnic spots, miles of hiking trails for every skill level and a bounty of engaging historic sites that shed light on Appalachian heritage and folkways. From south to north, here's a look at some of the most memorable stops along this magical road and helpful planning tips to get you started. Related: Not just for flights: Using points and miles to save on road trips The nearest airport to the parkway's southern tip, in the Great Smoky Mountains, is Knoxville, Tennessee's McGhee Tyson Airport (TYS), a two-hour drive. Of major airports, Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) is a good option if you are planning a round-trip car rental. It's just 3 1/2 hours from the parkway's southern end point and a 4 1/2-hour drive (by the faster interstate highways) from the northern end point, at the entrance of Shenandoah. Atlanta is also 3 1/2 hours from the south end of the parkway, and the drive up through Georgia's Appalachian Mountains is quite beautiful. It's a great way to extend your adventure. From the north end of the Blue Ridge Parkway, Dulles International Airport (IAD) near Washington, D.C., is a 2 1/2-hour drive. Although there's no fee to drive the Blue Ridge Parkway, you'll need to pay $30 per private vehicle to enter Shenandoah National Park (unless you have a park pass), and Great Smoky Mountains National Park charges parking fees. By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy. You may unsubscribe at any time. The scenery along the parkway really sings anytime from spring through fall, but May through mid-June stands out especially for viewing wildflowers and rhododendrons in bloom, and mid-September through mid-October is best for admiring brilliant fall foliage. Temperatures along the parkway tend to be five to 10 degrees lower than in the region's lower elevations, making this drive a potentially cool escape from summer heat. On the other hand, this means snow and ice are possible in winter, the one season when many facilities along the road are closed. Keep in mind that this curving and relatively narrow road is prone to fog and wild animal crossings at any time of year. It's best to drive it only during daylight hours, both for safety and the best views, and to exercise caution during heavy rain. How long does this road trip take? It's theoretically possible to drive the entire route in three days, but you'll have a far more enjoyable experience if you allow five days at a leisurely pace. With a full week, you'll have more than enough time to explore Great Smoky Mountains and Shenandoah national parks, too. The Blue Ridge Parkway begins close to the Oconaluftee Visitor Center in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. This rugged 522,419-acre swath of pristine forests, open meadows and meandering streams is the largest national park east of the Mississippi. In a single day, you can ascend to the observation tower atop 6,643-foot Clingmans Dome and explore the open-air Mountain Farm Museum — or head to the Tennessee section of the park to drive the enchanting Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail and hop out for a short trek to Grotto Falls. Once you enter the parkway, you have about 90 miles ahead of you to Asheville. This section has some of the most dramatic scenic pullouts along the entire route, with Waterrock Knob (milepost 451) a particular highlight. There are a small visitor center and a picnic area, and the views are incredible at sunset. The other stop worth noting is Mount Pisgah (milepost 408). Allow a couple of hours for the steep but well-trodden 2.6-mile round-trip hike to this 5,721-foot peak that offers a vast panorama of nearby Asheville. After being ravaged by Hurricane Helene, the small city of Asheville is back and better than ever. With a fantastic culinary and craft beer scene and a thriving artist community, Asheville has enough to keep you busy for several days, including two notable stops along the parkway: the Blue Ridge Parkway Visitor Center, with its engrossing exhibits on the road's natural and human history, and the superb Folk Art Center (particularly Allanstand Craft Shop). In Asheville itself, set aside time to explore the greenery of The North Carolina Arboretum, peruse the galleries of the hip River Arts District (or even try your hand at an art class) and eat your way through buzzy food-and-drink neighborhoods like South Slope and West Asheville. With its chateauesque, 250-room mansion, splendid gardens and numerous other diversions, Biltmore Estate is another must — but you really need a full day to make the most of visiting this 8,000-acre property (admission starts at $70 per person). Although there are no accommodations within Great Smoky Mountains National Park, you'll find a good selection in the gateway towns of Cherokee, North Carolina (just 4 miles from the start of the Blue Ridge Parkway) and Gatlinburg, Tennessee. These mostly include no-frills options like Fairfield by Marriott Inn & Suites Cherokee (rates start at $96 or 29,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night this fall) and Econo Lodge Inn & Suites Gatlinburg at the Convention Center (starting from $52 or 20,000 Choice Privileges points per night). Asheville offers the greatest range of points hotels along the Blue Ridge Parkway. For instance, Blind Tiger Asheville, a charming bed-and-breakfast establishment in a 19th-century Queen Anne house that's part of World of Hyatt's Mr & Mrs Smith collection, has nightly rates starting at $202 or 27,000 points this fall. Or, you could book The Radical Asheville, a hip, art-inspired Hilton Honors property in the heart of the River Arts District, starting from $141 or 45,000 points per night. Related: Best road trips for visiting national parks Just northeast of Asheville, Craggy Gardens Picnic Area (milepost 364) is a shaded tract of outdoor tables with trails leading to magnificent stands of azaleas and mountain laurels. About 10 miles later, you can briefly detour up a side road to the summit of the highest point in the eastern U.S.: Mount Mitchell. A short, paved path leads to the observation deck, and there are a small museum and a casual restaurant, too. At milepost 305, you'll approach Grandfather Mountain, which offers rocky peaks you can explore by walking across a dramatic mile-high swinging bridge. Here, you'll also drive along the parkway's greatest engineering marvel, the Linn Cove Viaduct, a curving, 1,243-foot-long concrete bridge that hugs Grandfather Mountain's precipitous face. Nearby at Julian Price Memorial Park, you can rent a kayak or canoe for a refreshing paddle around Price Lake. Also check out the quaint village center of Blowing Rock, with its gift and crafts shops, as well as the interesting Blowing Rock Art & History Museum. The charming town of Blowing Rock currently has one points hotel: Holiday Inn Express Blowing Rock South, where rates this fall start from $83 or 18,000 IHG One Rewards points per night. Other notable options include the woodsy-chic Mountainaire Inn & Log Cabins (starting around $134 per night), bookable through Chase Travel℠, and the alpine chalet-inspired Switzerland Inn (starting around $109 per night), available on Capital One Travel. Related: How the Capital One Venture X travel credit can save you $300 on your next trip As you approach Virginia, stop for lunch at the parkway's oldest eatery, The Bluffs (milepost 238), a restored 1940s rustic-style diner known for fried chicken lunches. Then, take a walk around nearby Brinegar Cabin, a small late-19th-century homestead that's typical of those that once proliferated in these mountains. Highlights after crossing the state line include the easy 2-mile-loop waterfall hike at Cumberland Knob (milepost 218) and the nearby outdoor Blue Ridge Music Center, which stages folk and country concerts throughout the summer. At historic Mabry Mill (milepost 176), you can watch docents working in the historic sawmill and blacksmith shop and dine in the colorful restaurant (known for its freshly baked blackberry cobbler). You'll encounter the turnoff for picturesque Mill Mountain Greenway, which leads into Roanoke, at milepost 120. Stop at Mill Mountain Park for a grand view of the city, save time for a walk through the small zoo and garden, if possible, on your way into town. Give yourself at least a half day to get to know this bustling hill city with several first-rate attractions, including the Taubman Museum of Art, which is focused on regional American works, and the O. Winston Link Museum, with its railway photography housed inside a vintage train station. Pick up locally sourced food at Historic Roanoke City Market, and hunt for Appalachian antiques and architectural wares at famed Black Dog Salvage. Roanoke makes for a convenient overnight base, and it offers a few lodging options bookable with points. The Hotel Roanoke & Conference Center stands out for its 1880s Tudor-style design and its refined restaurant serving French cuisine with a Southern twist. You can book it for as low as $194 or 58,000 Hilton Honors points per night this fall. And you can get solid value for your World of Hyatt points at the Category 1 Hyatt Place Roanoke Airport/Valley View Mall (from $94 or 3,500 points per night). From Roanoke, you have about 115 miles left to go. Make time for a detour into the cute hamlet of Buchanan, Virginia, where you can venture across a vintage swinging bridge over the James River, and stop for a hike along one of the easy but rewarding trails at the Peaks of the Otter area (milepost 86). At milepost 0, the Blue Ridge Parkway ends on an overpass above Interstate Highway 64. Or, to be more precise, it transitions into Skyline Drive, the 105-mile scenic route through Shenandoah National Park. This curvaceous and lofty thoroughfare feels quite similar to the Blue Ridge Parkway. The main difference is that the speed limit is lower (35 mph), and you'll pay a $30-per-vehicle fee to enter the park (unless you hold an America the Beautiful Pass or visit on a fee-free day). Related: 10 of the best national parks to visit in the fall If you're ending your trip at the parkway's northern terminus, it's an easy drive on I-64 to Staunton, Virginia (20 minutes west) or Charlottesville, Virginia (30 minutes east), which offer a few points hotels. For example, the Avid Hotel Staunton is available from $92 or 19,000 IHG One Rewards points per night this fall, and Hyatt Place Charlottesville starts at $110 or 8,000 World of Hyatt points per night. If continuing along Skyline Drive through Shenandoah National Park, consider staying in one of its handful of hotels. Some of these are available on various credit card travel portals, but they fill up fast, so book ahead. There's something special about waking up in a room high atop the park's 3,500-foot-elevation spine, with panoramic views west toward the Allegheny Mountains. Now that most major repairs have been made in the wake of Hurricane Helene, the Blue Ridge Parkway has reopened for road trips — and fall is a prime time to go. Besides everything mentioned above, you'll enjoy the added benefit of spectacular fall foliage during your drive and any hikes you take. If leaf peeping is your aim, you'll have the best chance at seeing peak colors if you drive the parkway between mid-October and early November.

ByBill Stone, Contributor. Following the Federal Reserve rate cut last Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high last Friday. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the market. As outlined previously, the Federal Reserve delivered a 25-basis-point cut at its September 17 meeting. The statement from the committee said, “downside risks to employment have risen,” which indicates that the recent softness in the monthly jobs reports has shifted the Fed back into easing mode after a nine-month hiatus. The median projections from the Fed call for 25-basis point cuts in October and December. Previously, the Fed only expected a cut at one of those meetings. Markets have also priced in at the October and December Fed meetings. Notably, the Fed’s increase in the number of median rate cuts was by a very narrow margin, so these cuts are far from a sure thing with incoming data remaining crucial. Both two-year and ten-year Treasury yields are well below their highs for the year. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Recession odds declined following the Fed rate cut announcement, and stocks reached a new all-time closing high. The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed less economically impacted defensives last week, and since the stocks bottomed in early April, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. The lessening of the odds of recession benefited the more economically sensitive stocks. Beyond this relationship, smaller capitalization stocks, using the Russell 2000 as an example, have outperformed recently. Furthermore, bank stocks have continued to outperform, benefiting from a better economic outlook and a steeper yield curve. The most direct beneficiaries of the rate cut are companies (and households) with floating-rate debt. Another transmission mechanism for lower short-term rates to positively impact the economy is the housing sector. As housing affordability hovers near all-time lows since 1989, part of the equation has been due to higher mortgage rates. This lack of affordability is most pronounced for first-time homebuyers. The expectation of a decline in short-term rates has led to the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropping from a high of 7.41% in January to 6.37% most recently. The US housing market has been limping along with a depressed level of new single-family home building. Permits for new single-family home construction show a similar poor outlook for home building. While mortgage applications for home purchases remain depressed, the trend has been moving higher since mortgage rates peaked. Notably, mortgage applications for refinancing have spiked with the lower mortgage rates. Importantly, this puts extra cash in the pockets of US households. Unfortunately, this refinancing cycle is likely to be less potent than previous cycles due to the significant amount of refinancing that occurred when rates were at ultra-low levels during the pandemic. There are only seven companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, with Costco (COST) and Micron Technology (MU) being the most notable for their economic insights. There are a whopping eighteen speeches from Federal Reserve members scheduled for this week. This Fedspeak will be closely watched for clues as to the timing of future rate cuts, none more so than Fed Chair Powell’s speech on Tuesday. Stocks continue to price in low odds of recession, given the strong performance of small companies, banks, and the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks. The Fed’s cut last week, along with the expectation of two more cuts this year, reinforced the notion that the soft spot in the labor market will not develop into a full-fledged downturn. The positive boost from easing monetary policy is lagged and variable, so it will be imperative to monitor the impact to ascertain if it is consistent with market expectations. There is little doubt that lower rates will have less potency than in previous cycles and may come at a more significant lag, given the legacy of ultra-low interest rates during the pandemic.

The Fed is back to cutting rates. What'll it do next? We'll learn more this week. After last week's decision by the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the first time this year, market watchers will be eager for clues about whether more cuts are in store in the coming months. Several data points due this week should offer insight. Stocks ended last week on the rise, with all three major U.S. indexes finishing at record highs. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure comes as policymakers watch for evidence that tariffs are working their way into consumer prices. A string of Fed officials will deliver remarks over the course of the week investors will parse for hints about the possibility of further cuts at this year's two remaining meetings. The final revision to second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) will also be in focus, as will data on home sales, jobless claims, and consumer sentiment. Traders will be watching for earnings from chipmaker Micron, retailer Costco, and used car seller CarMax. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. The Personal Consumption Expenditures index for August is set to be released on Friday. PCE inflation held relatively steady in July after accelerating in June. Friday's report will be the first reading on prices since Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that elevated inflation and a weakening labor market give policymakers "no risk-free path" forward. The Fed has projected that it’s likely to cut interest rates at upcoming meetings, but Powell said officials will be closely watching economic readings before making further moves. Several Fed officials are on the speaking calendar this week, including Powell and the Fed's newest member, Stephen Miran. Economists on Thursday will get the final revision to second-quarter GDP, which was revised higher in August. Data for both new and pending home sales in August comes amid a decline in mortgage rates in recent weeks. Data on consumer sentiment, jobless claims, and durable-goods orders are also on tap. On the corporate calendar, Micron Technology is scheduled to report results on Tuesday. The chipmaker in June reported record quarterly revenue amid booming demand for its memory chips from data center clients. Analysts are generally bullish on Micron stock, which hit a record high last week. Costco is set to report its quarterly results on Thursday. In May, the bulk retailer reported sales rose by 8% amid continued growth in same-store sales. Recent retail sales data suggested that consumers are still spending. CarMax’s earnings on the same day will provide insight into the state of the used-car market. Auto parts seller AutoZone, business services provider Cintas, and advisory firm Accenture will also report this week. Quick Links: Recap Last Week’s Trading | Latest Markets News Monday, Sept. 22 Tuesday, Sept. 23 Wednesday, Sept. 24 Thursday, Sept. 25 Friday, Sept. 26 The Federal Reserve has come through with its much-anticipated interest rate cut. But what are the implications for your savings account? Investopedia’s Sabrina Karl explains what the rate cut means for savers here.

Title: There's a New Way to Play Quarterly Earnings With Polymarket's Latest Rollout

There's a new way to make a buck on companies' earnings reports—and in some ways, this one may be the most straightforward. Predictions marketplace Polymarket last week rolled out a new category of contracts that lets users put money on whether or not a company will beat Wall Street's expectations. It's a departure from what could be considered the traditional methods involving stocks and derivatives, but it's also a simplified way for people to profit from publicly-traded companies' bottom lines. A handful of well-known companies, including Micron Tech (MU), CarMax (KMX), and Costco (COST), are due to report in the coming weeks, and Polymarket has contracts for all of them. Here's how the new offering will work: Users can bet on the question of whether Costco will beat its quarterly estimate for earnings per share. At recent prices, a "yes" bet costs 79 cents and a "no" is 22 cents, indicating that the latter is seen as less likely. That means a winning $100 wager could result in a net profit of $21 on a beat, or $78 on a miss. Bloomberg's consensus estimates are used to determine wins and losses; if earnings aren't reported as scheduled, and don't land within 45 days, the contract is resolved as a "no." (If the earnings match estimates, it's a loss.) A wrong bet leaves you with nothing. There are, of course, other ways to go about this. One could trade a company's stock—long or short—or associated call and put options ahead of earnings reports, but those aren't so much direct bets on the results as tied to price movements that could be driven by the company's forward guidance, how optimistic or pessimistic management sounded during its earnings call, the earnings themselves, or other factors. When buying the stock, of course, you also own an asset that, broadly speaking, can be held as long as desired. Other prediction markets, like Kalshi, offer contracts on what might be mentioned on a company's earnings call, but not one specifically for earnings beats. Polymarket's new contracts are part of a broader trend marrying moneyed matters with social media. The prediction market platform launched the earnings report bets as they partnered with StockTwits, where users of the finance-focused social media platform will be able to view the probabilities of market-moving events on Polymarket directly in its app. Polymarket contracts aren't yet available in the U.S., though that seems to be moving closer to reality. The company is in the middle of a comeback in the U.S. after the the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission and Justice Department ended a probe into the company without filing charges. Polymarket did not respond to Investopedia's request for comment on the timing of its U.S. launch in time for publication. "Polymarket has been given the green light to go live in the USA by the @CFTC. Credit to the Commission and Staff for their impressive work. This process has been accomplished in record timing," Shayne Coplan, chief of Polymarket, said on social media in reference to the regulator's no-action letter on events contracts earlier this month.

The stock market may be feeling a little bubbly, but it is nothing like the parabolic, internet-hyped tech trade of the late 1990s. Oracle’s near 40% one-day surge last week on a bullish forecast stirred up memories of that frothy period—and some concern about excess AI optimism. But there is a big difference between now and the stock market party of 1999: Companies now are making real money. Back then, “the price performance was insane," said Dan Greenhaus, strategist at Solus Alternative Asset Management. “Stocks were splitting multiple times a year because the appreciation was so great." “Everything was going public, whether they had any sales or not. There was a level of enthusiasm across markets and sectors that really doesn’t feel similar to today." Today’s major tech companies are pricey, but nowhere close to “dot-com bubble valuations," Greenhaus said. The bull market could run longer. Famously, former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan used the term “irrational exuberance" to describe elevated asset prices in December 1996, years before the market peaked. Tech stocks tied to AI are benefiting from real impacts on their earnings. Market darling Nvidia “keeps going up in general, but it isn’t getting more expensive," Greenhaus said. The stock’s rise is driven by “extreme earnings and sales revisions," not just valuations, he said. Oracle’s big stock move came after the company reported an AI revenue forecast much stronger than the market expected. It now sees its cloud infrastructure revenue reaching $144 billion over the next four years, up from a projected $18 billion this fiscal year. The companies driving the market today “have so much excess cash flow that they’re buying back their stock," said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. “They can still spend on capital expenditure and research and development, and they still have plenty of money to buy back their stocks. That was the exact opposite of the tech bubble," Rieder said. Rieder said AI adoption is “an extraordinary expenditure that is changing the economic landscape" with the power to bring about huge gains in productivity. The breadth of the AI trade is also much greater than the internet and Y2K focused trade of the late 1990s and early 2000. Stocks that were considered “old economy" at the time traded with low valuations, while internet-related plays commanded sky high premiums. The market is treating AI innovation differently. Evercore ISI describes its influence on stocks as a “participatory democracy," with the potential to benefit the companies that create it, support it, and use it. AI can create winners across industries, well beyond tech. The firm notes that a quarter of companies are adopting AI just three years after the public launch of ChatGPT. During the last two years of the tech bubble, more stocks were going down daily than were rising, signaling a serious deterioration in the health of the market, according to Evercore ISI. That is opposite what is happening now, with more stocks advancing, taking indexes higher. The broader profit picture is also different. “Intel, Sun Micro, Cisco, Microsoft, the big guys were profitable then. It was the huge satellite of peripheral companies that weren’t profitable," Greenhaus said. Amazon, one of the tech heavyweights in the Magnificent 7, wasn’t profitable during the tech bubble. Its first quarterly profit was in 2021. “The best money wasn’t made on the companies that were building the internet. The best money was made on the companies that became the business because of the internet. Amazon, for instance," Greenhaus said. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said she is seeing some signs of froth in the market. But she believes the bull market will continue. “When sentiment gets to the frothier end of the spectrum, that sentiment can last for a long time," said Sonders. While the Magnificent 7 stocks have fueled much of the gains in the S&P 500, the tech giants, including Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, aren’t the biggest gainers in the stock market this year, she notes. Meta is the best performing Mag 7 stock in the S&P 500, but it is the 57th best performing stock in the S&P, while Alphabet was 58th, according to Schwab. Sonders said she currently isn’t recommending specific sectors, or even just high-quality stocks. She sees “opportunity a little bit down the quality spectrum into some of the more value-oriented areas, but you don’t want to sacrifice decent growth opportunities." She looks for factors like positive earnings revisions, positive earnings surprises, low price-to-book, low-price-to-sales, and amount of free cash flow. Some strategists have been expecting a correction to tamp down some of the market’s enthusiasm. Sonders said there has been a rolling correction across the market. She notes the S&P 500 was down 19% at its low point this year, while at the average member level, the drawdown was 25% from the year-to-date highs. The S&P quickly recovered and went on to set new highs. Sonders said the biggest gainers of the Nasdaq currently include small, lesser-known stocks. “There are retail traders’ fingerprints all over this market move. They are sort of full steam ahead—and they buy the dip, buy every little dip. And so at some point you could argue, the music ends. But it could last awhile."

Title:  Is AI a bubble? - by Azeem Azhar and Nathan Warren
URL: https://www.exponentialview.co/p/is-ai-a-bubble
Time Published: 2025-09-21T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
A month ago, I set out to answer a deceptively simple question: Is AI a bubble? Since 2024, people have been asking me this as I’ve spoken at events around the world. Even as Wall Street bankers largely see this as an investment boom, more people are asking the question in meeting rooms and conference halls in Europe and the US. Some have made up their minds. Gary Marcus called it a “peak bubble.” The Atlantic warns that there is a “possibility that we’re currently experiencing an AI bubble, in which investor excitement has gotten too far ahead of the technology’s near-term productivity benefits. If that bubble bursts, it could put the dot-com crash to shame – and the tech giants and their Silicon Valley backers won’t be the only ones who suffer.” The Economist said that “the potential cost has risen alarmingly high.” The best way to understand a question like this is to create a framework, one that you can update as new evidence emerges. Putting this together has taken dozens of hours of data analysis, modeling and numerous conversations with investors and executives. This essay is that framework: five gauges to weigh genAI against history’s bubbles. I studied and lived through the dot-com bubble. I was an investor and felt its effects firsthand.1 Like many of you, I was also active during the Global Financial Crisis. For this reason, I’ve invested considerable thought and analysis into a robust framework to understand what’s going on. I’ll share it with you today. My thinking is grounded in the study of Carlota Perez, Bill Janeway and other giants in the field, as well as financial analyses of major banks and analysts. But what I haven’t seen anywhere else is a framework that translates those theories into a practical dashboard for AI today: a set of parameters you can read, compare across past bubbles and use to orient your decisions. We will make the underlying data and methodology available to members of Exponential View in the coming weeks. I usually reserve my deep dives for paying members of Exponential View. But this question is too important, and the public debate clouded by posturing, for me to keep it behind a paywall. So today’s piece is free for everyone to read. If you want to access this analysis as a PDF, you can download it here. If you are an investor or executive navigating these questions, I am opening a very limited number of consultation sessions to work directly on them. This is a bespoke opportunity to stress-test your strategy with the same analytical framework I’ve developed. You can apply here. Bubbles are among the oldest stories of capitalism. They’re parables of excess, belief and collapse. But bubbles are not just financial phenomena; they are cultural artifacts. They return again and again as morality tales about greed and folly. Tulip mania, often misremembered as a frenzy of bankrupt weavers and drowning merchants, was less disastrous than legend suggests. It was confined to wealthy merchants and left the Dutch economy largely unscathed. But the myth has endured, and that is the point: bubbles become stories we tell ourselves about the dangers of optimism. Some bubbles are financial: the South Sea frenzy of the 1720s, the roaring stock market of the 1920s, Japan’s real-estate boom in the 1980s and the housing crash of 2008.2 Some are technological. In the 1840s, railways were hailed as the veins of a new industrial body. They were. But a body needs only so many veins, and tracks were soon laid in places commerce could not sustain. Telecoms in the 1990s promised a wired utopia, only for 70 million miles of excess fiber to lie dark underground. The dot-com boom gave us visions of a new economy, much of which did eventually materialize, but not before valuations evaporated in 2000. The funny thing is that there doesn’t seem to be an academic consensus on what an investment bubble is. Nobel laureate in economics Eugene Fama has gone so far as to say they don’t exist. I want to go beyond the notion that we know a bubble when we see a bubble. There are two interrelated systems at work. The first, the most visible, is when stock markets become absurdly overvalued and collapse. The second is whether the quantity of productive capital (going into capital expenditure or venture capital) deployed collapses. The two are related, of course. A collapse in equity prices makes investment flows more expensive. And a secular decline in productive capital investment may be read by equity markets as a harbinger of a slowdown. But to frame this: we see a bubble as being a 50% drawdown from the peak equity value that is sustained for at least five years. In the case of the US housing bubble and the dot-com, that trough was roughly five years long. Full recovery to pre-bubble peaks took 10 years for US housing, and 15 for the dot-com. Alongside, we would expect a substantial decline in the rate of productive capital deployed, once again 50% from peak. For the purposes of this analysis, by “bubble” I’ll address both of those competing dimensions. Ultimately, it means a phase marked by a rapid escalation in prices and investment, where valuations drift materially away from the underlying prospects and realistic earnings power of the assets involved. Bubbles thrive on abundant capital and seductive narratives, and they tend to end in a sharp and sustained reversal that wipes out much of the paper wealth created on the way up. A “boom,” by contrast, can look very similar in its early stages with rising valuations and accelerating investment. But the crucial distinction is that, in a boom, fundamentals eventually catch up. The underlying cash flows, productivity gains, or genuine demand growth rise to meet the optimism. Booms can still overshoot, but they consolidate into durable industries and lasting economic value. Between the two lies a gray zone: periods of exuberance when it is genuinely hard to tell whether capital is building the foundations of a new economy or merely inflating prices that will not be sustained. It’s like being in the eye of a storm: you can feel the wind, rain and pressure, but you don’t yet know whether it will clear the air or flatten the house. This brings us to the present question: is AI another bubble? What unsettles many observers are the numbers. Since ChatGPT’s release in late 2022, hyperscalers have more than doubled their annual data center capex, betting heavily on the infrastructure needed to train and run ever-larger models. When Sam Altman floated a $7 trillion investment requirement last year, it sounded like hubris. Today, investors aren’t laughing; they’re wondering whether the scale of spending is sustainable. Bubbles are impossible to diagnose in real time. Only in retrospect do we know whether exuberance was justified or delusional. Rather than making a definitive call — which borders on unhelpful speculation — it’s better to benchmark today’s boom against history to spot where bubble-like dynamics may be creeping in. We’re thinking of this as flying a plane. Pilots don’t rely on a single instrument. They monitor a cluster of gauges to understand how the flight is going. We’ll use five of them here: Gauge 1 – Economic strain: Is investment now large enough to bend the economy? Gauge 2 – Industry strain: Are industry revenues commensurate with the deployed capex? Gauge 3 – Revenue growth: Is revenue rising/broadening fast enough to catch up? Gauge 4 – Valuation heat: How hot are valuations? Compared to history, are stocks excessively overpriced? Gauge 5 – Funding quality: What kind of money is funding this? Is it strong balance sheets, or fragile, flighty capital? In the rest of the essay, I look at each gauge to explain why it may be green, amber or red, and at the end I pull them together into a full dashboard view. The investment underway is vast, with Morgan Stanley expecting $3 trillion in AI infrastructure spend by 2029. But it has not yet reached the runaway extremes of history’s great blowouts. What makes this dimension tricky is dependence. In the US, more than a third of GDP growth can be traced to data center construction. This is not inherently bad, but it may be dangerous if the momentum falters. An economy leaning this heavily on one sector for growth can find the ground falling away faster than expected. The surge of capital expenditure (capex), poured into the physical infrastructure that AI demands, is an act of optimism. This is what capex is. Money spent today in the belief that it will become a funnel of revenue tomorrow. If it’s well-placed today, it will eventually lead to productivity gains and economic expansion. If you want to sell people hula hoops to promote their health and happiness, you need to buy hula hoops first. And somewhere down the line, there needs to be a factory making them. Funding that factory is capex. You deploy the capex to build a useful thing that you can sell. Capex investment is often, but not always, a precursor to a growing business. AI data centers have a similar quality, and something more. They are not just factories for a single product; they are infrastructure. Microsoft, OpenAI and the US government all see it this way. They see compute as a foundational utility of the 21st century, no less critical than highways, railways, power grids or telecom networks were in earlier eras. I made the same argument in my last book, so you can guess where I stand. Excluding the US, sovereign governments have made more than $1 trillion in commitments to AI as infrastructure by 2030. To build such infrastructure inevitably requires historic sums, on a par with the railway and electricity build-outs of the past. McKinsey projects that meeting AI-driven demand by 2030 will require around 156 GW of new electrical capacity — the size of Spain’s and Portugal’s grids combined. The firm estimates this will cost $5-7.9 trillion in capital spending. For context, this is about twenty times the cost of the Apollo missions. This would place AI data centers among the largest infrastructure build-outs in modern history. But useful though infrastructure is, especially when private capital gets involved, things can get divorced from reality. The financing structure matters as much as the technology itself. The railways in the US were largely privately funded and suffered from multiple investment bubbles. Electricity and road systems, by contrast, benefited from greater public investment and coordination, and were less prone to speculative excess. A boom becomes dangerous when the resources it demands start to bend the whole economy around it. Wages get sucked into one sector, supply chains reorient to serve it and capital markets grow dependent on it. The snapback is vicious when expectations break. One way to gauge the economic strain is to look at investment as a share of GDP, the portion of national output funneled into a single technological frontier. It is a crude but telling ratio. It shows how heavily the economy leans on one technological bet. In the case of AI infrastructure, most of that spending takes the form of capital expenditures: the servers, cooling systems, networking gear, shells of concrete and steel and the power infrastructure required to keep them running. By that measure, the railway bubbles were the heaviest. In the United States, railway spending peaked at around 4% of GDP in 1872, just before the first great crash. The telecom boom of the late 1990s, by contrast, topped out near 1% of GDP, a level that looks familiar today. The AI build-out sits in this middle zone. Around $370 billion is expected to flow into data centers globally in 2025, with perhaps 70% earmarked for the US,3 or roughly 0.9% of American GDP. Goldman Sachs projects spending will climb by another 17% in 2026. My own forecasts are in line with this view: annual capex of $800 billion by 2030, perhaps 60% in the US, which would bring the American share to 1.6% of 2025 GDP. The economic-strain gauge has three segments: green up to 1%, amber up to 2% and red above 2%. So today, genAI sits in the green zone – just. Of course, given stated commitments, it looks like it’ll head into amber soon. But there is a twist here that history’s bubbles did not face: rapid depreciation. Once laid, a railway track could last decades. The US was still running freight over 19th-century tracks well into the 20th. Telecom fiber rolled out in the 1990s still carries traffic 35 years later. GPUs, by contrast, age in dog years. Their useful life for frontier applications such as model training is perhaps three years, after which they are relegated to lower-intensity tasks. Roughly a third of hyperscaler capex is going into such short-lived assets. They remain, in theory, monetizable in years five and six. The rest goes into shells, power and cooling that last two or three decades. Adjusting for asset life makes the AI build-out look even more demanding: unlike railroads or fiber, the system must earn its keep in a handful of years, not generations. Whether this dynamic makes financial conditions worse or better is an open question. The pessimistic view is that a box of ripe bananas is worth less than the same value of Brazil nuts, because it must be consumed quickly. But the optimistic case is intriguing: shorter depreciation cycles may impose financial discipline on incoming investors. During the railway mania, decades-long asset lives masked the weakness of many business models; companies could stagger on for years before insolvency. In AI, the flaws may surface quickly, forcing either rapid adaptation or rapid failure. The strain is noticeable but not yet unbearable. Venture funding at the AI application layer, while noisy, remains modest compared with the telecom mania of the 1990s.4 That suggests there may still be running room before the cycle overheats. The trillions pouring into servers, cooling systems and power lines may be essential, but history suggests they are not where the enduring profits accumulate. In railways, many track companies went bust, but the logistics firms and commodity barons riding their lines prospered. In telecoms, it was not the builders of fiber who captured the upside but the platforms and service providers that used the bandwidth. The same logic may apply to AI: hyperscalers shoulder the capex burden, but the durable value may accrue to those who control the models, the data and the ecosystems built on top. This brings us to the second gauge on the dashboard: industry strain. Every boom needs to prove that the money poured into new equipment is starting to earn its keep. In any growth stage, it is unlikely that revenues will cover investment, but they should be non-zero. This gauge looks at the ratio of capex to revenues. We estimate that genAI revenues look on track to exceed $60 billion this year, from roughly nil five years ago.5 This number could well undercount the value being generated by genAI. Meta, for example, has suggested that the technology has increased conversions on its platforms by about 3–5%. Indirect effects like this may help explain why some analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, peg 2025 revenues far higher than our estimate, at $153 billion. The big hyperscalers, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, are without doubt moving into a phase of higher capex intensity. In 2021, before ChatGPT, hyperscalers invested about 44% of their operating cash flow in capex. By 2024, that had risen to 68%. In 2025, it will be higher still. But, as Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research points out, these firms can absorb this shift by replatforming, with structurally higher capital intensity driving growth and efficiency gains. This dynamic has been in place for a decade already: between 2015 and 2018, Microsoft Azure’s capex represented between 70% and 90% of revenues. It was an investment in the future. This makes for an interesting comparison to earlier boom cycles. The railroads are particularly pertinent. The railroads’ direct revenue contribution was tiny compared to the value the railroads created in the US economy. Railway bubbles were always tethered to the reality of cash flow. The bonds issued to finance new track and rolling stock had to be serviced out of passenger fares and freight revenues. Whenever capex outpaced earnings, the strain showed. The manias of 1873, 1883 and 1887 all followed the same pattern: a sharp decline in the ratio of annual revenues to capital spending, and in some cases, outright revenue contraction. At the height of the US railroad expansion in 1872, capex was around two times revenues. In the late-1990s telecom bubble, capex amounted to just under four times revenues. By contrast, today’s genAI boom runs on roughly $60 billion in revenues against about $370 billion in global data center capex – a capex-to-revenue ratio of six times, the most stretched of the three.6 On the industry-strain gauge, railways sat healthily in the green. GenAI is in amber, nearing red. It’s not quite a warning sign, not least because genAI has people clamoring for access to AI data centers. One report suggests that enterprise customers are committing to capacity before data centers are even built. What is driving that is usage, and with that comes astonishing revenue growth. The problem in the railroad and telecom booms was not sector strain per se, but that revenues ran out of momentum. Investment expects a return. After the railway bubble burst in 1873, revenue declined by 3% year over year. Telecoms did slightly better, declining 0.5%. Before the crashes, revenue growth was hardly explosive. Railways in 1873 expanded 22% – enough to double in three years. Telecom in the late 1990s managed only 16%, a doubling time of just over four years. By contrast, genAI revenues are still accelerating. By our estimates, genAI revenues will grow about twofold this year.7 And this is likely a conservative forecast. Citi estimates that model makers’ revenue will grow 483% in 2025. OpenAI forecasts annualized growth of about 73% to 2030, while analysts like Morgan Stanley estimate this market could be as large as $1 trillion by 2028, equivalent to compound growth of ~122% a year over the period. Our revenue growth gauge is an exponential one. It measures revenue doubling time in years; that is, at current growth rates, how long does it take for sector revenue to double? Here, genAI sits squarely in the green, doubling every year. Much of this spending flows down to the hyperscalers and neoclouds that run the infrastructure. Hyperscalers make tons of money, so they can afford to invest, trimming a few points off earnings if they think it positions them well for the future. Oracle projects that its cloud business could generate around $380 billion in cumulative revenues by 2030. In my conversations with large companies, I get the strong sense that they can’t get enough of this technology right now. And this likely supports the strong growth rates. IBM’s CEO survey shows that genAI is already expanding IT budgets, with 62% of respondents indicating they will increase their AI investments in 2025. Demand is so high that new data centers are at full utilization as soon as they come online, with Amazon CEO Andy Jassy noting that “as fast as we put the capacity in, it’s being consumed” and Sam Altman remarking that a lack of compute was affecting model upgrades. Jensen Huang expected this would happen early in 2024, predicting that demand for both Hopper and Blackwell chips would outstrip supply well into next year. Some 9% of US firms have one useful genAI use case. Back-of-the-napkin math suggests that 9% will become 75% within five years, and the number of use cases will rise from one to hundreds.8 That on its own points to a thousandfold increase in something. I say *something* because the current billing-by-token model may change.9 Even if it doesn’t, we’ll see dramatic price declines on per-token pricing, likely by orders of magnitude. The underlying point is that we are still at the foothills of enterprise use. For now, firms can barely secure enough tokens to meet their needs. The consumer side tells a parallel story. US consumers already spend about $1.4 trillion a year online. This could plausibly double to $3 trillion by 2030 if it grows at 15–17% a year (it has grown at more than 14% a year since 2013). Against this backdrop, a genAI app sector rising from today’s $10 billion to $500 billion within five years looks less far-fetched. Exponential growth rates of 300-500% are already visible in mid-sized startups and the large model providers (see last week’s essay on OpenAI’s valuation), suggesting that even a small reallocation of consumer digital spending could drive revenues into the hundreds of billions. Taken together, these signals point to an industry still in strong ascent, unlike the relatively meager revenue growth that preceded the railroad and telecom busts. If genAI revenues were to grow at even half the pace of last year, then, on my conservative forecast, they would reach $100 billion by 2026, covering about 25% of that year’s capex. If economic and industry strain show the weight of the boom and revenue growth its trajectory, valuation heat is the mood of the market. This is often where bubbles reveal themselves most clearly: how exuberantly investors are pricing the sector, regardless of fundamentals. As Carlota Perez has argued for decades, financial markets tend to overshoot in the early “installation phase” of each technological revolution, pouring in capital far beyond what near-term revenues justify. The frenzy looks irrational in the moment, but it is the mechanism by which society lays down the new infrastructure. The challenge is whether the frenzy can evolve into the “deployment phase,” when the infrastructure becomes universal and delivers real productivity gains. The dot-com bubble is the archetype. Companies with no profits at all floated at triple-digit multiples, some raising more on IPO day than they would ever earn in revenues. Boo.com raised $135 million from investors, including LVMH’s Bernard Arnault, and pitched itself as the “Amazon of fashion.” The site launched in 18 countries with localized language and shipping, with a virtual avatar, “Miss Boo,” who gave shopping tips on 3D models. It spent $25 million on advertising before launch, ballooned staff from 40 to 400, and opened plush offices across New York and Europe. The JavaScript- and Flash-heavy website was nearly unusable on dial-up connections, incompatible with Mac computers and buggy. One in four attempted purchases failed. Despite the extravagance – lavish parties, Concorde flights and celebrity stylists for Miss Boo – polls showed that just 13% of internet users knew the brand existed. Within 18 months, the money was gone. Boo.com collapsed in May 2000.10 What’s going on in genAI does not compare to this. The key measure here is the price/earnings ratio (P/E), a shorthand for how many years of current profits an investor is effectively paying for. If a company has $1 in annual earnings and trades at a P/E of 20, buyers are paying $20 for each dollar of current profit, assuming growth will make that worthwhile. A high P/E means companies are betting on rapid future growth, but too high, for too long, investors might be buying into a fantasy. This was the case in the dot-com era. At the peak, the Nasdaq traded at a P/E of about 72. One detailed study estimated that internet stocks alone carried an implied P/E of 605. In other words, investors were willing to pay for more than six centuries of current earnings. The issue wasn’t that demand disappeared – Amazon’s revenues grew from $2.76 billion in 2000 to $3.12 billion in 2001 – but that no company could grow fast enough to justify those sky-high expectations. The fundamentals improved, but expectations collapsed. Today, the picture is much calmer. The Nasdaq P/E is about 32, half that of the dot-com era. The broader tech market is higher than the long-run average, but nowhere near dot-com territory. Compared to the railroad bubbles, which had an estimated P/E of around 20, it is high. But the railroads ended badly, not because valuations were extreme in themselves, but because revenue growth faltered. By contrast, genAI revenues are still accelerating rapidly. Another indicator of valuation excess that many investors pay attention to is the so-called “Buffett Indicator”, which measures how far ahead of GDP equity market valuations have risen. There is no doubt that this indicator is peaky, well above a two-standard-deviation anomaly that often presages market corrections. We are more sanguine, for the moment. History rhymes; it doesn’t repeat. The Buffett indicator relies on GDP, and GDP is famously bad at capturing technological productivity gains. In addition, a large portion of big tech revenues comes from outside the US, decoupling their earnings from domestic GDP. Finally, AI-based productivity may affect margins – keeping output (and GDP constant), while increasing corporate profits. So while we keep an eye on the Buffett indicator (and its distant cousin, the Shiller CAPE ratio), we feel the different dynamics of an accelerating digital economy are not well captured by them. So how hot is this gauge? My verdict is green. Prices haven’t yet broken free of gravity in the way dot-com valuations did. Funding quality is not a standard metric but a composite judgment. It asks who the money is coming from, how it is structured and whether the capital is willing to wait years for returns or rather chase quarterly pops. Low-quality capital, in short, is short-termist, undisciplined and debt-laden; it rushes and flees quickly. High-quality capital is more patient, better underwritten, and able to withstand volatility. Every bubble has its signature weakness, invariably rooted in how it was financed. Railways were fueled by speculative retail investors with little capital behind them. By the early 1870s, funded debt averaged 46% of total assets among American railroads; when overbuilding met a credit squeeze, financing evaporated. The Panic of 1873 sent rail lines into receivership. Dot-com firms, a century later, were a little sturdier. Venture capital was a boutique business in 1995, with only $5.3 billion deployed. By 2001, more than $237 billion had been poured into startups, often by new and inexperienced managers. The frenzy spilled into public markets: IPO volume between 1999 and 2000 ran six times above historical averages. Companies went public with little revenue. Two of my friends took theGlobe.com public in 1998 and enjoyed a 606% share-price pop the day they went public. Telecoms in the late 1990s leaned on mountains of cheap debt. US and European carriers doubled and quadrupled their leverage in just a few years. Deutsche Telekom and France Télécom together added $78 billion in net debt between 1998 and 2001. When revenues failed to keep pace, defaults rippled through the sector. In each case, the capital that fueled the boom proved ephemeral. But the degree of fragility differed. Railways and telecoms were most exposed to credit crunches, with debt ratios ballooning. Dot-coms were hostage to market mood, with equity values evaporating. On this front, today’s AI boom looks sturdier. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Nvidia are minting extraordinary cash flows, easily enough to bankroll their own build-out. For now. But investment needs are racing ahead. Morgan Stanley reckons total global data center capex will hit $2.9 trillion between 2025 and 2028. Hyperscalers can cover perhaps half of that from internal cash. The rest must come from private credit, securitized finance and new operators. Governments have also pledged $1.6 trillion in sovereign AI investments, and Gulf capital is seeking new opportunities. Here is where the risks creep in. Morgan Stanley itself points to a $1.5 trillion gap that will need to be plugged by debt markets and asset-backed securities. The sums are enormous: $800 billion from private credit, $150 billion in data center ABS,11 and hundreds of billions more in OEM loans and vendor financing.12 That $150 billion alone would triple the size of the data-center securitized markets almost overnight. And not every borrower looks like Microsoft. Consider CoreWeave, an Nvidia-backed upstart now going public with $8 billion of debt. It has already slipped into technical default on loans, missing covenants without being insolvent, and its revenues depend on just two customers. Its economics rest on renting GPUs that depreciate by 20–30% per year, more like a WeWork lease than a hyperscaler’s durable balance sheet. In other words, the foundation is stronger than in past bubbles, but the superstructure is starting to resemble the old pattern. Esoteric debt structures, concentrated counterparties and hardware that may not hold value are reappearing. If genAI revenues grow tenfold, creditors will be fine. If not, they may discover that a warehouse full of obsolete GPUs is a difficult thing to secure. For now, my gauge is greenish. We’re not yet in bubble territory, but if financing keeps creeping this way over the next year without revenue growth as robust as 2025’s, it might tick over to amber. On the basis of these gauges, genAI remains in a demand-led, capital-intensive boom rather than a bubble. But booms can sour quickly, and there are several pressure points worth watching: If investment climbs toward 2% of GDP, it could suggest the economy is overweighting AI relative to its productivity returns; equally, if one or more hyperscalers were to cut capex by more than a fifth over the next three to five years, that would mark a sharp turn in sentiment that could trigger a rapid decline among other players. A sustained fall in current enterprise and consumer spending levels would be another warning, especially if foreshadowed by a shrinking Nvidia order backlog. At the same time, the economics need to improve: revenues per dollar of capital should move toward the 0.5–1.0 range. Should the gap fail to close, it would imply that scale is not delivering the expected efficiencies. If valuations start approaching a P/E ratio of 50-60, it would look frothy, since a genuine growth phase should see earnings catching up with prices, not lagging further behind. If internal cash covers less than 25% of capex, data center investment stability comes under pressure. Right now, stability comes from hyperscalers’ strong cash flows. If they stop covering the majority of capex, then more debt and securitization will creep in. Not great given a GPU’s depreciation cycle. If internal funding slips below a quarter of new capex and reliance shifts toward debt and securitization, the sector’s dependence on short-lived GPUs and its exposure to higher interest rates could quickly become destabilizing. My current heuristic is that if two of the five gauges head into red, you’re in bubble territory. Time to sell up, buy the VIX and take some deep breaths. In the year prior to the Panic of 1873, the railroad’s economic strain turned red, accompanied by a decline in funding quality. Anemic revenue growth didn’t help. With the telecoms crash of 2001, revenue growth and funding quality blared red. In the dot-com era, it was industry investment strain and valuations. GenAI isn’t there yet. Racing fast, the engine is whining, but not overheating. How long would it take for two gauges to get into the red? I’ve toyed around with combinations, and most scary scenarios take a couple of years to play out. (And not all scenarios are scary.) That said, so many macro factors, from a recession in the US, to rising inflation, a challenging interest-rate environment, and domestic or international politics, could dampen spirits. While we might not be solidly in bubbleland, it would be hubristic to assume the AI investment cycle is immune to those exuberant dynamics. Onward. For now. Share I even wrote a blurb on the 1999 book The Internet Bubble. Edward Chancellor’s book on bubbles is a useful guide. Last year, SemiAnalysis forecast that around 70% of data center capacity build-out will happen in the US over the medium term. Adjusted for inflation, VC investment in the internet in 2000 was $85.9 billion; Dealroom.co reports $47 billion for the AI application layer last year – a difference of $38.9 billion. Revenues are compiled from primary corporate disclosures (SEC filings, earnings transcripts, investor presentations, press releases) and supplemented by analyst and consultancy estimates (McKinsey, Gartner, IDC, etc.) where company reporting is incomplete. We prioritize disclosed figures, adjust for potential double-counting in revenue-sharing agreements (e.g., OpenAI–Microsoft), and categorize revenue streams (subscription, API, infrastructure, licensing) to maintain comparability. Private-company revenues (e.g., Anthropic, Midjourney) rely on reported run-rates or credible press/VC sources, flagged as estimates. See previous footnote for genAI revenue model. Railroads calculated from FRED data and telecoms from OECD data on US leased line revenues. Our model shows 130% growth among AI companies year over year. Starting from about six million US firms, assume 9% (about 540,000) now have one useful genAI use case; project adoption to 75% (about 4.5 million) within five years, and average use cases per adopting firm to rise from about 1 to about 100 – yielding roughly 450 million use cases, an increase of about 830 times; illustrative, not a forecast. Most genAI services today are billed “by the token.” A token is a unit of text, usually about four characters or ¾ of a word. Customers are charged for tokens processed in prompts and responses (for example, a 1,000-word output might equal ~1,300 tokens). This model directly links cost to usage, but it may evolve as enterprises negotiate flat-rate contracts, consumption bundles, or outcome-based pricing. I spent an afternoon walking through Boo’s deserted offices after the collapse to see if any physical assets retained value. Asset-backed securities are bonds sold to investors, backed by cash flows from a pool of underlying assets. In this case, the assets are data center leases or infrastructure contracts, allowing operators to raise capital by securitizing predictable rental or service revenues. OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) such as Dell, Cisco or Nvidia often extend credit to customers or partner with financing arms to help them buy hardware. Vendor financing is the broader term for suppliers lending to buyers, typically repaid out of the revenues generated from using the purchased equipment. First of all, thanks for the reference to my work in your thoughtful, balanced and all but comprehensive analysis. There is one further aspect of these transformational technologies that are deployed as network-based services. This is the pricing dynamics when (a) the ability to deliver the first unit of service requires very large capital investment and (2) the marginal cost of delivering incremental units of services is very low. Then, marginal cost will be below average cost and – under competitive conditions – price will tend to be driven towards marginal cost. The result, of course, is negative cash flow for all competitors which, in turn, incentivizes some mix of regulatory intervention to protect the competitors from each other (ICC, PUCs) and evolution towards oligopoly/monopoly. I gather that inklings of these dynamics can be seen in the decline of cost/price per token. I am very interested in your take on this issue when it comes to roll out of the foundational models at increasing scale. -- Bill Janeway You certainly are right to mobilize demand elasticity as the counter MC<AC. But token cost is not the full cost of AI deployment. Given the probabilistic nature of the LLM token-prediction process, applications will vary by the intensity of the need for human supervision, debugging, etc. I don’t know how representative this RCT was, but it did strike me as suggesting a somewhat more complicated scenario: https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/ .

Title: Stocks Over Spot: The Case For Buying Bitcoin Treasury Companies Instead Of BTC
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/the-case-for-buying-bitcoin-treasury/
Time Published: 2025-09-21T00:00:34Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin is among the world’s most important assets, but owning it directly is not the only way to get exposure. A growing number of public companies hold massive amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. For investors buying these stocks, it can sometimes offer even greater upside than holding BTC itself. In a thought-provoking post on X, Adam Livingston, author of the Bitcoin Age and the Great Harvest, offers a compelling argument for why investors should consider buying the stock of Bitcoin treasury companies, rather than just BTC itself. His perspective goes beyond a simple leveraged play and speaks to a long-term vision of a new financial infrastructure built on a BTC foundation. Livingston’s thesis is that a new paradigm-shifting financial infrastructure built over the coming years will take Bitcoin to $100-200 trillion BTC market, supporting an equal magnitude of Bitcoin-denominated credit and equity. This new infrastructure would enable global transactions at light speed on open ledgers, providing everyone with a censorship-resistant, inflation-proof yield stream. The key takeaway from the recent unconference is that this infrastructure needs to be built because it is where solving complex issues, such as custody, compliance, and distribution across different jurisdictions, comes into play. It also involves creating products that cater to traditional investors who may not want or need a volatile, infinite-duration asset like Bitcoin itself. Thus, these products can strip away volatility, manage duration, or FX risk, allowing institutions and individuals to gain the spread and recycle profits back into BTC collateral. However, Livingston argues that Bitcoin can enable the exact instruments they do want. If BTC is to reach $1,000,000, it will require a robust financial infrastructure to funnel global capital into the asset. Crypto analyst Rajatsonfinance has highlighted a contrarian perspective on Bitcoin investing, urging people to abandon the common strategy of waiting for a bear market to start buying. Instead, he advocates for a more proactive approach centered on value creation and consistent accumulation. According to Rajatsonfinance, trying to time the market is a flawed and often unsuccessful endeavor. He argues that waiting for a crash could be used to build skills and create value in the real world. His primary advice is to focus on earning more money and then exchanging that income for Bitcoin, whether by selling services for dollars and converting them or by accepting BTC directly as payment. The analyst emphasized that if executed with a solid idea, passion, and consistent effort, it can lead to a far more significant BTC stack than one could ever accumulate by trying to buy the dip. He suggests that a successful business or a well-executed side hustle has the potential to generate far more than a modest $10,000 to $15,000, which would result in a holding far exceeding 0.1 BTC.

September 20, 2025 19:33 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: American labor has a new challenge: Trump’s $100K fee on H-1B visas | CNN Business
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/20/business/h-1b-fee-trump-immigration-workers
Time Published: 2025-09-20T22:06:12Z
Full Content:
Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks President Donald Trump’s latest effort to overhaul America’s legal immigration system — raising the annual fee on H-1B visa applicants from $215 to $100,000 — could deal a major blow to some US industries that rely on skilled foreign workers. During a signing at the Oval Office Friday, Trump argued that America needs “great workers” and that the newly imposed fee “pretty much ensures that that’s what’s going to happen.” Administration officials also claimed the hefty fee would incentivize companies to hire American workers. “The company needs to decide … is the person valuable enough to have a $100,000-a-year payment to the government, or they should head home and go hire an American?” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the signing. “That’s the point of immigration: Hire Americans and make sure the people coming in are the top, top people.” Of the 85,000 H-1B visas granted annually, another 20,000 are reserved for people with advanced degrees from American higher education institutions. But Trump’s allies have been divided on how to tackle the visa program. Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk, whom Trump chose to lead the administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, have defended companies that use the work visa and depend on foreign workers to operate. Steve Bannon, a top strategist in Trump’s first term, blasted H-1B visas on his “War Room” podcast in December 2024 as a “scam” by Silicon Valley titans, who are about “taking American jobs and bringing over what essentially become indentured servants at lower wages.” Here’s what the new policy means for businesses and workers. The $100,000 visa fee, which takes effect Sunday at 12:01 a.m. ET, will apply only to new H-1B applications, according to the White House. The rule expires a year later, on September 21, 2026, unless it’s extended. “This is NOT an annual fee. It’s a one-time fee that applies only to the petition,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted to X on Saturday, adding that it does not apply to renewals or current visa holders. Google and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, advised visa holders to reconsider international travel plans and to consider returns to the United States by Saturday night, if necessary, according to emails viewed by CNN. But Leavitt clarified Saturday afternoon that any current H-1B holders who are outside the United States will not be charged $100,000 to reenter. Most H-1B petitions approved during fiscal 2024 — which spanned from October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024 — were for computer-related roles (64%), according to a US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) report. The next largest occupation was in the field of architecture, engineering and surveying (10%). The third-most-approved petitions were for education-related jobs (6%), according to USCIS. The “largest detailed industry sector” for approved H-1B visas was related to custom computer programming (25%). Professional, scientific and technical services was the No. 1 industry among employers (48%), while manufacturing (11%) was the second-most popular. According to the USCIS data hub, Amazon is the largest H-1B sponsor. The online retailing giant was approved for more than 9,000 H-1B visas during fiscal 2024. Tech giants also rely on the H-1B program, with Google sponsoring 5,364 approved H-1B visas in fiscal 2024, followed by Meta (4,844), Microsoft (4,725) and Apple (3,873). Small businesses and startups are more likely to balk at that $100,000 fee than companies like Amazon, Meta, Apple and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. The four companies have a combined capitalization of about $11.1 trillion. The fee could also mean foreign-born workers would be denied entry-level positions, as the $100,000 cost would be too much of a burden to pay for a lower-waged worker. Recent college graduates, who are experiencing the worst market for new grads since the Covid-19 pandemic, could stand to gain from job openings if the openings remain in America. That’s particularly good news for computer science and tech-related graduates, who are entering the market amid rounds of layoffs and plummeting opportunities. During his 2016 campaign, Trump accused US companies of using H-1B visas “for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay.” But the USCIS reported that, of approved H-1B petitions, the median annual compensation was $120,000. Companies will likely continue to offer higher-paying salaries to the best talent pool of foreign workers. But restrictions could make companies shift hiring initiatives abroad to countries like India, China and Canada, according to the American Immigration Council. Placing limits on H-1B holders doesn’t guarantee Americans will be hired in the impacted sectors. When immigration slowed during the pandemic and following the first Trump administration’s temporary ban on some immigrant visas, it led to record-high job openings. Economists warned at the time that the worker shortage couldn’t be solved without ramping up immigration. “Businesses are having to turn down work because they simply can’t find the workers to do it,” Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce, told CNN in 2021. The new fee on visas is likely to be challenged in US courts. “To be clear, the president has literally zero legal authority to impose a $100,000 fee on visas,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, on X. “The only authority Congress has ever given the executive branch here is to charge fees to recover the cost of processing the application.” CNN’s Alejandra Jaramillo, Adam Cancryn, Matt Egan and Yong Xiong contributed to this report.

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. The crypto market is entering one of its most exciting phases yet, and presales are at the heart of this momentum. While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate headlines, the real upside often comes from presales that combine utility, community growth, and visionary roadmaps. Among the flood of projects vying for attention, a few stand out for their strong numbers and ambitious goals. BlockDAG, in particular, is rewriting the rules of what a presale can achieve, while others, such as BlockchainFX, JetBolt, and Little Pepe, are building strong momentum. Below, we break down why these coins are generating hype and why BlockDAG is emerging as the clear frontrunner. BlockDAG is proving to be one of the most explosive presales the crypto market has seen in years. With nearly $410 million already raised and more than 26.3 billion BlockDAG coins sold, this project is racing toward its ambitious $600 million goal at record speed. Right now, the coin sits at just $0.0013 in Batch 30, but this golden entry point won’t be around for long as it ends in the next 24 hours. Once it hits its confirmed listing price of $0.05, current holders are guaranteed a 3,746% ROI from day one of trading. But the hype isn’t just numbers on paper. BlockDAG already has 312,000+ holders, has started shipping over 19,900 ASIC miners worldwide, and is powering a massive base of 3 million X1 mobile miners actively running every day. Add in the soon-to-launch Awakening Testnet, which will showcase its technology in real time, and it’s clear this project has execution, not just promises. BlockchainFX has already raised $7.24 million from more than 9,000 participants, making it one of the most promising best crypto presale contenders in the fintech app sector. At a token price of $0.023, early holders are securing a steep discount before its official $0.05 launch price. What sets BFX apart is its “super app” positioning: it connects crypto, stocks, forex, and commodities in a single trading ecosystem. With a beta app already live and presale bonuses, including a 30% token boost for early holders, BlockchainFX is gaining strong momentum. JetBolt is another project generating hype as a fresh best crypto presale option. Built on the SKALE network, it offers zero gas fees, AI-powered utilities, staking rewards, and scalable smart contracts. However, details around tokenomics and pricing remain scarce. While the buzz is strong, JetBolt is still in a very early stage, meaning the upside could be significant if execution follows through, but so could the risks. Little Pepe has taken the meme coin space by storm, raising over $25 million in presale funds. Now priced at $0.0021 in Stage 12, the project has already sold out over 15 billion tokens across earlier rounds. Unlike many meme tokens, LILPEPE runs on its own Ethereum-compatible Layer-2, featuring near-instant transactions, zero trading tax, and anti-sniper bot protection. With additional incentives like mega giveaways and staking rewards, analysts project this presale could deliver 25× returns post-listing, making it another hot contender for the best crypto presale list. The search for the best crypto presale of 2025 is heating up, and holders have no shortage of options. BlockchainFX is building a multi-asset super app, JetBolt promises next-gen scalability, and Little Pepe combines meme power with serious Layer-2 utility. Each has potential, but none match the scale, adoption, and guaranteed ROI of BlockDAG. With nearly $410 million raised, a $0.0013 entry price, and a locked-in 3,746% ROI at launch, BlockDAG is emerging as the best crypto presale opportunity. BlockDAG’s real-world adoption: 312,000+ holders, 19,900 ASIC miners being shipped, and 3 million X1 app users, shows momentum that most projects never achieve. In 2025, the winners will be the buyers who recognized early that BlockDAG was not just another presale, but a game-changing crypto revolution.

Join thousands of innovation leaders getting weekly insights Why James Mackintosh's defense of quarterly reporting ignores what actually happens in corporate boardrooms. James Mackintosh's recent Wall Street Journal piece defending quarterly earnings reporting reads like a textbook example of why academic analysis often misses the mark when it comes to understanding corporate behavior. As someone who lived this reality for years as Chief Technology Officer at Hewlett-Packard—the world's largest technology company at the time by revenue with massive R&D investments—I can tell you the quarterly reporting system creates perverse incentives that systematically undermine long-term innovation. Mackintosh's central argument rests on flawed premises and cherry-picked data that ignore the lived experience of corporate executives who actually make investment decisions under quarterly pressure. His dismissal misses a critical opportunity to address one of America's most significant competitive disadvantages. Let me share what quarterly reporting actually looks like from the inside. During my tenure as CTO at HP, I experienced how quarterly pressure created systematic patterns across the industry where R&D would be paused, or delayed during quarter-end periods. This became a predictable cycle that repeated quarter after quarter. This behavior wasn’t unique to HP. It's the inevitable result of a system that rewards short-term financial engineering over patient capital investment. When your stock price can swing dramatically based on missing earnings by a few cents per share, the rational response is to optimize for quarterly performance, even at the expense of long-term competitiveness. The academic research Mackintosh cites, including MIT's Robert Pozen's study of UK reporting changes, fundamentally misunderstands how corporate behavior evolves. These researchers have never sat in a boardroom where directors debate whether to continue funding a multi-year innovation project that won't generate revenue for 36 months while facing pressure to meet next quarter's numbers. They've never experienced the intense scrutiny from analysts who penalize any hint of reduced short-term profitability. Through my relationship with Alex Mandl—my former boss at Teligent who led the board negotiations to take Dell private—I witnessed the most compelling modern example. Michael Dell and Silver Lake paid $24.9 billion for one thing—freedom from the quarterly earnings pressure that was killing Dell Technologies long-term potential. Dell explicitly stated the goal was "no more pulling R&D and growth investments to make in-quarter numbers." R&D spending increased from $1.1 billion to $4.4 billion, transforming Dell from declining PC manufacturer to enterprise solutions leader. The result: an estimated $70 billion return by 2023. This wasn't theoretical—it was a $25 billion bet that quarterly reporting pressure was destroying long-term value. And they were proven spectacularly right. Mackintosh's reliance on the UK's 2014 experience with optional quarterly reporting reveals a critical flaw in his reasoning. He argues that because UK companies didn't dramatically change their investment behavior after switching to semi-annual reporting, quarterly reporting must not be problematic. This ignores a fundamental truth: we've trained an entire generation of CEOs, CFOs, and board members to think in 90-day cycles. You don't undo decades of conditioning overnight. When business schools teach earnings management, when compensation systems reward quarterly performance, and when analysts' careers depend on predicting short-term results, making reporting optional doesn't suddenly transform corporate culture. The UK comparison is meaningless without addressing the broader ecosystem that reinforces short-term thinking. Mackintosh points to Big Tech's massive AI investments as proof that quarterly reporting doesn't hinder long-term thinking. This argument reveals a profound misunderstanding of competitive dynamics. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta can hide enormous R&D expenditures within their massive profit margins. When you're generating 20-30% operating margins on hundreds of billions in revenue, you can afford to invest $50 billion in speculative technologies while still meeting quarterly expectations. But what about companies in lower-margin industries? What about manufacturing firms, healthcare companies, or emerging technology businesses that can't disguise innovation investments as easily? The current system creates a two-tier economy where only the most profitable companies can afford to think long-term, while everyone else gets trapped in quarterly optimization cycles. America's competitive advantage has always been rooted in our ability to make patient, long-term investments in breakthrough technologies. The semiconductor industry, the internet, biotechnology, and countless other innovations emerged from companies willing to invest for decades before seeing returns. Today's quarterly reporting regime systematically discourages this kind of "patient innovation." I've written extensively about the concept of the "50-year overnight success"—the reality that truly transformative innovations require sustained investment over multiple decades. Companies need the freedom to pursue breakthrough technologies without explaining every quarter why they're spending money on projects that won't generate revenue for years. Do I think switching from quarterly to semi-annual reporting solves the problem? No. Six months isn't meaningfully different from three months when it comes to long-term thinking. But we can make meaningful reforms that would help: First, eliminate forward-looking earnings guidance. This practice forces companies to make public commitments about future performance, creating enormous pressure to meet those predictions regardless of changing circumstances. Second, create accounting treatments that allow companies to separate long-term innovation investments from operational expenses, giving investors clearer visibility into both current performance and future potential. Third, develop new metrics and incentives that reward patient capital deployment and long-term value creation, not just quarterly financial performance. This isn't an abstract policy debate—it's about America's economic future. While we optimize for quarterly performance, competitors in China and other nations are making massive, sustained investments in critical technologies. Their state-directed approach has significant flaws, as Mackintosh correctly notes, but at least they're thinking in decade-long time horizons. We need American companies to have the same freedom to pursue patient innovation without facing quarterly punishment from investors and analysts who fundamentally misunderstand the innovation process. Academic researchers and financial journalists can theorize all they want about efficient markets and rational behavior. Those of us who've actually run large corporations know better. The quarterly reporting system is broken, and defending it based on theoretical models and incomplete data serves no one except those who profit from short-term volatility. Next time the Wall Street Journal wants to analyze corporate behavior, perhaps they should talk to someone who's actually lived it. The American economy deserves better than academic theory masquerading as practical wisdom.

Compare this to a single stock – Oracle Corporation adding $255 billion to its market cap within few hours on September 10! The message from investors is clear: The AI mania is running up and strong. The software giant grabbed headlines when its shares gained 36 per cent on September 10. With this massive move up, the stock added over $255 billion to its market cap – joining the exclusive club of stocks that have gained $250 billion or more in a single day. Other members of the coveted club are Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft. What triggered this euphoria in Oracle shares? The company had reported results for Q1 FY26 on September 9 after market close. However, it wasn’t earnings that pleased the street. While its net profit came in line with expectations, revenue reported a slight miss. What, in fact, surprised the street was the company’s grand plans for scaling up its cloud infrastructure business, a whopping 14 times by FY30 – from $10.2 billion in revenue in FY25 to $144 billion. In other words, this is a compounded growth rate of 70 per cent between FY25 and FY30. As the AI race continues full steam, it appears Oracle doesn’t want to be left behind. With large language models (LLMs) being built and upgraded left, right and centre, there is heavy demand for data centres that have the compute (processing power) to support this. This is exactly where Oracle and its cloud infrastructure business come in. The company offers cloud-based compute, storage and networking services to clients. Simply put, clients can make use of Oracle’s high-performance cloud servers to deploy applications based on AI. During the said quarter, the company signed multiple multi-year, multi-billion-dollar contracts (largely under the cloud infrastructure vertical), taking the RPO (remaining performance obligations) figure to $455 billion, which is all the more the main reason for the rally. Readers can understand RPO as order backlog for now. This is a rise of 359 per cent year on year and 230 per cent quarter on quarter. RPO is further expected to reach $500 billion in the next few months. For context, Oracle’s FY25 revenue was $57.4 billion. Though the company is making the right moves to make the most of AI-led demand, there are a few factors that are noteworthy here. First, RPOs represent contracted revenue that is yet to be recognised. Revenue can be recognised only if Oracle could discharge its contractual obligations when the time comes. Thus the $455-billion RPO is not an absolute guarantee that it would translate to future revenue. Contract cancellations and unfavourable modifications to the contract terms could result in material write-down of RPOs. Second, Wall Street Journal reported that Oracle has struck a $300-billion deal with OpenAI, likely spanning over five years from 2027. Now, looking at this in tandem with the $455-billion RPO figure, it leads one to believe that much of the future revenue is tied to one single client – giving room for concentration risk. What is even more concerning is the fact that OpenAI is a cash-burning start-up, run on venture capital, with about $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, per media reports. Third, while the company appears to have a robust road-map for the cloud infrastructure business, there isn’t relatively as much clarity as to the future of the rest of the businesses. Currently, the cloud infrastructure business accounts for just 17 per cent of overall revenue based on FY25. In the last five quarters, this vertical has clocked year-on-year constant currency revenue growth of 51 per cent on average. This, while the rest of the verticals have grown at a mere 2.5 per cent. While such concerns linger, the market’s reaction appears premature and running ahead of fundamentals. Even in the last five years, the company’s execution record has not been strong relative to its stock price performance. On an absolute basis, while earnings have grown 23 per cent on an absolute basis over that of FY20, stock price during the same period has risen close to 400 per cent. Even before the 36 per cent jump last week, the stock was trading at a trailing PE of 54x, which is not inexpensive. As of September 19, it trades at a PE of 69x. All things considered, this very simply reflects investors’ euphoric bet on anything linked to AI. But is it turning into a bubble, one that is reminiscent of the dotcom bust? Before addressing the pertinent question, investors first need to understand the sheer size of economic interest involved in the ongoing AI race. Here’s some crazy statistic. Since January 2020, the market cap of the S&P 500 index has risen $31 trillion. On another hand, the top 10 AI stocks, that are part of the index, have added $18 trillion to their combined market cap. These include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, Oracle, Broadcom and Palantir. This is saying, the worth of just 2 per cent of the index’s stocks have grown equivalent to 60 per cent of the index’s gains, while the rest 98 per cent got the short end of the stick (40 per cent). Also, currently, the market cap of these stocks put together is as large as 40 per cent of S&P 500’s market cap. Further, the current AI surge demands unprecedented capital expenditure, as companies compete to build the computational infrastructure. These include real estate for data centres, the cutting-edge GPUs and related cooling systems and network hardware. In the past few years, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Oracle (in descending order of quantum of capex; referred to as Big 5 in this article) have been large spenders on capex. Together, the Big 5 have invested an aggregate of $586 billion over the last three fiscals. They are expected to incur about $860 billion in the next two years. This is almost as big as how much the US spends on defence every year. Historically, the Big 5 have been asset-light businesses. However, with capex picking up lately, their combined fixed assets turnover ratio (only tangible assets considered) has gradually declined year on year to almost half of what it was 10 years ago — from 4.6 times to 2.2 times now. To put it in perspective, if one were to assign the multiple of 4.6x to the capex expected to be incurred in 2025 – about $400 billion (see chart), the expectation is that there should be an incremental revenue of $1,850 billion. However, the combined revenue of the Big 5 in the recently-concluded fiscal was only about $1,500 billion and it has taken decades since these companies were incorporated to reach such a scale. Even at the lower end of the multiple – at 2.2 times, incremental revenue required out of the capex would work out to $880 billion by end of FY25. For context, the combined revenue of the cloud verticals of the Big 5 is just about $250 billion today. Even if one were to assume that incremental revenue will kick in with a lag, the argument does come across as a hard sell, especially with these figures. Another statistic that brings out how big the AI capex has become for the economy is the one from the US’ Bureau of Economic Analysis. It measures the contribution of segments of the economy to the overall GDP every quarter. For example, if the GDP growth (real) rate during the quarter is 3 per cent and the contribution of personal consumption expenditure (PCE) reads 1 per cent, then it means that PCE has contributed to a third of incremental GDP. Similarly, for the recently-concluded quarter (Q2 2025), GDP growth was 3.3 per cent, but contribution of gross private domestic investment came in at -2.7 per cent. However, contribution of investment in information processing equipment and software (tech capex), which form part of gross private domestic investment, stood at 0.8 per cent. This shows that despite a slowdown in the overall private capex in the economy, tech capex has stood resilient. For lack of further detailed classification, information processing equipment and software have been considered here, which can be safely assumed to be substantially driven by the ongoing AI, data centre capex. If one were to construct a two-quarter moving average line of this contribution to GDP measure, in the recent quarter, the contribution of tech capex to GDP (1.1 per cent) has, in fact, surpassed the contribution of PCE to GDP (0.7 per cent) for the first time, in the quarters analysed since 2022. This is big, especially when you consider the fact that PCE accounts for about 70 per cent of US’ GDP. Considering the above pointers, it is quite clear that the AI mania is now just too big to fail. Whether it is the wealth effect and its consequent positive impact on economic growth or their hard capex driving a good chunk of the economy or the investor sentiment riding upon these companies, it is in the best interest of all stakeholders that expected revenues start flowing in. Looking ahead, AI is still an evolving technology and so, the picture looks murky today. One, there isn’t yet concrete evidence proving efficiency gains from use of AI would be attractive and cost effective enough to drive healthy adoption in enterprises. Two, while LLMs are being trained by spending on bleeding edge GPUs, there are noticeable positive developments with smaller models that wouldn’t require as much compute as LLMs, sometimes possible even without GPUs – raising the question as to what is the right level of capex. Three, today broadly AI is being used in applications such as summarisation, generative media, transcription and others – where the AI models do not appear to stand differentiated from one another. Sure, AI has found use-cases such as support services, pharmaceutical research and so on. However, the single most important application for AI in the next decade – which could be robotics or autonomous driving, for example, are not yet on the horizon when it comes to mass deployment. On considering the above, the valuations of top AI stocks today are not cheap, with all except Nvidia and Amazon trading at PE ratios above five-year averages. Palantir’s market cap is $433 billion, while its revenue is just $2.9 billion. Outside the top 10, stocks like AMD, ARM Holdings trade at PE ratios of 86x and 172x respectively. CoreWeave, a recently-listed cloud services company, is yet to turn profitable but is a $61-billion unit, with revenue and net loss of $1.9 billion and $863 million (FY24). In the unlisted space, AI start-ups are raking in capital from VC/PE funds at lofty valuations. Entities from within the AI value chain have become backers in some cases. Case in point, Microsoft’s, Amazon’s and ASML’s investment in OpenAI, Anthropic and Mistral respectively. All three are cash-burning start-ups valued at about $300 billion, $180 billion and $14 billion respectively (per known latest funding rounds). This exuberance does make one reminiscent of the infamous dotcom bubble of 2000 – when anything that had ‘Internet’ stamped on it was selling like hot cakes, even at unreasonable valuations. Right before the bubble burst in March 2000, the S&P 500 reached a PE ratio of 29.5x – never to see a rerating to such levels until April 2021, which too lasted only briefly. Today, its PE is reasonably close to such levels at 26x. However, the current market cap (of S&P 500) to GDP ratio stands at 2x, much worse than about 1.3x in March 2000. Even on a forward earnings basis, the index and almost all top AI stocks trade at PEG (price to earnings growth) ratios of over 2x, which appear unsustainable, all things considered. Though AI presents a structural opportunity to bet on, investors need to be extremely watchful of valuations as they can make all the difference. Investors will be better served waiting for now, in search of better entry points with higher margin of safety. As the AI craze continues to heat up, it is worth pondering on this quote from John Hussman, a fund manager who was prescient in his prediction of the dot com crash: Valuations often matter suddenly, and with a vengeance. This is a lesson best learnt before a crash rather than after one. In the interest of how much depends on AI investment and wealth effect, one will have to hope this time is truly different!

The advice doing the rounds that Indian investors ought to go big on US stocks to avoid ‘losing money’ from rupee depreciation, is the latest example. Their arguments are on the following lines. # If you’ve earned an 18 per cent CAGR (compound annual growth rate) from your domestic equity funds in the last five years, don’t be too happy. After adjusting for rupee depreciation, your returns are just 13 per cent. The rupee has been losing 3-4 per cent against the US dollar for the last many decades. The only way to shield your portfolio from this is to invest in US markets. # The AI revolution is sweeping the world. As AI replaces humans across industries, many Indian industries will be disrupted. Stay safe by investing in US Magnificent 7 companies. There’s a grain of truth in each of these statements; but it’s no more than a grain. If you’re thinking of making a wholesale switch from Indian stocks to the US ones, look before you leap. Investing a small portion of your portfolio in dollar-denominated assets to fund your overseas expenditure is a good idea. But this is a particularly bad time to replace your Indian equity allocations with US equities, hoping to earn a higher return or gain from dollar appreciation. Let’s first look at why Indian investors need to stick with rupee assets. Buy what you know: Globally, even professional and institutional investors have a home-country bias. That is, they invest the bulk of their portfolio in assets denominated in the currency of their home country. US investors stick by dollar assets and Chinese investors prefer yuan-denominated assets. This is quite simply because you get the best results from investing in what you understand. An Indian investor has a greater shot at understanding and tracking the Indian economy, consumers, companies and government policy, than the US economy, its consumers or government policy. When professional investors or institutions invest outside their home country, they think of this as a risk and hedge against it. USD weakening: It is also dangerous to expect the dollar to deliver 3-4 per cent gains against the rupee like clockwork. Yes, over the last three decades, the rupee has lost ground against the dollar at a 3-4 per cent annualised rate. This is because India has consistently run a current account deficit and needed foreign capital inflows to fund it. But there’s no guarantee that rupee depreciation will continue at this rate to perpetuity. If a shrinking current account deficit, a healthy economy, improving sovereign ratings or attractive stock valuations or bond yields woo back foreign investors to India, this can slow the pace of rupee depreciation. In fact, the dollar index is down 10 per cent since the beginning of 2025, on tariff turbulence and rate cut expectations. US policymakers are, today, keen to allow the dollar to weaken substantially, so that US exports can be made more competitive. Mirror your expenses: The basic purpose of financial planning is to fund your future expenses. If your future expenses such as buying a home or setting up a pension fund are going to be in rupees, your investments need to be rupee-denominated too. Yes, rupee depreciation can indirectly peg up your expenses if imported goods such as crude oil, gold, industrial metals or edible oils get costlier. But all this gets captured in domestic inflation numbers. As long as you plan your investments to beat inflation, the currency impact on your daily expenses is taken care of. You need dollar assets in your portfolio only to the extent of financial goals that will entail spending in dollars. If you plan to tour the US, enrol in a US master’s programme, pursue higher education for your child in American universities, that portion of your portfolio needs to be invested in dollar assets. Switching from Indian stocks to US stocks today, based on valuation concerns, is akin to jumping from the frying pan into the fire. Here’s why. * As the Indian market has enjoyed a breathless bull run since Covid, the US market has rallied right alongside it. In the five years to September 2025, while the Nifty50 has gained 120 per cent, Nasdaq100 Index is up 127 per cent and US S&P 500 112 per cent. Yes, Indian markets have turned expensive after this rally with the Nifty50 at a 22 PE and the Nifty500 at 25. But then so has the US market, which now appears over-valued by most metrics. The Buffett Indicator (market cap to GDP) for the US hovers at 217 per cent against the fair level of 100 per cent. S&P index’ trailing PE of 26 times is well above the long-term average of 18. The forward PE of 25 stacks up against the long-term average of 17. Therefore, if Indian stocks can get derated on earnings disappointments, so can US stocks. * After a post-Covid boom, the Indian economy has normalised to 6.5-7 per cent growth rate. The US economy is, however, on the verge of a sharp slowdown. Last week, US Fed members projected that GDP growth could slow down to 1.6 per cent in 2025 and 1.8 per cent in 2026 from 2.8 per cent in 2024. With government spending cuts, US jobs growth has fallen off a cliff in recent months with monthly non-farm payrolls averaging 29,000 in June-August 2025 against 82,000 same time last year. The impact of these job losses on consumer spending and the economy is yet to play out. It is hard to believe at this juncture that tariff flip-flops, job losses and the spending slowdown that follows will have no impact on US corporate earnings. Whether Fed rate cuts will make up for all this remains to be seen. * Unlike the Indian government, which has been cutting back on borrowings post-Covid, the US has been binge-borrowing, with its debt at $37 trillion and debt-GDP ratio at over 120 per cent now. US bond market yields have been highly volatile in the last one year and are at present above the levels at which they were when the Federal Reserve started cutting rates in September 2024. Rising bond yields ratchet up the cost of borrowings for the US government and companies, and can spook capital flows. Global central banks have been diversifying away from the dollar into gold holdings in recent times. * A popular argument for investing in US equities is that no other market offers the opportunity to own a piece of global hyper-scalers such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia and Amazon. This is true. The Magnificent Seven, thanks to their technological prowess and the global dominance of their platforms, have managed scorching growth rates in revenues, profits and cash flows over the past decade. In recent years, they have invested eye-watering sums in AI capex, building up hopes that rising AI adoption will drive the next leg of supernormal growth for these companies. It is thanks to these expectations that the market capitalisation of Magnificent 7 stocks has rocketed to $21 trillion, nearly five times India’s GDP. Just seven stocks now make up 34 per cent of US stock market capitalisation. Mag 7 stocks have belted out a 38 per cent CAGR in the last 10 years. But after a decade of scorching earnings growth and even more scorching stock price performance, some market veterans are beginning to question if the hyper-scaler story has been stretched too far. There are worries about whether AI monetisation will lag capex, and if Mag 7 companies will end up decimating both their cash flows and shareholder returns in their pursuit of GenAI. Comparisons are beginning to be made to the infamous 1999-2000 dotcom bubble (See Big Story). Therefore, Indian investors who need dollar exposures in their portfolio because of specific goals, should explore stocks outside the Mag 7 and gold at this juncture. Others should stick to Indian equities and bide their time on overseas diversification. Published on September 20, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: Missed the gold rush? Here's why some collectors start with silver

Price rallies, like the recent surge in the gold market, can inspire FOMO, the fear of missing out. This week, the price of gold topped $3,700 per ounce, roughly twice its level two years ago — and the precious metal is on track for a record year. The high unit price for gold bars and coins could have some collectors feeling priced out of the market. A one-ounce gold bar or coin, like the Golden Eagle, is now worth as much as a well-used car. But there's another precious metal that's also been on the rise recently — one that's a lot more affordable when it comes to the kind of physical forms available at Costco or a local dealer. "Gains in gold attract ancillary buying in silver, possibly by investors who have not taken full advantage of the gold rally," HSBC precious metals analyst James Steel wrote in a note last month. In percentage terms, silver's rally of 47% this year so far outpaces gold's 39%, as of midday Friday. The two-year gains for both metals are remarkably similar. "If gold keeps going up, silver, with a lag, will do the same," said Ed Yardeni, a market veteran and president of consulting firm Yardeni Research. He expects gold to reach $4,000 by the end of this year, as some other Wall Street investors have predicted. Currently at around $43 per ounce, silver's lower price per ounce has made it an entry point for some novice collectors who don't have to spend nearly as much cash to begin learning the ups and downs of owning physical precious metals. That's what one collector previously told Business Insider he did when starting out, later shifting into gold when he got more comfortable buying metals and realized how much more storage space silver requires. "I'm not going to be able to carry a suitcase full of silver around," this collector said. While silver has several similarities with gold, it also carries more risk, thanks largely to its heavy use in industrial applications that tie it more to the economy. "Silver is more volatile, typically both up and down, so it's a wilder ride," Stefan Gleason, CEO of Money Metals Exchange, a large US precious metals dealer, told Business Insider. "It's not something that you should be looking at in terms of a short-term investment because of that." While silver lacks gold's advantage as a widely accepted reserve stock, it has seen several price rallies in recent years that correlate strongly with gold, though silver tends to be delayed a bit. "Silver very much acts like a leveraged play on gold," Gleason said. "It goes up more when gold goes up, particularly in the latter half of a bull market, and it goes down more when gold goes down." Gleason sees more upside to silver, given the historically wide price ratio between gold and silver right now. Investors scrutinize that, Steel wrote. Steel's August forecast, however, did not anticipate silver prices staying above $40 per ounce for very long. That could be because some collectors are using this run of relatively high gold and silver prices to cash out, Steel found. That's increasing the supply on the market. "We're actually doing more buying of metal, back from back from our customers and from the public than we've ever done," Gleason also said. Still, as any avid collector knows and a novice will quickly learn, buying precious metals is a long play. Ownership often introduces new puzzles to solve, like where to store it, whether to insure it, and who to sell it to if the need arises. Those are lessons that can be learned as easily with silver as with gold — at a fraction of the cost. Get the latest Gold price here. Get the latest Silver price here. Jump to

Title: President Trump to impose $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications to encourage hiring Americans

Update font size. Reset President Donald Trump is anticipated to issue a proclamation reforming the H-1B visa program, mandating a $100,000 application fee to encourage hiring American workers. The proclamation limits H-1B entry to applications accompanied by this fee, citing that program abuse has displaced American workers. Additionally, Trump intends to direct the Labor Secretary to adjust prevailing-wage levels for the H-1B program to prevent visas from being used to undercut wages typically paid to American workers. Josh Wingrove and Hadriana Lowenkron for Bloomberg News: ‎ The move is the latest immigration reform by the Trump administration and will heavily affect the technology industry in particular, as it relies heavily on H-1Bs. The administration argues that the revisions will bring more certainty to legitimate filings under the program by weeding out abuses. In a fact sheet set seen by Bloomberg News, the White House said American workers are being replaced with lower-paid foreign labor and called it a national security threat. The dynamic is suppressing wages and disincentivizing Americans from choosing careers in STEM fields, the White House said. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the $100,000 figure was in addition to, or inclusive of, existing fees that are much more modest. Fees directly tied to the H-1B visa application currently include a $215 fee to register for the lottery and a $780 fee for a Form I-129, which is a petition for a non-immigrant worker that is filed by an employer sponsor. H-1B visas are awarded based on a lottery system, but Bloomberg News has reported previously that flaws in the system create loopholes that some employers exploit by flooding the lottery with entries. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: The following editorial was published by The New York Times‘ Editorial Board, June 16, 2016, five months prior to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election: Visa Abuses Harm American Workers There is no doubt that H-1B visas — temporary work permits for specially talented foreign professionals — are instead being used by American employers to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. Abbott Laboratories, the health care conglomerate based in Illinois, recently became the latest large American company to use the visas in this way, following the lead of other employers, including Southern California Edison, Northeast Utilities (now Eversource Energy), Disney, Toys “R” Us and New York Life. The visas are supposed to be used only to hire college-educated foreigners in “specialty occupations” requiring “highly specialized knowledge,” and only when such hiring will not depress prevailing wages. But in many cases, laid-off American workers have been required to train their lower-paid replacements. Lawmakers from both parties have denounced the visa abuse, but it is increasingly widespread, mainly because of loopholes in the law. For example, in most instances, companies that hire H-1B workers are not required to recruit Americans before hiring from overseas. Similarly, companies are able to skirt the rules for using H-1B workers by outsourcing the actual hiring of those workers to Tata, Infosys and other temporary staffing firms, mostly based in India. Criticism of the visa process has been muted, and reform has moved slowly, partly because laid-off American workers — mostly tech employees replaced by Indian guest workers — have not loudly protested. Their reticence does not mean acceptance or even resignation. As explained in The Times on Sunday by Julia Preston, most of the displaced workers had to sign agreements prohibiting them from criticizing their former employers as a condition of receiving severance pay. The gag orders have largely silenced the laid-off employees, while allowing the employers to publicly defend their actions as legal, which is technically accurate, given the loopholes in the law. The conversation, however, is changing. Fourteen former tech workers at Abbott, including one who forfeited a chunk of severance pay rather than sign a so-called nondisparagement agreement, have filed federal claims with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission saying they were discriminated against because of their ages and American citizenship. Tech workers from Disney have filed federal lawsuits accusing the company and two global outsourcing firms of colluding to supplant Americans with H-1B workers. Former employees of Eversource Energy have also begun to challenge their severance-related gag orders by publicly discussing their dismissals and replacement by foreign workers on H-1B and other visas. Congressional leaders of both parties have questioned the nondisparagement agreements. Bipartisan legislation in the Senate would revise visa laws to allow former employees to protest their layoffs. Beyond that, what Congress really needs to do is close the loopholes that allow H-1B abuses. — The New York Times‘ Editorial Board, June 16, 2016 ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Since well before the glorious 2016 election, I’ve been explaining Trump’s position and why the likes of Tim Cook supported his crooked, perennial failure of an opponent: For Silicon Valley and Apple’s Tim Cook, it’s all about H-1B visas and cheap labor. American companies and their shareholders, in general, want skilled labor as CHEAPLY as possible. That’s a main reason why Tim Cook, Apple and other tech firms backed the loser Clinton – they wanted unlimited H-1Bs to continue, so they can pay Ajeet from India half what they’d have to pay Tom from Tulsa who can’t find a job after graduating from college and has to live in his parents basement because Apple got Ajeet from India to do it on the CHEAP. H1-B visas for skilled workers DO NOT EQUAL uneducated illegal aliens streaming across the southern border intent on cashing in on American taxpayer’s largesse while setting up shop in the domestic drug trade and/or other crimes (gangs, rape, robbery, etc.). Trump is for upholding the laws already on the books designed to protect our borders and our nation’s sovereignty. The 2016 Trump campaign’s policy: Increase prevailing wage for H-1Bs. We graduate two times more Americans with STEM degrees each year than find STEM jobs, yet as much as two-thirds of entry-level hiring for IT jobs is accomplished through the H-1B program. More than half of H-1B visas are issued for the program’s lowest allowable wage level, and more than eighty percent for its bottom two. Raising the prevailing wage paid to H-1Bs will force companies to give these coveted entry-level jobs to the existing domestic pool of unemployed native and immigrant workers in the U.S., instead of flying in cheaper workers from overseas. This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program. Mark Zuckerberg’s personal Senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities. Requirement to hire American workers first. Too many visas, like the H-1B, have no such requirement. In the year 2015, with 92 million Americans outside the workforce and incomes collapsing, we need companies to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed. Petitions for workers should be mailed to the unemployment office, not USCIS. End welfare abuse. Applicants for entry to the United States should be required to certify that they can pay for their own housing, healthcare and other needs before coming to the U.S. Jobs program for inner city youth. The J-1 visa jobs program for foreign youth will be terminated and replaced with a resume bank for inner city youth provided to all corporate subscribers to the J-1 visa program. Refugee program for American children. Increase standards for the admission of refugees and asylum-seekers to crack down on abuses. Use the monies saved on expensive refugee programs to help place American children without parents in safer homes and communities, and to improve community safety in high crime neighborhoods in the United States. Immigration moderation. Before any new green cards are issued to foreign workers abroad, there will be a pause where employers will have to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed immigrant and native workers. This will help reverse women’s plummeting workplace participation rate, grow wages, and allow record immigration levels to subside to more moderate historical averages. And, furthermore: End H1B. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/z6uuYiaXC1 — 🇺🇸Truth Teller🇺🇸 (@truthteller_x1) September 18, 2025 Perfect posting, First Then. You nailed it. The purpose of the H-1B visa program is to attract top talent without reducing U.S. wages, but most H-1B positions pay below-median wages; just one in six reaches the highest wage level. Replacing the random lottery with a wage-based ranking system would curb abuse, prioritize high-skilled roles, and better align with the program’s original goals. Also, why does the US allow vast numbers of Chinese to exploit the program, considering China is our fiercest rival? Shouldn’t we favor Japanese, Korean, i.e. friendly countries instead? Charging a $100K fee seems the wrong solution, now only large companies will be able to afford it. Definitely need to ban the gag orders, and give clear rights to foreigners who qualify for the program. What foreign worker is going to complain about unfair treatment or sub-standard wages, when they know they can easily be kicked out by their employer. Companies should have to prove not only that they are hiring a foreigner because no Americans are available, but also prove they are paying competitive wages, and workers should have some kind of leverage to “shop around” on a regular basis, without fear of being deported. Think of foreign players in the NBA for example. There shouldn’t be issues of highly-qualified foreigners working at USA companies if everyone is competing on a level playing field. The H-1B visa program tilted the field towards the companies because of too many dumb regulations. There is a Section 1(c) Exemption In Trump’s H-1B Fee Proclamation “… the Secretary of Homeland Security has the full right to determine at its discretion the applications of companies for H-1B visa holders. It would grant the exemption of $100,000 fee only if it finds the occupation workers are in the national interest and do not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States.” You are right, only large companies can afford the fees – or the option above… https://www.news18.com/business/explained-what-is-section-1c-exemption-in-trumps-h-1b-fee-proclamation-who-can-get-relief-ws-l-9585654.html Your email address will not be published.

September 19, 2025 16:44 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=168147&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases.

September 19, 2025 13:18 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming September 30, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR NOVO NORDISK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk cut its previously issued fiscal year 2025 guidance, lowering sales growth from 13-21% to 8-14%, and operating profit from 16-24% to 10-16%. The Company cited lower growth expectations for both Ozempic and Wegovy on the back of a slowdown in market expansion, competition, and the alleged continued use of compounded GLP-1s. On this news, Novo Nordisk’s stock price fell $15.06, or 21.8%, to close at $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Novo Nordisk repeatedly ignored and minimized the significance of the personalization exception for GLP-1 compounding, greatly overestimated its ability to capture patients coming off of compounded treatments, and was ultimately ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported significant unmet patient population; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 30, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: As sure as Night ’n Day: Family-run business that rose from a corner dairy to 54 franchise stores – can it disrupt supermarket duopoly?

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Night ’n Day general manager Matt Lane and one of the company's newest franchise stores - in Kawarau, near Queenstown. Composite photo / Oliver Rusden They hit headlines recently by selling 20,000 blocks of cut-price butter. Shayne Currie charts the rise of Night ’n Day, a family-owned business with a franchise network of more than 50 stores. Does New Zealand’s third-biggest grocery retailer hold a key to breaking the supermarket duopoly? Bridget Stevens started working in the shop as a teenager, serving at the counter every second weekend. At 15, she left school for a fulltime job in the store. By the time she was 34, she owned it. Now, another 17 years later, Stevens – along with her sister, Rebecca Excell – runs one of the most renowned Night ’n Day stores in the country. In Winton, Southland, the pair have 25 staff and a steady stream of customers: the locals who they know on a first-name basis, the truckies lining up at 6am for coffee and hot food and the State Highway 6 travellers popping in for a road-trip snack before heading north to Queenstown or south to Invercargill. “It was just a little corner dairy when I started,” Stevens says. “Olly Olsson was the owner, Mum worked here as well. When I turned 15, Mum left and they offered me her fulltime job – I left school and came here.” Then, 17-and-a-half years ago, Olsson sold up. He’d been at Night ’n Day’s annual conference and returned home to Winton, informing Stevens that he was offering her the business first. “I couldn’t stop crying. He was like, ‘Right, go and talk to your parents about it’. I went and got advice from Mum and Dad, and they were like, ‘That’s a no-brainer’.” In 2017, Excell bought into the business – she is now a 40% shareholder in the franchise. Together, the pair make a formidable team – the store has now won five store-of-the-year awards, including their most recent just last week. They say they complement each other well – Stevens with her knowledge and history; Excell, who trained at one point to be a teacher but never made it to the classroom, with her administrative skills. They both have a natural rapport with their staff. “Before Dad passed away, he was the referee,” Excell laughs, when asked if there have ever been any sisterly squabbles. “He used to come in and sort us out.” Mum still keeps an eye on the shop as well. “She’s very proud,” Stevens says. Family connections and community links run deep at Night ’n Day. Among many examples, there’s father-and-son combination Alan and Hamish Garrick, who own four Night ’n Day stores in Queenstown and Arrowtown, and husband-and-wife Sukhwinder Singh and Manjit Kaur, who own the Mt Maunganui and Rotorua stores. At the top of the business is general manager Matt Lane, who was born in 1990, the same year that his parents, Andrew and Denise – the original Night ’n Day founders – turned their fledgling group of stores into a franchise chain. The Lane family has owned Night ’n Day’s original Regent Rd store in Dunedin since 1984, buying an ageing grocer’s shop with a decaying floor and transforming it, eventually, into a 24-hour student mecca, selling all manner of hangover-curtailing staples (a hot steak pie and Coca Cola, anyone?). The Regent Rd store remains world-famous in Dunedin, but 35 years on from its launch as a franchise business, Night ’n Day has expanded well beyond its Otago roots, now operating 54 stores across New Zealand. It is the country’s third-biggest retail grocery chain. At the same time, the company is pushing for a more level playing field to take on the supermarket duopoly of Foodstuffs – which runs New World, Pak’nSave and Four Square – and Woolworths NZ (previously Progressive), the owner of Woolworths and Fresh Choice/Super Value. Last month, Night ’n Day rolled back the price of butter to August 2024 prices. Rather than a 500g block of yellow gold selling for around $11, Night ‘n Day sold 20,000 blocks – they were limited to one per customer – for $6.50 each. An effective marketing campaign and publicity stunt, it certainly forced home a point about the hefty price of butter, with the duopoly in the spotlight, and broader consumer speculation of a major new competitor. “I think too much focus is on a third player,” Matt Lane told Karen O’Leary of the Paddy Gower Has Issues TV show. “How can we change the market to be a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth? Let’s not limit ourselves. Are the small centres going to end up with Costco’s? Absolutely not. “Is Timaru, is Greymouth? They’re not going to end up with a Costco, so why should [those towns] be disadvantaged purely because we’re trying to get an international player that competes in the major cities to try and compress prices?” Lane tells the Herald that the duopoly situation has been a long-term problem since the early 2000s and, therefore, needs long-term solutions. He’s a big fan of the Government effectively carpet-bombing the problem with solutions, rather than a piecemeal approach. “I feel – and it’s easy for me to say this – that there needs to be an overcorrection and then wind it back if necessary, rather than just trying to take one step, then one step, and then one step, and saying, ‘Is it actually working?’” The Government, the Commerce Commission and “the whole of New Zealand know it’s an issue”, Lane says. “We seem to be content just to say, ‘We’ll try and tweak wholesale, or create a wholesale supplier. We’ll try and tweak some of the competition rules or the land covenants’. “Let’s try to fix everything. If we find that something is a bit harsh, you can still dial it back again to find that parity, but we’re a long way away from creating competition.” Night ’n Day was once a member of the Foodstuffs co-operative, giving it access to wholesale prices of dry grocery items. That came to a halt in 2011 - Foodstuffs has previously cited breaches of its membership agreement; the decision also coincided with Night ’n Day partnering up with Gull to open 21 new stores in the North Island. The grocery challenges have meant some Night ’n Day stores lost the ability to hold liquor licences. Because grocery wholesale prices jumped and therefore the retail price lifted, they weren’t selling enough relevant products to be deemed a grocery retailer (and therefore able to also sell booze). Despite these hurdles, Night ‘n Day is a big business success story, largely because of its agility and a necessary pivot away from a focus on groceries – they’re still there, but currently more expensive because of the wholesale issues – to a more purposeful, competitive offering within three distinct pillars: coffee, milk bar and fresh food-to-go/deli foods. “That’s because everyone can access different prices and you can create a differentiation of the product,” Lane says. “That’s where we see a massive amount of growth and that allowed us to sustain our operations because we lost all the profitability and sales of grocery.” While serving barista coffee and hot food might seem common sense, New Zealand has a reputation for leading these retail trends internationally. Lane recalls being at a US retail conference when an expert speaker’s suggestion of barista coffee – rather than the instant, filter variety – was met with gasps and concern in the American audience. New Zealand had been selling it for years. Night ’n Day has also been turbocharged in recent years with delivery service in the form of Uber Eats, Door Dash and Deliver Easy. “It’s the next step of convenience,” Lane says. “Historically, we’re a convenience store because you can get in and out very quickly based on the format size.” Now, convenience arrives at your front door. “People are living a lot more here and now. They’re living for the moment. They value their time a lot more.” While Night ’n Day has a network of 54 stores dotted from Southland to Whangārei and is always looking to grow, Lane says there is no magical number. “It’s the quality over quantity for us. We look at every opportunity as it comes across. We certainly don’t sit there ... being complacent with what we’ve got. “We do want to grow, but we want to make sure that it works, first of all, for the brand, franchisees and the site itself.” Lane reveals the company is looking at several potential new sites, including one at Jack’s Point, in Queenstown, as well as exploring some further options in Dunedin. There is also a “clear gap” in Hamilton. “It just feels like that’s a logical city we’re not part of, when you look at our geographical spread.” An indication of a franchise value is revealed on Night ’n Day’s own website. Right now, two franchises are listed for sale - Cromwell, for $680,000 plus stock at valuation (an estimated $160,000), and Dee St in Invercargill, for $450,000 plus stock at valuation (estimated at $125,000). According to the website, the Cromwell store has a weekly turnover of $62,700 and Dee St has a weekly turnover of $51,000. The average gross profit for each site is 34%. Lane talks of Night ’n Day having more agility than similar-sized retail convenience brands. “We can’t compete on [a marketing] budget with the BPs and the Zs in terms of doing things that way. We’ve just got to do it by creating a point of difference and we do that through our supplier base, speed to market, the ability to have an idea in the morning and execute it in the afternoon.” Like Bridget Stevens in Winton, Matt Lane first experienced life in the shop as a young teenager, stacking shelves. That later became a university job behind the counter, alongside a number of his mates. After graduating from Otago University and working for four years at Deloitte, he came back into the business in 2016, working in business development and then finance before becoming general manager in 2019. Lane’s mother, Denise Lane, says she and her husband, Andrew, owned two standalone dairies in Dunedin initially. They sold those in 1984 to buy the Regent Rd store in the heart of the student district. It was a good-performing store and long-established on a busy street. The site also became the family home for the Lanes and their young children, with their residence attached. Staff had to use the family toilet. “Our hallway wasn’t a normal hallway – it was all filled with shelves and stock because our house was also our storage room.” Opposite them was a BP station, and the Lanes started hearing whispers that it would start trading 24 hours a day. They acted quickly and got in first. They knew they needed to retain their regular customers – a 24-hour rival threatened to draw them away. While Night ’n Day went 24 hours, the BP never did. It’s no longer there. “It was the first standalone 24-hour convenience store in New Zealand,” Andrew Lane says. “There was nothing like it. It started off slow, but it actually picked up and we thought, ‘we’re on a winner here’.” Confident that the model could work elsewhere, the couple then sought out and bought the best dairies in Invercargill and Christchurch. In 1990, the couple were at a National Association of Retail Grocers of New Zealand (Nargon) conference where they met representatives from the Night Owl convenience chain from Australia. “At that stage, we had five stores and they had 10 or 11, and they explained to us about franchising, which we’d never heard of as a business system back then. We’d probably heard of the McDonald’s way of doing things, but didn’t really know too much about it,” Andrew Lane says. “They explained what they had gone through – they said you should really look at it, it’ll move you away from the day-to-day hassles of operating a convenience store, and you’ll be able to help other people replicate what you’ve done. “We did some investigation into franchising and we thought, well, yeah, this system works and it works well. And we said, if we’re going to do that, then we’ve got to come up with a brand.” With the help and expertise of a Dunedin graphics designer, they came up with the Night ’n Day concept and worked over the following months to develop systems, including operations manuals. The other dairies were rebranded. Andrew Lane was worried about that, but he says there was no pushback. “There was none at all; it was all in our head!” Denise Lane puts a myth to bed that the blue-and-gold colours were a nod to their Otago heritage. Not at all, she says – they represent night and day. Matt Lane says there is no one “silver bullet” to compete against the supermarkets. “We need the foundations to be able to compete, whether it’s ourselves, whether it’s The Warehouse, whether it’s a new player coming in. More competition in this space helps us, even if we’re not the leader in it. “Do we want to grow? Yes, absolutely. The only way I can see it happening, though, is through the existing set-ups. “It’s very hard for any player to sit there and go, I’m going to open opposite a Pak’nSave and compete. It’s just not going to happen. There’s not the brand presence. There’s not the pockets to be able to do so. “We’ve grown organically over time. We’ve utilised the conversion of some Four Square stores to be able to do that. “To start creating competition, I think one of the most important things is removing the restraints of trade on the duopoly stores. If someone is currently operating a Four Square and they want to convert or go independent, there should be no barriers for them to do so.” Lane points out there’s not a lack of brands in New Zealand, it’s a commonality of ownership. “If you had Pak’nSave, Fresh Choice, New World, Woolworths and Four Square all competing against each other, it would actually be quite a competitive marketplace and they’d all try and take each other’s market share. “Whereas what we’ve got is quite a complacent duopoly where everyone just plays in their own space ... ” Lane also points out that for every day that the status quo remains, the duopoly grows stronger. “They’re opening new stores, they’re creating a better footprint, they’re cementing brand awareness. “Competitors are getting more and more nervous. It’s one thing to come out and go, we’re going to fix the supermarket industry – that happened in 2021. We’re now in 2025. “My discussion to MBIE [the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment] was there’s been nothing given to me that has improved my business and my ability to compete that wasn’t available to me in 2021. So we’re four years deep and I don’t have one tangible thing I can point to say, ‘This is helping me grow and succeed’. “But then you go, ‘Who is going to take the risk and why would they take the risk in the New Zealand market?’ Bit different in the States or Australia, given the population size and density. “But there needs to be a genuine motivation or genuine support to actually be able to encourage people to do that.” After first interviewing Lane in early August, I went back to him this week for an update. “No public announcement has benefited us to increasing competition, however what is encouraging is the key components that will improve competition are still being worked though and considered. “It is a wait-and-see, but there is still a lot of resource being allocated to increasing competition and I’m hopeful something will eventuate.” For all their success, Andrew and Denise Lane remain remarkably grounded – they are thrilled to see new generations of families in their franchise stores coming through the business. “I don’t know if I see it as a major success story,” Andrew Lane says. “I probably see it more as something that we just wanted to achieve and just kept on achieving it to grow.” He says when the business entered its franchising structure in 1990, it was with the intention of mentoring and “helping other people enjoy a business that we both thoroughly enjoyed, and to grow like that”. Denise Lane adds: “It was a case of long, hard hours. I guess we never thought it was going to get to where we are now. “It was like a Ferris wheel – when you got on the ride, you couldn’t get off it until it stopped. It has not stopped yet.” Disclaimer: Night ’n Day recently sponsored the NZ Herald’s Great NZ Road Trip project. This article is an independent editorial story.

Shares of Netskope (NTSK) surged Friday, extending gains after making their debut on the Nasdaq Thursday. The stock was up close to 7% around $24 in recent trading, after finishing Thursday's session 18% above their initial public offering (IPO) price of $19 per share. The IPO price was at the high end of the company’s expectations, and the 47.8 million shares sold helped Netskope raise $908.2 million. CEO Sanjay Beri told Yahoo! Finance in a televised interview that he expects going public could help boost the company's credibility and customer awareness. Netskope, which counts companies like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Zscaler (ZS) as competitors, reported a 31% year-over-year jump in revenue to $328 million for the six months ended in July, according to a regulatory filing. It's $170 million net loss over that period narrowed from $207 million a year ago. This has been a strong year so far for a number of cybersecurity stocks, amid expectations the sector could get a boost from strong demand trends as AI-driven threats grow. Zscaler shares have added over 60% of their value in 2025, while CrowdStrike (CRWD) has climbed close to 50%. Palo Alto Networks shares have added about 13%, roughly in line with the S&P 500's rise over the same period.

Title: Stock Buybacks Have Slowed. Here's Why It Matters That They Could Bounce Back.

A slump in stock buybacks could be in the rearview mirror. What that means for stocks is more complicated. S&P 500 buybacks in the second quarter fell 20% from record highs in the first quarter, but they are expected tick up in the current one. With economic policy uncertainty starting to dissipate and interest rates headed lower, repurchase activity from companies in the broad market index is expected to return to record levels, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Wall Street analysts, however, say buybacks may not be as helpful to EPS growth as they once were. Headline buyback figures are big, but their growth has stalled lately even for the biggest companies in the index. Companies like Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA), which usually account for about 30% of annual buyback spending, posted no meaningful year-over-year growth in the second quarter, according to a recent Goldman Sachs report. A lack of buyback activity has resulted in a lower buyback yield—which measures total buybacks over a given period divided by market cap at the start of that period—for the the S&P 500 over the past 12 months. The figure recently touched 2%, the lowest level in 20 years, excluding recessions. (That is, however, partly due to big spending on artificial intelligence that has contributed to a decline in share repurchases.) Share prices have risen faster than earnings have, and payout ratios have fallen, leading to higher price-to-earnings multiples and lower buyback yields. A falling buyback yield means less of a boost to earnings per share: Buybacks result in lower shares outstanding, and buybacks from 2005 to 2019 boosted EPS growth by a median of 1.2 percentage points annually, according to Goldman. That tailwind has fallen off lately. The decline in the S&P's buyback yield is expected to level off as share repurchasing activity returns, per Goldman. The firm estimates share repurchases to total $1 trillion this year, 5% higher than in 2024. But in the meantime, companies that have sustained buyback activity—so-called buyback aristocrats, or companies that consistently repurchase their shares—could benefit from a rising scarcity premium, Goldman analysts including Ben Snider wrote. The median buyback aristocrat tends to have larger market-caps, higher buyback yields, lower valuations relative to the broader index, and generated a higher year-to-date return. The list of aristocrats includes Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Applied Materials (AMAT), eBay (EBAY), Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX Cos. (TJX), according to Goldman.

Title: This Week in Games - Nintendo September Direct 2025
URL: https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-games/2025-09-19/nintendo-september-direct-2025/.228798

Full Content:
Welcome back, folks! I hope everyone enjoyed my cameo appearance in This Week in Anime yesterday. I'd have made a cute segue for it in last week's column, but things were arranged a bit too late for that. It's always nice to collaborate with Steve, Coop, and Chris, especially when I can chat about topics I'm familiar with. I got to meet Chris in person for the first time a few weeks back; he's just as charming as his writing. We were also able to meet up with fellow This Week in Anime alums Nicky. Good times were had by all! Today, though, we're covering a ton of news—so let's begin. People sure love tempting the Persona 5 curse. You'd think after Star Ocean: anamnesis, Dragalia Lost and the Fullmetal Alchemist gacha, folks would have a bit of trepidation about collaborating with Persona 5. Oh well! Here comes Overwatch 2. Overwatch 2 has had a lot of collaborations with Japanese media lately, and they've been hit-or-miss. The One-Punch Man outfits didn't look great, and the Cowboy Bebop collab was all right (given some weird faces). This time, the suits look pretty good. Mercy as Panther/Ana actually looks pretty great, and I can't fault any of the other choices (D.Va as Queen/Makoto, Genji as Skull/Ryuji, Wuyang as Joker/Akira, and Lifeweaver as Fox/Yusuke). They've even got art from Shigenori Soejima; that's at least as much effort Fortnite would put into one of these. The collab started on September 16; at the time of writing, further details haven't been released. I snark, but the skins look legitimately cool. I might be a bit burnt out at the sight of Persona 5, and Overwatch has never really done anything for me. But kudos to Blizzard for finally getting one of these right. A major surprise dropped into our laps earlier this week with the reveal of two new Game Boy Advance titles added to Nintendo's NSO+ service—and both of them are third-party titles from Bandai Namco! While they were exclusives to Nintendo's old handheld, this opens a lot of fun doors for the NSO+ library. Provided, we might want to keep those reins in check: these likely came about because Nintendo and Bandai Namco have some very close business relations. Those old side-scrollers starring Nickelodeon characters might still be a bridge too far, more's the pity. First up is Mr. Driller, Bandai Namco's long-running puzzle series starring the eponymous miner. The Mr. Driller games are fun, hectic puzzlers: using your drill, you tunnel your way through variously-colored minerals, with entire blocks of like-colored minerals vanishing at once. But as you drill your way through, blocks that aren't affixed to larger blocks will fall behind you, forcing you to keep on digging to keep from getting caught in the cave-in. Complicating things is your oxygen meter: you lose air as you drill, and harder minerals require more effort (and thus more air), forcing you to be careful in choosing your path as you tunnel. It can be a long way between spare air tanks... Mr. Driller has never been a massive hit for Bandai Namco, but the games are fun—especially if you can take them on the go. Also fun is the lore behind the title: canonically, the titular Mr. Driller, Susumu Hori, is the son of Dig-Dug's hero, Taizo Hori. Taizo has even made cameo appearances in other Mr. Driller games! (The mom is Toby Masuyo, protagonist of Baraduke/Alien Sector. According to Namco x Capcom, Toby and Taizo had an acrimonious divorce.) The other game is another attention-nabber: Bandai Namco's beloved Klonoa: Empire of Dreams! I have a soft spot for the Klonoa titles: deceptively deep platformers with stunning presentation and music, and stories that rip your heart out. Empire of Dreams sees the Dream Traveler Klonoa having to clear his name of the crime of "dreaming of adventure." Of course, there's a reason why dreams have been outlawed, and Klonoa is likely to make us shed a few tears as he finds out the truth... Empire of Dreams continues the series' traditional mechanics: Klonoa can jump and flutter around a bit by flapping his cute, floppy ears. Klonoa also has his Wind Ring, which lets him inflate enemies. From there, Klonoa can carry them around, throw them at other enemies, or throw them after jumping to extend his jump. It's basic stuff on paper, but eventually expanded into surprisingly complicated platforming sections. The Klonoa titles might be cute, but 100% completion is a true challenge in those titles. My heart always weeps for Klonoa. We were fortunate enough a few years ago to get the Phantasy Reverie Series back in 2022, and I was luckier still to get to review it. Bandai Namco even teased a possible Klonoa 3 if the collection sold well enough... but it's been three years. At the very least, the Phantasy Reverie Series regularly goes on sale for very cheap; at around $10, these are some of the best platformers you can get your hands on. I'd at least like to hope that Empire of Dreams coming to NSO+ means that the other GBA Klonoa titles are on the table. Dream Champ Tournament is also cute, but Legendary Star Medal never came to the United States. We can only hope for more chances to hear Klonoa's adorable "WA-HOO!" Both of these titles go live on NSO+ this September 25. Last week, I mentioned how Nintendo and Pokémon have become a serious "bitch eating crackers" for the gaming industry and for self-described "Gamers." For folks unfamiliar with the phrase, a "bitch eating crackers" is when you have such dislike for someone that something as innocuous as them eating crackers at the other side of the room ticks you off. I maintain that. Mind you: More than a few decisions in the following Direct did turn me off... but also, I wasn't catastrophizing about this being the worst display of arrogance from a company that "needs to be humbled." Because there wasn't any need to. I worry if I'm the crazy one, but then I read past the headline of an article... With 2025 being the 40th anniversary of the Mario Brothers, Nintendo has arranged for several fun goodies: special art and light displays at the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto, sponsoring the annual Kyoto Marathon... fun stuff. There was also the news that the Mario Bros. sequel is being developed, and it's going with Super Mario Galaxy. (A lot of folks have pointed out that Old Spice jumped the gun a little and spoiled the reveal with some of their promotional stock that is in stores now. Whoops.) Weird that the movie is going with Galaxy, but considering that none of the other Mario games escalate on the level Galaxy does, I see where they're coming from. Doki Doki Panic has been buried; Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World only really introduce the Koopalings, which aren't enough of a draw; Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine don't really shake up the formula enough, and Illumination still thinks Chris Pratt is more charming than Charlie Day, so that's a no-go on Luigi's Mansion. No word yet on who's playing Princess Rosalina, but Rosalina's storybook (as in, an actual physical representation of it) is for sale on Nintendo's website and set to release this November 25. The real disappointment was the news that Super Mario Galaxy and its sequel are getting a remastered physical release—at full price, US$70. This is following the Super Mario Bros 3D All-Stars, which already included the first Super Mario Galaxy. Let me be clear, I think people have lost their damn minds when it comes to game price discourse. I saw someone comment that Digimon Story: Time Stranger "doesn't look AAA, so it shouldn't be priced like a AAA game," which is a great way of completely disregarding the amount of effort that went into actually producing the game. It is my genuine belief that Steam's firehouse sales have destroyed any semblance of value when it comes to a game; why buy a game at full price when you can get it for 20% off at the Summer Sale? And why pay that when you can get it for 30% off at the Winter Sale? And why pay that when you can get it for $5 at the next Spring Sale? I feel like the effort put into remaking a game top-to-bottom isn't invalidated just because the game was originally released on Game Boy or because you can't see the individual scales on Gomamon's Marching Fishes. That said, US$70 for both Super Mario Galaxy games is where I draw the line. Both of those titles were US$20 on the Wii U! We already had Super Mario Galaxy in the first 3D collection! This is what a piss-take looks like, if you ask me. But this got weirdly ignored following the further news. At any rate, it releases on October 2, with promotional Amiibo (Mario with a Luma, and Rosalina reading a book to several Luma) releasing on April 2. I rather like the Rosalina Luma a lot. I'd rather buy that than the US$70 two-pack. I regret to inform you all that the following news involves tennis. (Cue the clip of Rex Mohs screaming his soul out in disgust.) We're getting a new Mario Tennis game, titled Mario Tennis Fever. The titular gimmick is the fever rackets: tennis rackets that can build up energy over the course of a rally to activate special effects. There are over 30 Fever Rackets, with all sorts of effects like freezing the opponent's side of the court or summoning Mini Mushrooms. There is also a record-breaking amount of characters in Mario Tennis, over 30. There are also a variety of modes, like the standard Tournament mode and online Ranked modes, along with a mode for motion controls or randomized effects on the court ("Mix-It-Up" mode). The Adventure Mode is most intriguing. It's a story mode where the Mario characters are turned into babies and have to relearn tennis skills as they travel through a world. It's a good way to mask a tutorial mode, especially for people who aren't great at tennis simulators. Mario Tennis Fever releases on February 12, 2026, but, y'know, it's tennis without Ultra-Smashes. Super Mario Wonder is also getting a dedicated port on Nintendo Switch 2—but it's not just a graphical update. New features and content were teased, but we won't hear about that until later. The main feature the Direct focused on was the Bellabel Park update, which adds a variety of multiplayer options. A lot of these are actually quite fun as party games. Also, like, if we're getting toys of Nintendo characters, can we get more Yoshi toys? There's so much money left on the table from Nintendo not making a full stable of Yoshi toys. Speaking of the T. Yoshisaur Munchakoopas: A thing I appreciate about the Yoshi games is their use of different aesthetics. The original Yoshi's Island was ostensibly a Super Mario World sequel—but it abandoned the look of the original game in favor of a crayonesque design, along with its own unique platforming mechanics (i.e., carrying Baby Mario around). Yoshi's Story wasn't great, but its pop-up book aesthetic still looks pretty good. And so on with other games like Yoshi's Woolly World. So Nintendo's going all-in with Yoshi and the Mysterious Book. With the help of the encyclopedia, Mister E (get it?), Yoshi and his friends must fill out the missing pages. The whole thing is done as a side-scrolling puzzle game, figuring out the various abilities of the creatures Yoshi encounters while using the world around him to move around. The trailer showcased a puzzle where Yoshi had to spread dandelion seeds to erode a boulder that was in his way; that's some good lateral thinking. They'll have a real winner on their hands if they can properly iterate on that kind of stage construction. Also, I like the in-universe aesthetic. It's a bit Super Mario Wonder in its approach, but with undercranked character animations to sell the "illustrated" aesthetic. See, this is the thing I like seeing from Nintendo; it's disappointing that this kind of attention to detail doesn't get its due appreciation. That's not Bill Trinen! Nintendo had a minor once-over for Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream, going over the basics of character creation and care. But there wasn't much else, outside of the confirmation of a Spring 2026 release. The burning question on everyone's mind is whether Living The Dream will actually incorporate gay/lesbian couples. There was a kerfuffle over the original Tomodachi Life on 3DS, since this was impossible then (outside of a glitch). Games have come a long way in the years since, and even other Nintendo games have allowed for more gender-affirming options, such as referring to body types as "styles." And that's before you consider other titles like the Story of Seasons games, allowing for non-gender-locked relationships. It'll be a significant disappointment if Nintendo doesn't follow along. Here's a funny one. Square Enix originally broke away from Nintendo during development of Final Fantasy VII because Nintendo decided upon a cartridge-based format for the Nintendo 64, and Square Enix (then Squaresoft) had bigger goals in mind for their upcoming title. This was a particularly strong bit for them, so much so that they referenced the matter in their magazine ads. We wouldn't see new Final Fantasy titles on Nintendo consoles for years after that. Anyway, Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade is coming to the Nintendo Switch this January 22. The first part of Square's ambitious three-part remake of the original Final Fantasy VII, the "Integrade" update includes new story beats and stages that center around Yuffie, explaining what she was doing before Cloud and company find her in the forest. There might be some graphical compromises, but I feel like those are small potatoes compared to being able to play a game of Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade's scope on the go. Speaking of Amiibo! Nintendo has decided to introduce a Smash Bros-style mechanic to Kirby Air Riders wherein you can train Amiibo Figure characters. These characters will learn racing techniques as they play against you, up to and including developing a "personality" based around their experiences racing. So far, we only have Kirby on the Warp Star and Bandana Dee (no need for a middle name here) on the Winged Star. But also: the figures are swappable! You can unplug the riders from their machines, which will come in handy with upcoming Riders and Machines that are being teased. You can expect Meta Knight, King Dedede, and Gooey to come along with certain machines. I lack the experience with Kirby Air Riders to make any educated guess on those. Also, because Sakurai's 40-minute Direct focused entirely on Kirby Air Riders wasn't enough, there's going to be a second one in the near future. More updates on Hyrule Warriors: War of Imprisonment! The gameplay stuff sounds fun, but the most important bit is that it's Gameshare compatible: players will be able to play co-op across two consoles with just one copy of the game, including the original Switch model. It's a great move. I honestly wish more games offered this as a feature by default. Anyway, War of Imprisonment adds some new wrinkles to the Hyrule Warriors formula in the form of Tears of the Kingdom's Zonai tech. Using these ancient artifacts, players can mess with enemy groups or alter the battlefield. I appreciate the puzzle-based addition to the battles. I'm still not crazy for the post-Breath of the Wild Hyrule Warriors games because of the original Hyrule Warriors offering so much, but I can't knock them for actually trying to expand the formula. Few things disappoint me than how the gaming community has left Dragon Quest in an ivory tower. If everyone who namedropped Dragon Quest Monsters during the Palworld/Pokémon discourse had actually bought a copy of Dragon Quest Monsters: The Black Prince, Square Enix might have brought over more Dragon Quest Monsters games. And hey, all those arguments about Expedition 33 and Square Enix's turn-based games are incomplete without recognizing all of the work Square Enix has put into titles like Dragon Quest XI (like how the Switch adds a sprite-based mode for playing the game, a la the 3DS remakes). Dragon Quest isn't the end-all, be-all of Japanese RPGs, and there were plenty of other games that were made leading up to their original title on Famicom... but getting anyone to recognize Dragon Quest in America is an uphill battle. At any rate: Dragon Quest VII is getting a remake. And while it's not an HD-2D remake along the lines of the Erdrick Trilogy, it's nevertheless a top-to-bottom remake of the whole game. Er—another one, since we also had a comprehensive 3D remake of Dragon Quest VII back on the 3DS. Dragon Quest VII is a weird entry for the series; while tremendously overshadowed in the United States due to releasing alongside the graphical powerhouse that was Final Fantasy X, DQ7 also had a very long intro; famously, the PS1 original front-ended the game with a lot of puzzles, so much so that it could take you as long as five hours to encounter your first Slime in battle. Of course, there's a story reason: the protagonist accidentally petrifies his village, and he has to recover several stone tablets to break the curse. This whole quest has a very tragic ending, as many vignettes in Dragon Quest do, but it leads to a game that can have triple-digit length. Dragon Quest VII's deal is its class system: much like Final Fantasy V, characters can be given specific jobs for battle, with each victory leading towards improving their proficiency in that class. There are a lot of classes, many of which are unlocked as combinations of other classes. And that's before we get to the Monster classes, earned by fighting monsters. Yes, there's a Metal Slime class, and yes, it's a pain to unlock and master. Look forward to this one on February 5. Here's one that gets me: Nintendo is adding the Virtual Boy's library to the Nintendo Switch Online repertoire, along with other consoles like the Super Nintendo and the Nintendo 64. People have had words about this. For starters, the Virtual Boy was a failure of a console: its early attempts at 3D (plus everything being in shades of red) caused headaches, and the console wasn't very comfortable. All told, only 22 games were made for the console—14 of them are available on the NSO+Expansion service. This includes several... well, I can't call them "classics," but they're still noteworthy. Wario Land was the first game in the series, and had its first entry made on the Virtual Boy, making this the first time it's been ported, ever. There's also Jack Bros., a Shin Megami Tensei spin-off starring Jack Frost, Pyro Jack, and Jack Ripper. The point of contention is that the Virtual Boy games aren't available to play in 2D—they're exclusively designed for 3D play. So to play the Virtual Boy games, you'll need an accessory that effectively re-creates the original console that you'll slot your Switch or Switch 2 into. The accessory costs $100 USD, which I agree, is a lot. I understand why Nintendo made it; it's to keep the games in context and because they likely don't have a way to allow these games to be played in 2D without extensively reworking them—a tall order for 30-year-old games from a failed console. Nobody's playing a Virtual Boy game to play it in 2D anyhow, the way I see it. The bit where I scrunch my nose up is people doomsaying about the $100 add-on... when there's a $25 alternative that's also for sale. If you don't want to spend $100, you don't have to. Heck, I even appreciate that Nintendo found a new use for the Nintendo Labo components. But the discussion begins and ends with the $100 doohickey. I've seen other peers point out how Nintendo also offers Switch-compatible variants of older controllers, from the NES and N64 controllers to even the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive controller for use with the NSO titles; a quick look at Nintendo's store reveals that those are all in the ballpark of $65. My dudes, the cardboard option is cheaper than a N64 controller. There's so much to complain about. I don't understand why this is the straw that breaks the camel's back, nor do I understand why people can't see the cheap option that's literally right there. Speaking of old stuff, Koei Tecmo is bringing back another Fatal Frame title with a remake of Crimson Butterfly. Originally released in 2003(!), Crimson Butterfly tells the story of a young woman named Mio searching for her twin sister, Mayu, in an abandoned town. Along the way, Mio investigates an old ritual that the village was undergoing. Jumpscares and creepy Japanese ghosts ensue. The series' traditional Camera Obscura is still the central mechanic, a camera that can banish ghosts. This one's another comprehensive top-to-bottom remake; if it's half as good as the Mask of the Lunar Eclipse remake from 2023 (which I reviewed), it'll be a treat! Others and I would definitely prefer a new Fatal Frame proper, but this is a good-enough stopgap. Look forward to it in early 2026. I am disappointed that nobody is talking about the new Suika Game. Suika Game was a huge hit among streamers and players alike, and countless Suika Game clones have emerged in its wake, like IntiCreates' PuzzMix. Just this past summer, Shift-Up even had a Suika Game-esque mini-game for their Boom The Ghost event in Goddess of Victory: NIKKE! In upping the ante, Aladdin X has taken the game to the only place left to go: space. Suika Game Planet has you dropping fruit into an orb at the center of the screen. You can arrange the fruit all around the planet, but they can't break its surface (it's more of a bubble, so the edges have some give). Another twist is in the form of Super Evolution, which grants you bonuses depending on how many fruits of which type you've combined in a row. It's even compatible with Game Share on the Switch 2! I don't expect Suika Game to register on most people's radar, but it'll definitely be a fun hit once it lands this Winter. A major twist was delivered regarding Metroid Prime 4: Samus has a sick sci-fi bike! The reveal comes along with the twist that Metroid Prime 4 is now seemingly an open-world game, with Samus riding her new bike across massive vistas in search of new locales to explore. There's some consternation over this, given that Metroid has been at its best when it's nurturing a claustrophobic vibe. I'm with them. The trailer shows a sequence of Samus facing off against a pack of wolf-like creatures during a blizzard; it seems so pedestrian for Samus to be fighting space-wolves, given all of the other bizarre alien life-forms she's encountered. Regardless: Metroid Prime 4 is slated for a December 4 release, with Amiibo and an art book set to release shortly beforehand. Donkey Kong Bananza has some DLC out now. Most of us expected DLC related to the twist reveal in Bananza, but the DLC is only tangentially related: you actually get to explore D.K. Island! It even plays the song from Donkey Kong 64! There's also the new Emerald Rush mode, a rogue-lite mode where Donkey Kong has to smash enough emerald ore within a time frame. You'll find fossils and stuff that can unlock perks as you run around smashing things, and better performance unlocks new stages in lower layers. A unique twist is that the locations for all of the ores and fossils are a constant, so you'll be able to strategize and plan out your route. The news of Pokémon: Pokopia has some people unsettled, if only because your player character is a Ditto who has shapeshifted (badly) into a human. This has deep ramifications for the world of Pokémon that nobody wants to contend with. The idea itself is fun; however, Ditto will meet other Pokémon and learn moves from them that allow it to modify the environment. As the environment is made more comfortable, more Pokémon arrive, teaching Ditto more moves that allow it to create a whole village for the Pokémon to live in. The idea has been likened to Dragon Quest Builders, which I feel is apt (provided I haven't played Dragon Quest Builders yet). It's a cute idea, and I can see it leading into explaining how Pokémon in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games have places to live. Let's go into a lightning round for some other titles: Danganronpa 2 is getting an expanded port with Danganronpa 2x2, which not only includes the base Danganronpa 2 but also a new scenario with a new story. It'll be available next year, also on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. Dynasty Warriors Origins lands on Switch 2 this January 22, with paid DLC announced. Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflections has a March 16 release date. Resident Evil 9 arrives for the Switch 2 on February 27, wildly enough, with Resident Evil VII and Resident Evil: Village in tow. A new Fire Emblem is coming! Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave takes the series to a Greco-Roman setting, where some would-be heroes duke it out in front of their regent in the hopes of having a wish granted. Some fight for revenge, others fight for someone else. Sothis from Fire Emblem: Three Houses is back, so maybe this takes place in the same world? Who knows. I have an issue with Fortune's Weave, though. Several of the lead characters have darker skin; the protagonist we see is ostensibly a Black young man. His design is otherwise okay. I love his hair (he doesn't have the Killmonger haircut!). But a problem he and the other darker-skinned characters have is that they all have an ashy skin color. It does them a disservice. Mika Pikazo took a lot of heat for the toothpaste hair in Fire Emblem Engage, but she did right by the dark-skinned cast like Timerra by giving them beautiful skin tones. Even in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Claude's olive skintone belied his Mediterranean-inspired origins. So it's a disappointment that the ball was dropped with Fortune's Weave. Still, the cast seems interesting, the designs are nice, and I especially like the hairstyles. So I'm hopeful. Here's where everyone lost their marbles. Paid DLC has been announced for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which releases this October 16. Now, this DLC includes new story content, as well as two new Mega Evolutions for Raichu (Raichu X and Raichu Y). The announcement of paid DLC before the game has launched has people outraged... as though this is the first time any game has been announced with paid DLC at launch. The trailer also reveals new Mega Evolutions for the Kalosian starters, Delphox, Chesknight, and Greninja. Notably, these three Pokémon didn't have Mega Evolutions in their original game, which, in the eyes of many, was an oversight. Legends Z-A corrects this... but also, the Mega Stones for these Mega Evolutions are barred behind timed ranked play over the course of three in-game seasons. There has been a lot of discourse about this being beyond the pale and a sign of Nintendo's modern-day "greed." Let's break this down for a minute. First off: the DLC. Where have people been for the past decade? Super Smash Bros. Ultimate had announced paid DLC before it launched, too! And the only carrot on that stick was knowing that the first character in the DLC list was the Piranha Plant! Nintendo has done this with all three Xenoblade Chronicles games on the Switch, going back to Xenoblade 2! Getting the Season passes was how you unlocked a stash of items and the post-game stories (which are effectively games unto themselves). This isn't new! This hasn't been new for years! You can't even say it's exclusive to Nintendo—Sonic Racing Crossworlds also has been promoting paid DLC for the game, and that game hasn't launched either! There's a lot to argue over paid DLC as a means of bilking people out of their money, but that discussion has long since passed us by. One of the funniest clips from my favorite Vtuber is her going through almost a minute's worth of prompts from all the cosmetic DLC she bought before playing the game. For better or worse, paid DLC is just a standard factor in games these days. And you're telling me it's a problem now? In a Pokémon game? I've seen people claim that this artificially inflates the price of Pokémon Legends: Z-A--again, where have people been? Super Smash Bros. Ultimate costs $120 with both season passes—and you're going to want those, if you want to use Kazuya Mishima or Steve! It disturbs me how much people make this their hill to die on after actual years of literally every other publisher and developer going through with it. Especially since this is now such an entrenched belief with people. It's a truism that Nintendo is especially greedy, patent-starved and disrespectful to its fans and you're the crazy one if you bring up receipts proving otherwise. These are stances I can understand coming from rage-bait content creators online, who have the ears of the entire fandom. I am puzzled that people who should know better fall into these talking points. It's not even that paid DLC isn't a bad thing—it's sure as hell not, especially not since so many games had actual content cut from the main game just to be turned into DLC. That people decided Pokémon was where things were a bridge too far is what blows my mind. I half-expect that if Nintendo ever introduces a gacha system in a Pokémon game, it will finally prompt the rest of the industry to abandon the practice. There's also consternation about Pokémon imported from Pokémon Home getting stuck in Legends Z-A if and when they're imported. Again, not fun! I don't like this! But I understand why it's happening: Legends Z-A has a unique battle system and Pokémon data likely has to be reformatted to accommodate it, and it'll likely be too much of a pain to reformat Legends Z-A data back out of Legends Z-A. This means that the unique Mega Evolutions in Legends Z-A are landlocked into the game... for now. Seriously, there's no way Mega Victreebell or Mega Hawlucha aren't going to be made available some other way. Pokémon Champions is still releasing soon, after all. Again, this is disappointing... but people know that you can't import Pokémon from the first two Generations into Gen 3 onward, right? Even now, there's no legal alternative to get Pokémon from Pokémon Gold out of those games. Sure, there were digital alternatives on the 3DS—but if you wanted to rescue your old Lugia from your old cartridge, there's no official means. I'll go a step further, because as much as I dislike this, I still don't think it's the worst. Monster Rancher 4 had an exclusive in-game monster based on Kasumi from Dead or Alive. The only way to get her was by scanning a copy of Dead or Alive: Hardcore for the PlayStation 2. So you had to spend $100 to buy two games, to get a special-edition Monster. And that's just Kasumi—I'm not counting White Hound, a unique variant of the default Tiger monsters. You could only get White Hound in Monster Rancher 4 by scanning a DVD copy of Princess Mononoke (or Red Hot Chili Peppers' By The Way album). That's another, what? $30 USD? And I haven't even gotten to all of the other exclusive monsters. And then there's Yokai Watch 2's Local Yokai, which you could only get by playing participating Yokai Watch arcade games in certain regions of Japan. That's right: you had to physically travel across the country to get all the cards with the QR codes for these promotional monsters. Or buy the cards second-hand, which still takes money. It's bizarre how much anger gets levied towards Pokémon because I can point to so many similar issues from other monster-taming RPGs. And I think this really highlights the hollowness of much of the discourse surrounding the titles. It doesn't even invalidate the criticisms, but it definitely puts Pokémon into context. But that's the context that usually gets lost since most people don't look into the genre past Pokémon. That'll do it for this week. It's been a bit since I had a column this long... I stepped back and took a screenshot of the whole column when I had finished writing up the Nintendo Direct breakdown, and it was already long enough to be a column unto itself. That's what they pay me for, babes...! I might actually be glibbed out this time. Be good to each other. I'll see you in seven. This Week in Games homepage / archives

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: CleanSpark: Buy The CLSK Stock Rally Before It's Too Late?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/19/cleanspark-buy-the-clsk-stock-rally-before-its-too-late/
Time Published: 2025-09-19T13:15:23Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CleanSpark stock (NASDAQ:CLSK) has seen a sharp rise, gaining over 40% in the past month. This surge comes after the company reported a 38% increase in bitcoins mined during August, driven by a significant boost in its operational hashrate, which reached 50 EH/s (Exahashes per second)—a critical measure of computing power on the Bitcoin network. The company achieved this milestone in June 2025. The broader cryptocurrency market has also shown strong momentum. Other Bitcoin miners, like IREN and MARA, have posted gains recently. This upward trend has been supported by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates, with further cuts expected—an environment generally seen as favorable for cryptocurrencies. With Bitcoin’s near-term outlook looking positive, we expect Bitcoin mining companies to continue growing. A few months ago, we noted that the initial jump in CLSK could mark the start of a larger rally. Since then, the stock has climbed over 30%, and we still see it as well-positioned for further gains. In the following sections, we’ll take a deeper look at CLSK—comparing its current valuation with its operational performance over recent years and reviewing its financial health. That said, if you’re looking for upside potential with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Separately, see – CrowdStrike: What’s Happening With CRWD Stock? Looking at what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, CLSK stock appears slightly undervalued compared to the overall market, especially considering its strong revenue growth. Cleanspark's Revenues have grown rapidly in recent years. Cleanspark’s profit margins lag behind most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Cleanspark’s balance sheet appears very strong. CLSK stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during recent downturns. While investors hope for a soft landing for the U.S. economy, what if another recession hits? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash shows how major stocks fared during and after the last seven market crashes. Summarizing Cleanspark’s metrics: • Growth: Very Strong• Profitability: Weak• Financial Stability: Very Strong• Downturn Resilience: Weak• Overall: Strong Overall, CleanSpark has performed well across the metrics we’ve analyzed. Given its moderate valuation, we believe the stock still has significant upside potential. When we look at the competition, CleanSpark appears undervalued. For example, IREN trades at 17 times its trailing revenue, MARA at 8 times, and RIOT at 11 times. In comparison, CleanSpark’s valuation is much lower at 6 times revenues, suggesting it could be poised for growth to catch up to its peers. Now, of course, we could be wrong in our assessment, and investors might continue to value CLSK conservatively, especially considering its historical volatility. We think the long-term outlook is positive. For investors with a risk tolerance and a 3-to-5-year investment horizon, we continue to believe CLSK stock could deliver substantial returns. Still, single-stock investing carries risk. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio—a collection of 30 stocks—has consistently outperformed its benchmark (the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000). This is because HQ Portfolio stocks have offered better returns with lower risk than the index, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Bank of America boss Brian Moynihan is finally getting religion on risk-taking — here’s why

Full Content:
Bank of America’s boss may be finally getting religion on risk-taking – and it looks like a possible bid to keep his job, On The Money has learned. CEO Brian Moynihan – who has been notoriously cautious leading the nation’s No. 2 bank since the 2008 financial crisis – surprised and delighted insiders and investors alike as he promoted Jim DeMare to group co-president – positioning him as his possible successor. The reception was joyful partly because inside BofA, DeMare is considered the anti-Moynihan: He’s not from the big bank’s retail banking side, nor is he a lawyer like Moynihan. Instead, he’s a longtime trader who has been running BofA’s capital markets division and its real estate lending business. His elevation as BofA’s possible CEO-in-waiting also looks like the bank’s current CEO is listening to critics both internally and on Wall Street pushing Moynihan to embrace risk taking to juice earnings and a stock price that has lagged the competition. As On The Money has reported, Moynihan, who has led the nation’s second-largest bank for the past 15 years, is known for his wokeness (strict adherence to DEI until recently and “debanking” conservatives over the years including President Trump). He’s also known for a plodding and overly cautious management style. You could argue – as some of Moynihan’s supporters have – that his risk avoidance has kept BofA out of trouble since 2008, which almost spelled its doom. During Moynihan’s tenure as CEO, BofA’s stock is up more than 400% with no major scandal or existential trading loss. True, but consider: JPMorgan, run by Jamie Dimon, is up nearly 700% during that time. JPM uses its balance sheet all the time to win deals, and its balance sheet is among the banking sector’s strongest. Also getting a bump to co-president is Dean Athanasia, head of regional banking, setting up a horse race between two of the big bank’s top executives. Until the unrest began bubbling up this year over Moynihan’s weak-kneed management, Athanasia was seen as the odds-on favorite to be the next CEO. As one BofA insider put it: “He’s the carbon copy of Brian; a retail banker who looks at capital markets as an afterthought. They are literally the same person in different bodies.” DeMare, meanwhile, is seen as a charismatic leader, well-liked by his troops. Moynihan’s supporters say the reason DeMare has been able to outperform — 13 straight quarters of his division cranking out profits — is because the CEO gave him the portfolio to do so. Maybe, but his emergence is seen as proof that risk is in the air at BofA. He’s odds-on favorite for the top job since he provides expertise in capital markets that the bank needs to better compete with JPM. That’s if he sticks around. As reported, Moynihan, 65, says he wants to stay as CEO until he’s 70. Both Athanasia, 59, and the 56-year-old DeMare head large swaths of BofA’s balance sheet. But given their age, they may not wait for Moynihan to call it quits if the right CEO opportunity emerges elsewhere. Other names could make the short list include Holly O’Neill, president, consumer, retail; Lindsay Hans the head of wealth management; and Wendy Stewart, president of global commercial banking. That’s why there’s talk inside BofA that Moynihan might leave sooner than his stated end-date of 2030. “Brian staying until 2030 is like those promises to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,” said another BofA insider. “People keep talking about it but no one thinks it’s realistic. “ A BofA rep had no comment.

Title: Bitcoin’s Big Flip: More Stable Than the Nasdaq 100 as Best Altcoin Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Benefits
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-less-volatile-than-nasdaq-top-altcoins-like-hyper-benefit/

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. There’s a massive shift occurring in the financial world, and it’s a big deal for Bitcoin. For the first time, Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped below that of nearly every company on the Nasdaq 100 index. A cryptocurrency once known for its wild, unpredictable price has now become more stable than giants like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. The data in CEX.io’s report shows that over the past 3 months, Bitcoin’s realized volatility is now lower than 99 of the 100 companies in the index. Just a month ago, it was steadier than 91% of them. It seems the days of Bitcoin’s stomach-churning volatility might be behind us. Exciting developments being brought to the Bitcoin network by projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) further signal a bullish momentum is building for $BTC. With nearly $17M raised on presale and a promise to turn Bitcoin from a store of value into a DeFi-ready ecosystem, $HYPER stands out as one of the best altcoins today. The CEX.io report explains that it’s all about maturity. As Bitcoin’s market cap has exploded, it’s created a much deeper liquidity pool. Basically, there’s a lot more money flowing in and out of the market, which means a single big buyer or seller can’t rock the boat like they used to. This is a significant vote of confidence for Bitcoin, demonstrating its status as a serious investment. What’s even more impressive is that Bitcoin hasn’t sacrificed its returns for this new stability. It outperformed almost all of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ stocks, a famous group of tech behemoths like Alphabet and Nvidia. In fact, among that group, Bitcoin’s gains were only topped by Alphabet. You’re not just getting a calmer asset; you’re getting one that’s still delivering spectacular results. Let’s face it, results are what’s important, and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is shaping up to deliver in a big way with increased speed and development on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin has always been the gold standard of crypto: secure, decentralized, and a rock-solid store of value. But let’s be honest, it’s not exactly built for speed. Transaction are slow and fees get high during network congestion, making it tough to use for daily payments or cutting-edge dApps. It offloads network traffic off Bitcoin’s L1 through a canonical bridge, which securely cross-mints wrapped $BTC ($wBTC) on the Hyper network. While the $wBTC is usable for L2 dApps and DeFi protocols, Bitcoin’s L1 remains the settlement layer. The L2 taps into the incredible speed of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which helps unlock lightning-fast, ultra-cheap transactions and a new universe of possibilities for Bitcoin. This isn’t about replacing Bitcoin; it’s about making it faster, more flexible, and future-proof. Visit the official Bitcoin Hyper website to learn more. The Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem combines Bitcoin’s security and Solana’s speed, making it a perfect combo for the Web3 world where Bitcoin risks being left behind. The $HYPER token is the fuel that powers this upcoming ecosystem, and the project’s promise has drawn in a lot of bullish investors. As the project races towards its mainnet launch in Q3, with top exchange listings following in Q4, $HYPER is poised to become a core part of the Bitcoin universe. Indeed, Bitcoin Hyper’s presale has been a massive success, raising over $16.8M so far. It’s a massive vote of confidence that shows people are hungry for ways to make Bitcoin more useful. With $HYPER fueling network fees, DAO governance, and giving 68% APY rewards to early presale buyers, its incentives and value as a utility token make it an attractive play in late 2025.

For traders focused on events, the situation is straightforward: either position in advance of earnings based on historical likelihoods, or await the announcement and trade based on the relationship between short-term movements and medium-term results. For those looking for a more consistent option, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio —up 91% since its inception—has regularly outperformed the S&P 500. See earnings reaction history of all stocks. Additional data on observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. A relatively lower-risk approach (though not effective if the correlation is weak) is to analyze the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identifying a pair with the highest correlation and implementing the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the strongest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the subsequent 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and the following 5D returns.

Title: Football Manager player numbers are through the roof thanks to subscription platforms like Game Pass and Netflix - series boss Miles Jacobson explains how

Full Content:
"We don't see cannibalisation..." "It was five, six years ago we celebrated two million players for the first time," Miles Jacobson tells me, during our lengthy interview with the studio head at Football Manager developer Sports Interactive's office earlier this summer. Checking that reference, it was indeed 2020 when the studio first announced that figure, with some pride. "And then we've really embraced the subscription platforms…" Those platforms - Xbox Game Pass, PS Plus, Apple Arcade, Netflix and more - have had a marked effect on the series. From 2 million players in 2020, the series' playerbase has skyrocketed. "As I sit here today," Jacobson says, in the late summer, "and because I haven't been on social media these numbers haven't been [publicly] updated for a long time, so I'm glad you're sitting down - as of when I last checked, we're at 19.09 million players. Of which, 7.5 million have played for more than five hours. If you play a game for more than five hours, you tend to play for a lot longer." Of those, 2 million people played the game in the month of June alone, Jacobson goes on. "That's for a game that has been out since November 2023." While going through the figures, Jacobson brings up a dashboard on the giant screen he has in his office. Total playtime: 1.7bn hours, for FM24 alone. Average playtime: 118.8 hours, "including all the people that have subscribed and played for an hour and then not come back." Without those, that figure's in the many hundreds. And then the one that stood out the most to me: FM24, as of late this summer, actually had slightly more regular daily players than when it first came out. Two years after release, with no FM25 after that game's shock cancellation and no additional, official updates or data patches to fill the gap, FM24 is effectively bigger than it's ever been. "We have nine times as many players; we have two and a half times the revenue," Jacobson says, before adding quite understandably: "So we're really happy with the partnerships." Those kinds of partnerships have been in the spotlight of late. Back in July, for instance, Arkane Studios founder Raphael Colantonio called Game Pass the "elephant in the room" of the conversation around Xbox parent company Microsoft's large-scale layoffs. He referred to it then as an "unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidised by 'infinite money', but at some point reality has to hit." He added, "I don't think it can co-exist with other models, they'll either kill everyone else, or give up." The sentiment has some backing - in a continued conversation on X with Michael Douse, director of publishing at Baldur's Gate 3 studio Larian, who broadly echoed those points, Colantonio continued: "I'm fed up with all the bs they fed us at first like 'don't worry, it doesn't impact the sales', only to admit years later that it totally does." It all makes for interesting context for Football Manager's huge success, something Jacobson attributes quite directly to subscriptions. FM is a relatively unique series of course, in that it's annualised, has theoretically different audience to 'core' games, and is available on such a wide array of platforms, from PC and consoles to tablets and mobile. Nevertheless, Jacobson says there are specific things the studio has done to ensure its success on subscription services. "We built a whole business model around it," he says. "You can't just turn around and do this - this was before we launched on the subscription platforms, we'd been talking about it. And we'd been working out what we were going to do for five years - it was a five-year journey before we went with the first experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we learned from those experiments, and that's when the full strategy was put in place." Part of that strategy is in building up what Jacobson called a "long-term addressable audience". In other words: those players who play the game for more than five hours. Essentially they become a kind of insurance against subscription revenue suddenly going away. "If the platforms decided they didn't want us anymore, we would know that we have a lot more consumers to talk to," Jacobson explains. As for that revenue, the specifics of the deals these kinds of platforms make with publishers and developers are quite heavily guarded, but Jacobson could speak broadly to how that worked - how, for instance, does getting nine times more players in a game like Football Manager equate to 2.5 times the revenue, when the games don't include any real in-game microtransactions for those extra players to spend on? "Different platforms work in different ways," he says. "Some of them work in a world of up-front fees and royalties. Some of them work in a way of royalties. Those royalties are different for different platforms, so some are based on eyeballs, some are based on playtimes… So what Epic does with their free weeks is very different to what Microsoft does with Game Pass, very different to what Apple Arcade does. Which is very different to what Amazon Prime Days do, which is very different to what Netflix does." An extra upside comes "if your sales don't drop," Jacobson adds, meaning a studio such as Sports Interactive gets the revenue from the royalties and revenue from sales of the games they would've always had. "We don't see cannibalisation, which is an absolute key thing. But we work with a publisher that we've worked with for a long time, who happens to own us as well, who understands the nature of annual iterations." The studio also has a five-year plan, Jacobson says, and publisher Sega its own 10-year plans, which factor in the timing for when certain deals might run out. "We know when our deals are going to run out with these platforms," Jacobson says. "If we can get a deal that makes sense for us, then we will do the deal that makes sense. If we don't… we know how many customers have played for more than five hours, so we know what our target number is going to be to hit that year. So it actually helps us, being able to be in a - I can't say fully 'no-lose' situation - but in most cases we're in a no-lose situation." All that has left Jacobson almost unanimously positive about the services, at least in terms of how they've worked for Football Manager. "We'd love to stay with the partners, we work very, very well together, and it's massively increased our audience - but I don't control their businesses, and with any large business they can pivot, so we've protected ourselves from that, and that's why it was so important to do that long-term plan first." As for that painfully protracted wave of layoffs, Jacobson put much of the industry's difficulty down to games' increasing competition for attention: "We are in the middle of a battle for eyeballs." "We are not just battling time for other games," he adds. "We're also battling for the time of people watching TV, people watching YouTube, music, videos - games are battling with streamers over eyeballs, because there's only one set of eyeballs. It all ties into the same thing… you have games like ours that have huge playtime. You have games like Candy Crush or Clash Royale, but also games like Destiny that have huge, huge playtimes, and we've seen a lot more of those coming through." All of those games, he goes on, "are battling against everything else. Plus there are more games coming out now than there've ever been before. Literally thousands of games coming out each month. Not everything can survive. So the subscription platforms are part of it, but the whole market is part of it as well." Likewise, he adds, "you have to be realistic about the situation, which is: if there aren't enough hours in the day for the games to be played, then there are games that aren't going to be able to be made. That's the reality, in my opinion, of what people have been going through the last few years… I think people probably realised there's just too many games coming out, they can't all be successful. And the budgets have gone up so much - budgets have gone up exponentially - so you have to sell a lot more than you had to sell five years ago to have a hit game. So it's a perfect storm." That ultimately comes back to Jacobson and the team's five- and ten-year plans - something which might insulate Football Manager as a series more than other games from the "infinite money" concerns raised above. "We've got my COO, we've got the comms team, we've got the finance team, we've got the BI team, and we've got the whole of Sega that we worked with to agree on that long-term plan," Jacobson says. "And then I ruined it all by not releasing FM25."

Title: Artists are losing work, wages, and hope as bosses and clients embrace AI

Time Published: 2025-09-19T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
After the launch of ChatGPT sparked the generative AI boom in Silicon Valley in late 2022, it was mere months before OpenAI turned to selling the software as an automation product for businesses. (It was first called Team, then Enterprise.) And it wasn’t long after that before it became clear that the jobs managers were likeliest to automate successfully weren’t the dull, dirty, and dangerous ones that futurists might have hoped: It was, largely, creative work that companies set their sights on. After all, enterprise clients soon realized that the output of most AI systems was too unreliable and too frequently incorrect to be counted on for jobs that demand accuracy. But creative work was another story. As a result, some of the workers that have been most impacted by clients and bosses embracing AI have been in creative fields like art, graphic design, and illustration. Since the LLMs trained and sold by tech companies have ingested countless illustrations, photos, and works of art (without the artists’ permission), AI products offered by Midjourney, OpenAI, and Google can recreate images and designs tailored to a clients’ needs at rates much cheaper than hiring a human artist. The work will necessarily not be original, and as of now it’s not legal to copyright AI-generated art, but in many contexts, a corporate client will deem it passable—especially for its non-public-facing needs. This is why you’ll hear artists talk about the “good enough” principle. Creative workers aren’t typically worried that AI systems are so good they’ll be rendered obsolete as artists, or that AI-generated work will be better than theirs. Their fear is that clients, managers, and even consumers will deem AI art “good enough” as the companies that produce it push down their wages and corrode their ability to earn a living. (There is a clear parallel to the Luddites here, who were skilled technicians and clothmakers who weren’t worried about technology surpassing their skill, but the way factory owners used it to make cheaper, lower-quality goods that drove down prices.) Sadly, this seems to be exactly what’s been happening, at least according to the available anecdata. I’ve received so many stories from artists about declining work offers, disappearing clients, and gigs drying up altogether, that it’s clear a change is afoot, and that many artists, illustrators, and graphic designers have seen their livelihoods impacted for the worse. And it’s not just wages. Corporate AI products are inflicting an assault on visual arts workers’ sense of identity and self-worth, as well as their material stability. As with translators, the subject of the last installment of AI Killed My Job, there’s a widespread sense that AI companies are undermining a crucial pillar of what makes us human; our capacity to create and share art. Some of these stories, I will warn you, are very hard to read—to the extent that this is a content warning for descriptions of suicidal ideation. All, I think, help us better understand how AI is impacting the arts and the visual arts industry. A sincere thanks to everyone who wrote in and shared their stories. “I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing,” as the from SF author Joanna Maciejewska memorably put it, “not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.” These stories show what happens when it’s the other way around. A quick note before we proceed: Soliciting, curating, and editing these stories, as well as producing them, is a time-consuming endeavor. I can only do this work thanks to readers who chip in $6 a month, or $60 a year—the cost of a decent cup of coffee, or a coffee table book, respectively. If you find value in it, and you’re able, please consider upgrading to a paid subscription. I would love to expand the scope and reach of this work. Many thanks, and onward. Edited by Mike Pearl. ﻿I work in the field of constructing costumes for live entertainment: theater, film/TV, ballet/opera, touring performers, etc. Budget and scale is all over the map, from low-budget storefront theater in which one person designs and secures costumes for a production, up to a big-budget Broadway spectacular, which can have a dozen people on the design team alone and literally hundreds of makers creating the costumes from designs developed by the design team. I’m seeing this happen typically on the low-budget to midrange end—community theater/high school theater, independent film, etc.: Producers and directors eliminating the position of costume designer in favor of AI image generation. It comes up often in professional forums in the field, someone will share the AI generated costume “designs” and they will be literally impossible to construct for an actual human with materials available in the actual world—gravity-defying materials on pornographically cartoon bodies, etc. -Rachel E. Pollock I remember reading about the new stage of generative AI engines sometime in late 2022 in the NY Times, and seeing Dall-E and Midjourney's outputs and knowing it will mean trouble. Until then AI was making laughable 'art.' Really bad stuff. But all of a sudden the engines had leveled up. I have been working in the comics and publishing industry for over 20 years, but the majority of my income was usually coming from work with advertising agencies. Whenever they needed to present an idea to a client I would come in and help with illustrations, and sometimes storyboards, this was all internal and would never be published, but it was still great to get paid for doing what I love most—drawing. I felt appreciated for my skills and liked working with other people. It was in 2023 that It seemed like overnight all those jobs disappeared. On one of my very last jobs I was asked to make an illustrated version of an AI generated image, after that, radio silence. I had my suspicions that AI was the culprit, but could not know for sure, there was also a general downturn in the advertising industry at the time. Finally I reached out to one of the art directors I work with and he confirmed that the creatives are using AI like crazy, there was no aspect of shame in presenting an AI illustration internally, no one would call you out on it, and it's sure as hell cheaper than using an illustrator. I had to deal with a sudden, very scary decrease in income. Meanwhile it felt like AI slop was mocking me from every corner of the internet, and every big company was promoting their new AI assistant. I was just disgusted with all these corporations jumping on the AI bandwagon not thinking of what the outcomes could be. and additionally, there was the insult of knowing that the engines were trained on working illustrators, including mine! I used my free time to work on a new graphic novel, and eventually leaned into more comics work, which paid (a lot) less, but at least felt more creatively satisfying. The two years following the loss of work were difficult, definitely felt like the rug was taken out from under my feet, and I'm still adjusting to the new landscape, although I feel better about where I am now, I work harder than ever before, for less money. But at least the work will be seen by readers. I'm hoping that in the world of comics the public shame of replacing an artist with AI will hold off the use of the technology, but I'm sure that one day it will become a lot more accepted. I feel like we live in an age where technological changes are happening too rapidly, and are not in any way reined in by the government, and humans can lose their job in the drop of a hat, with no sense of security or help. We are just not built for these fast changes. I'm happy to see people sobering up to the downside of this technology, and hoping the hype would die down soon. -Anonymous I've been out of work for a while now. I made children's book illustrations, stock art, and took various art commissions. Now I have several maxed out credit cards and use a donation bin for food. I haven't had a steady contract in over a year. two weeks ago, when a client who has switched to AI found out about this he gave me $50 out of "a sense of guilt." Basically pity for the fact that Illustrator, as a job, does not exist anymore. It was my birthday recently and I sincerely considered not living anymore.The worst part of all is that the parents who once supported me fully in being an artist sent me an AI generated picture of a caricature of themselves holding a birthday cake with my name spelled incorrectly. I feel cheated, like if I could go back in time and tell the younger me in high school that all the practice, all the love, and all the hope from your parents and friends for your future gets you is carpal tunnel and poverty, I could have gone into a better job field. I'd be an electrician or welder. I have a resume with skills that are appealing to no one, as slop can be generated for free. I sold my colored pencils and markers and illustration tablet on Facebook marketplace for a steal once a previous client who I considered a friend boasted on LinkedIn that AI was the future of cost reduction above an image of a man in a suit who looked like him with six fingers holding a wad of cash. I have applied to over one thousand jobs and I stopped keeping track. My disability didn’t effect making art, but makes me a poor candidate for much else. It was my birthday recently and I sincerely considered not living anymore. The worst part of all is that the parents who once supported me fully in being an artist sent me an AI generated picture of a caricature of themselves holding a birthday cake with my name spelled incorrectly. My friends all post themselves as cartoons online. The person I married had a secret file on their computer labeled "AI pics" they thought I didn't notice. I will wither away eating stale food from the garbage while everyone else is complacent with the slop generator doing what I used to put passion into and finely detail. I don't think it's going to get better. -Anonymous1 I have taught various graphic courses but overwhelmingly Photoshop, the 800 lb. gorilla of the graphics world. I am not a photographer and I do not teach people to take photos, but to manipulate them, also known as Photo Imaging. They are done by manually placing several images into a composite, and then enhancing them by various digital techniques such as layering, blending, masking etc. to arrive at a final result. Most people who take my classes don’t necessarily want to do all that I do, but want to know how to correct or otherwise manipulate photos to create their own projects. I’m turning more to “natural media” (non-digital) art, specifically painting. I am developing a course to teach watercolor painting to adults and I’m quite excited by this prospect. Since the advent of Artificial Intelligence and Photoshop’s version, Firefly, my teaching and private tutoring have pretty much dropped dead. There is very little incentive for people to learn these techniques when they can conjure up an image by text prompts. It takes virtually no skill to do this besides the ability to read and write. I have played around with A.I. for personal projects, with varying degrees of success. Some of it is amazing, and some of it is laughable. However, there is no escaping the reality that these models were trained on existing artwork already online. It’s essentially plagiarism on steroids. Also known as theft. Not to mention the obscene energy costs involved. Had this happened to me 20 years ago I would have been devastated. But at this point in my life (I’m 71) it is not as important as it once was. I’ve had some success both in client work and also creating digital art pieces for which I’ve won accolades. I’ve found satisfaction in teaching but now I’m turning more to “natural media” (non-digital) art, specifically painting. I am developing a course to teach watercolor painting to adults and I’m quite excited by this prospect. I have been married over 50 years and we have never relied on my income to survive. -Susan Oakes I worked in the video game industry, as a 3D artist. In early 2023, when AI image generation was hitting the mainstream, I was working as a temporary contractor at a large games and technology company. I expressed concerns about being able to find further work. He handwaved me, saying "There's always work out there.” I have not been able to find any work since then. Our boss was very enthusiastic about AI image generation, and he showed us how he was using AI to generate some of the textures for the game. I realized that if AI image generation didn't exist, then the company would have needed to hire an extra artist to do that work. I could have recommended a dozen colleagues who were looking for work at the time. It felt like AI was directly taking money out of artist's pockets, and allowing the companies to keep it all. When my contract with that company ended, I did an exit interview with my boss. I expressed concerns about being able to find further work. He handwaved me, saying "There's always work out there." I have not been able to find any work since then. There were several factors as to why there were so many layoffs in games and technology in 2023-2024, but I know that AI has played a role. I miss working as a 3D artist. -Anonymous I am a freelance 3D/2D Generalist. Over the past decade plus, I've had a recurring gig of being hired as a contractor to help create supplemental graphics and B-roll for various documentary-style programs. Everything from infographics about military tanks to 3D animations of prehistoric creatures to recreations of scenes involving historical figures. If you've ever watched any History show, you know the format: footage of the host and experts speaking, then sometimes video clips or photographs, and then typically animated content that illustrates the points the speaker is making. That final category was, until recently, made by people like me. That market has completely dried up. My job loss is merely a side-effect of AI killing off studios higher up the chain that each represent dozens more people being put out of work. A couple of years ago, as soon as demos of AI-generated video began to appear, there were almost immediate rumblings that the specific business of creating documentary-style graphics would be disrupted. The logic being that, while the public might reject a feature-length AI-slop theatrical film, the at-home audience for shows about military history or ghosts or aliens might be less-discerning. That theory is now being tested. History Channel is currently airing a season of "Life After People" that heavily features AI-generated visuals, and I'm sure there are more shows in the pipeline being made the same way. We'll see how audiences respond. As much as I would like to say viewers will reject the AI style and demand a return to human-made art, I'm not convinced it will happen. Even if it did, it might soon be too late to turn back. I know that there are studios with expert producers, writers, and showrunners with decades of experience in this exact genre who are closing their doors. That institutional knowledge will be gone. That's probably the bigger point: this trend is not only affecting artists like me, but also the types of companies I contract for. Obviously I lament my own loss of those stable gigs, but my job loss is merely a side-effect of AI killing off studios higher up the chain that each represent dozens more people being put out of work. -Anonymous I work as a freelance illustrator (focusing on comics and graphic novels but also doing book covers or whatever else might come my way) and as a "day job" I do pre-press graphic design work for a screen printing and embroidery company in Seattle. Because of our location, we handle large orders (sometimes 10k shirts at a time) for corporate clients—including some of the biggest companies in the world (Microsoft, Amazon, MLB, NHL, etc.) and my job is to create client proofs where I mock up the art on the garment and call out PMS colors as applicable. I also do the color separations to prepare the art file for screen printing. [H]e instructed me to start plugging in the names of living artists to generate entire artworks in their style and the first time I did it I realized how horrifyingly wrong this actually was. When AI first came on the scene, I was approached by a potential client that was self-funding a mobile game and wanted to commission me to create in-game art. He asked what my standard rate was and then offered to double it if I allowed him to pay in etherium (which I knew nothing about at that point.) I immediately had some concerns, but I'm a struggling artist so I took the gig anyway and crossed my fingers. He then introduced me to generative AI and encouraged me to use it to create game content quickly. At first I was interested in the possibility of using it to reduce my workload by maybe generating simple elements I get tired of painting—like grasses or leaves—but he instructed me to start plugging in the names of living artists to generate entire artworks in their style and the first time I did it I realized how horrifyingly wrong this actually was. After that I resisted and tried to use my own art. He grew frustrated with me pretty quickly and I left the company after less than 2 weeks (I was never paid; he owes/owed me about $1300).` Since then, I have been very outspoken against generative AI and haven't touched it again. I was the moderator for a very large group of children's book illustrators (250k members) and I helped institute and enforce a strict AI ban within the group. While this was mostly a positive thing, there were quite a few occasions where legitimate artists were targeted for harassment over accusations of AI use. Some of them were even driven out of the group, in spite of our interventions and assurances that the person was not using AI. In my own freelancing work, I have now been accused of using AI as well. I like to do fan art from Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern [series], and sometimes when I'm looking for work I will post my art and past commissions in fan groups to see if anyone wants to hire me to draw their original characters based on the Pern books. Almost invariably now someone will ask if my art is AI generated. It used to bother me more than it does now, I'm growing a little numb to it. My coworker at my screen printing job (in spite of knowing my negative feelings on the matter because I had cried after I found several dozen pieces of my art in the LAION dataset) chose to plug my art into an AI generator and asked for it to imitate my style—which it did poorly, might I add. It felt extremely violating. Lastly, in my role as a graphic designer, we often now have to deal with clients sending art files in for screen printing that were generated with AI. It's a pain in the ass because these files are often low-resolution and the weird smudgy edges in most AI images don't make for easy color separations. When a human graphic designer sits down to create a design, they typically leave layers in place that can be individually manipulated and that makes my job much easier. AI flattens everything so I have to manually separate out design elements if I want to independently adjust anything. The text is still frequently garbled or unreadable. The fonts don't actually exist so they can't easily be matched. These clients are also almost invariably cheap, and get upset when they're told that it's going to be a $75 per hr art charge to fix the image so it's suitable for screening. Also, and here I don't have any data, just my personal anecdotal experience, but it feels like some of these companies have laid off so much of their in-house graphic design staff that they are increasingly reliant on us as a print service to fix up stuff they'd formerly done for themselves. I get simple graphic design requests every day by people who should have had the resources to handle this themselves but now they're expecting me to pick up the slack for the employees they've let go for the sake of our working relationship and keeping them on as clients. It's become such a drag on our small business that my boss is considering extra fees. (Which, considering the slim margins in the garment industry, is really saying something!) I am convinced Microsoft does not have any in-house graphic designers left at this point. Okay I joke, but man, it's bleak. I have no way of knowing how many gigs I've lost to AI, since it's hard to prove a negative. I'm not significantly less busy than I was before, and my income hasn't really changed for better or worse. There's more stress and fear, greater workloads cleaning up badly-done AI-generated images on behalf of people looking for a quick fix, instead of getting to do my own creative stuff. And it felt deeply and profoundly cruel to have my life's work trained on without my consent, and then put to use creating images like deepfakes or child sexual abuse materials. That one was really hard for me as a mom. I'd rather cut my own heart out than contribute to something like that. There's a part of me that will never forgive the tech industry for what they've taken from me and what they've chosen to do with it. In the early days as the dawning horror set in, I cried about this almost every day. I wondered if I should quit making art. I contemplated suicide. I did nothing to these people, but every day I have to see them gleefully cheer online about the anticipated death of my chosen profession. I had no idea we artists were so hated—I still don't know why. What did my silly little cat drawings do to earn so much contempt? That part is probably one of the hardest consequences of AI to come to terms with. It didn't just try to take my job (or succeed in making my job worse) it exposed a whole lot of people who hate me and everything I am for reasons I can't fathom. They want to exploit me and see me eradicated at the same time. -Melissa I’m a South African illustrator and designer with 20 years of experience, and in my industry, I saw things going pear-shaped even before gen AI hit the scene. One the main places I get jobs from is on Upwork (one of those gig type work platforms), and I’ve noticed a couple of things: A decrease in job offerings for the illustration I typically do (like book covers). I’ve also noticed a lot more job offers to “fix” an AI generated cover. These authors offer less money because of “the work is pretty much done” attitude. Since Upwork added an AI function to help potential employers write their briefs, there’s been a surge in what I’m pretty sure are fake jobs. The job listings all sound very samey obviously because of the format the ai uses, and the employers have no history on the platform of ever having hired anyone and don’t have their phone or bank linked. So I think what might be happening is that some evil person/persons are creating fake accounts and posting fake jobs so that their competitors waste credits applying for these jobs. -Roxane Lapa I got my start on deviantart, moved on to furaffinity and various other websites. I used to take commissions in the furry fandom drawing futa furries with big fat tits and dicks. In the past year or two my commissions have all but dried up, in the time it can take me to do the lineart for an anthropomorphic quokka's foreskin, someone can just go onto one of a dozen websites and knock something of tolerable quality out in no time at all. AI has ruined a once sacred artform. -Anonymous I am the creative team manager for an e-commerce based company. I manage the projects of 2 videographers, 1 CG artist and 3 graphic designers (including myself).As AI has been getting more and more advanced, our boss (one of the owners) keeps pushing us to use AI to make our images stand out amongst competitors. We have a limited budget, so filming or photographing our products in real environments is difficult. And photoshopping them into stock imagery also takes time. Apparently a 1-hour turn around time per image is not quick enough. Our boss has been going to conferences where he hears and sees nothing but praise for AI created images. How quick it is and how "good" the images look like.So of course he's been pushing us to use this technology. I did tell him that it's going to be a learning curve and to be patient. From Midjourney, to the latest update of Chat GPT, and to Adobe's Firefly. We've been cranking out these partial AI images. The funny part is, A LOT of it still has to be photoshopped together. AI is still not smart enough (yet) to produce accurate images. The products we sell are very particular and even if you feed the AI images of said product, it never gets it 100% right.Our boss didn't believe us so he himself tried it and failed miserably. Despite that, he still reminds us that our jobs will be obsolete and that we have to adapt.Even since we started using AI to improve our images, the turnaround time for listing images remains the same. Though I feel like our boss is waiting for the day to fire and replace my team with AI. -Anonymous As an artist, I thought I was going crazy when it seemed everyone was okay (even enthusiastic) with our work being scraped left and right to build image-generation models. I'm a mom and have a mortgage to pay, so the existential threat to my livelihood caused a lot of sleepless nights to say the least. I have been working in 2D animation for the last 10 years. I'm a background artist, which is unfortunately one of the departments most likely to be hit by gen AI replacement in the animation production pipeline. Of course, there's no reality where gen AI could actually do my job properly as it requires a ton of attention to detail. Things need to be drawn at the correct scale across hundreds of scenes. In many cases scenes directly hook up to each other, so details need to stay consistent—not to mention be layered correctly. But these are things that an exec typically glosses over in the name of productivity gains. Plus, there's already a precedent in which AI was used to produce backgrounds for a Netflix anime. Thankfully, I'm very lucky to work at an artist-run studio that currently appears to avoid the use of AI, so I continue to be employed. My peers who were freelance illustrators or concept artists are not so lucky. I'd say about half of the people I've worked alongside this last decade have left the field (not all because of AI, granted, but the state of the North American animation/games industry is a whole thing right now and AI is not helping). The production I am on currently leverages a lot of stock photos from Adobe Stock. We have a rule in place not to use AI, but some images slip through the cracks. These have to be removed from the finished product because of, I assume, the inability to copyright AI-generated images. An incident happened recently where an AI image almost made it to the very end of the pipeline undetected and wound up disrupting several departments who are on tight submission deadlines. We aren't typically paid overtime unless approved by the studio beforehand, so it's likely that unpaid labor (or ghost hours, where you don't tell anyone you worked overtime) went into fixing this mess AI created. I was running research on [Adobe’s] stock marketplace, trying to understand how customers were adopting the new Gen A.I. tools like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL-E. Internally Adobe was launching their own text-to-image A.I. generator called Firefly but it hadn’t been announced. I was on the betas for Firefly and Generative Fill (GenFill) for Photoshop and ran workshops with designers on the Firefly team. I tested the new tooling internally and gave feedback on Adobe Slack channels and their ethics committee. A.I. generated content started to flood the Adobe Stock website as stock contributors quickly switched from adding and uploading photos to prompting and creating assets with Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Firefly and then selling them back on Adobe Stock. Users wanted a better search experience but it was never explicitly clear if they wanted more A.I. slop, although Reddit forums indicated otherwise. During the GenFill beta, I raised concerns about model bias after prompting the model to edit an image of then president Joe Biden across racial categories and having the model return a Black man with cornrows—without taking into account relevant and contextual surrounding information in the image. The ethics committee pointed me to a boilerplate Word doc with their guiding principles and we had a short Microsoft Teams call, but there wasn’t any real concern from their end. After raising additional red flags inside an Adobe Slack channel about Photoshop’s GenFill beta possibly being used to create misinformation at scale the main response I got was a blasé “Photoshop, making misinformation since 1990…” Long story long, the people internally working on these products really don’t care. In another company all hands meeting about text-to-vector capabilities fellow workers shared thoughts and concerns on the impact of AI tooling to the livelihoods of artists, illustrators and other designers in the Teams chat and no one cared. In another meeting when asked about artist’s rights a manager quipped “In the research from AdobeMAX (Adobe’s annual conference) someone said they were willing to sell their ‘artistic style’ for around the price of a car” when gathering data around AI-style mimicry and trust. The Firefly model still struggled to render hands and certain objects with difficulty and an Adobe company wide email sent to all employees encouraged us to sign up for an upcoming photoshoot on a green screen, holding things like trumpets, accordions, rubber chickens and asked employees to make awkward expressions like being surprised with “mouth open” or squinting while putting your finger in your ear in exchange for a free lunch. Some time in 2023 Adobe paid for photographers to document crowds of people during a concert in Seattle and had attendees sign waivers releasing their likeness since Firefly had trouble rendering and distinguishing people in crowds. Shortly thereafter I was told my staff role was being eliminated. They didn’t let me switch teams. They gave me six weeks to find a new job inside the company and six weeks of severance pay. During the six weeks of “offboarding” as they called it I applied to dozens of internal jobs at Frame.io and other teams like Acrobat within the company and it never went anywhere. -Anonymous I just graduated in June from a two-year intensive vocational program in graphic design. It's probably still too early in my job search for me to say that AI "killed my job," but my classmates and I, as well as students from the class just ahead of us, are certainly struggling to find work. Why I wanted to reach out, though, is to share what my experience was as a student studying design in the midst of the peak years of this AI hype. Basically our entire second-year curriculum in one of our five classes, which was previously focused on UX, UI, web design, etc, transitioned to being largely generative AI-focused. I don't think I'm overstating matters to say that no one in my class was happy about this; none of us decided to go (back) to school for design to learn Midjourney or Runway. Is it always going to be like this? I love learning, but am I always going to feel like I need to acquire skills in at least five new expensive SAS platforms to survive? [One instructor] has lived through and had his career significantly impacted by past shifts in the industry (he was a full-time web designer when platforms like Squarespace came along), so my charitable read is that he wants to prepare us for a lifetime of learning new tools to stay employable. I think the faculty in our program are also hearing from alumni and their technical advisory board that AI tools are becoming more important for local companies (we live in a pretty tech-centric city). So while he's sympathetic, I guess, he's still choosing to go all-in on AI, and to push his students to do the same. In our other classes, AI use was varied. Some of our instructors allowed it; a couple still forbid it completely. I came out of school feeling like... I guess I'm grateful to know what's out there, for the sake of my own employability in this really awful job market. I really feel for designers whose school days are a little further behind them. It's not just AI that makes me say this—in fact, even if things like image and video generators find a more permanent place in graphic arts careers, they're changing fast enough that whatever we learned in school is likely to be outdated pretty quickly. If all the angry posts I see on LinkedIn from more senior designers are any indication, there's been a trend in hiring for a while of companies looking for a designer who also does video, animation, UX/UI, and many other things that aren't really graphic design. Our program taught us a lot of those skills, so maybe, if the current economic circumstances improve, our class might be okay. But it makes me worry a lot for our future. Is it always going to be like this? I love learning, but am I always going to feel like I need to acquire skills in at least five new expensive SAS platforms to survive? Even our AI-booster instructor told us over and over again that computers will never replace the need for creative design thinking and empathy. That, he said, is what we should lean into to distinguish ourselves and ensure our employability. But there are only so many positions out there for art directors, and not everyone who studies design wants to do that. Production design gets looked down on as "menial" by some, I think, but it used to be the pipeline into more senior design positions--and if that goes away, how do new designers even get into the field? And what about people who have worked in production their whole lives? -Anonymous I am a freelancer of a few trades, so it can be hard to measure lost work, because I can also wonder if I'm slow because times are slow, or a typical cycle, or AI. I can tell you this: ALL my "lighter" graphic design work—making social media or print ad graphics, designing logos—has totally dried up. I was actually more worried about this when Canva came out, but even then they wanted my eye and my touch on things, so having the tools to do it themselves didn't really deter people from hiring me. I did this kind of work for some local small businesses, organizations, event venues. This was an abrupt change within the past couple years. They are usually thinking they will pay for a couple hours of my time, when what they are asking for could require maybe 100 hours. The "mistakes" […] are in the bones of the art. My illustration work is mostly picture books, and while my work has remained steady (I do 1-3 a year), the number of inquiries I've gotten from new authors has dropped to nearly zero, when I used to field a few a month and usually book myself out for the next year. Also, through Upwork and other various avenues I find work, I've had quite a few people (presumably authors) reach out to me to "fix" their AI generated art. It does depend on the task at hand but it's a 90% certainty that fixing the art will take nearly as long as just doing it myself. Of course they aren't coming to me with AI generated work because they intended to hire a full-blown illustrator. They are usually thinking they will pay for a couple hours of my time, when what they are asking for could require maybe 100 hours. The "mistakes" AI makes on art for something like a picture book, which requires consistency of a lot of different elements across at minimum 16 or so pages, are so deep that they are in the bones of the art. It's not airbrushing out a sixth finger; it's making the faux colored pencil look the same across pages, or all the items in a cluttered room be represented consistently from different angles, or make the different characters look like they came from the same universe. It's bad at that stuff and it's not surface level. A lot of time potential clients don't know why the art isn't working and it's because it's these all-encompassing characteristics. -Melissa E. Vandiver The title for this story comes from the heading of the email this author submitted. Hopefully, as the bubble bursts, the quality of these outputs will plateau, and people will realize it was all slop to begin with. It’s disheartening how as a society we can go from celebrating paintings made thousands of years ago, studying each stroke, letting them tell us a story and move us, to being satisfied with soulless bunch of pixels and even just putting them in the same category. The point of art, no matter the category-even something as simple as corporate illustration, is that it’s inseparable from the artist behind it. To an extent we can feel the quirks, the struggle and the love in every piece or at the very least the personality of the artist. And that’s what makes art unique and human. No doubt AI art can be beautiful, after all it’s modelled on top of some of the best human art ever produced. But to me, it will always feel like you know when you’re taking a photo of the sunset or the moon with your phone and it never looks right? Those photos never compares to actually standing beneath it and taking the moment in with the sight. Both can impress, sure, but only one is able to make us feel something in our bones. And that’s what AI art will never be able to do for me As a medical transcriptionist, I went through the same story in the early 2000s when speech recognition software became a thing. I went from making good money, to training the speech engines, to being paid a pittance to edit SR-generated text, to leaving the field and having to reinvent myself - at 56. I finally retired because I was making less reviewing medical records full-time as an independent contractor than I would with Social Security, even retiring early. Rapid evolution of technology is more than our society is built to handle. Pursuit of insane profits by releasing iffy tech will destroy us from the bottom up. There are now disclaimers in every medical record to the effect that much of the text of reports is generated by speech engines and ***mistakes should be expected/can occur***. JFC. Oh, sorry the engine said 50 mg instead of 15 mg of drug and your dad died as a result. Whoopsie. No posts Ready for more?

Title: Nvidia announces a new partnership with Intel to work on custom data centers and personal computer products

Nvidia, the world's leading chipmaker, announced on Thursday that it's investing $5 billion in Intel and will collaborate with the struggling semiconductor company. Nvidia said it will spend $5 billion to buy Intel common stock at $23.28 a share. The investment, which is subject to regulatory approvals, comes a month after the U.S. government took a 10% stake in Intel. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called it “a fusion of two world-class platforms” that combines Intel's strength in making conventional computer chips, known as CPUs, that power most laptops, with Nvidia's focus on the specialized graphics chips that are critical for artificial intelligence. “This partnership is a recognition that computing has fundamentally changed,” Huang told reporters Thursday. “The era of accelerated and AI computing has arrived.” Intel shares jumped nearly 23%, its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1987. Nvidia shares added more than 3%. For data centers, Intel will make custom chips that Nvidia will use in its AI infrastructure platforms. For personal computer products, Intel will build chips that integrate Nvidia technology. The agreement provides a lifeline for Intel, which was a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, but fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone’s 2007 debut. Intel fell even farther behind in recent years amid the AI boom that's propelled Nvidia into the world's most valuable company. Intel lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, and expects to slash its workforce by a quarter by the end of 2025. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration stepped in last month to secure a 10% stake — 433.3 million shares of non-voting stock priced at $20.47 apiece — making it one of Intel’s biggest shareholders. Federal officials said they invested in Intel in order to bolster U.S. technology and domestic manufacturing. Of Nvidia’s own Intel stake, Huang said “the Trump administration had no involvement in this partnership at all,” though “would have been very supportive, of course.” Intel's stock price surge Thursday pushed the total value of the U.S. government’s stake in Intel to $13.2 billion, a $2.5 billion increase from before Nvidia's announcement. Huang said Nvidia has been in talks with Intel for about a year. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who joined the press call with Huang on Thursday, said he's been talking to Nvidia since he was named Intel's new leader in March. “This is a very big, important milestone,” Tan said. “I call it a game-changing opportunity that we can work together.” The deal is “bullish for U.S. tech,” Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a client note. Ives said it brings Intel “front and center into the AI game” and, combined with the U.S. government stake, adds to "a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors.” Nvidia, meanwhile, has soared because its specialized chips are underpinning the AI boom. The chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, are highly effective at developing powerful AI systems. Left out of the celebration Thursday was another U.S. chipmaking rival, Advanced Micro Devices. Shares in the leading maker of both GPUs and CPUs dropped slightly Thursday. AMD, Intel and Nvidia are all headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The deal between Nvidia and Intel comes as China moves to be less dependent on U.S. semiconductor technology. This week, Chinese officials reportedly forbade several large domestic technology companies from purchasing Nvidia chips, and China-based Huawei announced that it was expanding its development of AI chips and manufacturing. While Nvidia and Intel will work together to develop new chips, a manufacturing deal has yet to be struck between the two. The potential access to Intel's chip foundries by Nvidia poses a risk to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which currently manufactures the tech giant's flagship processors. Huang emphasized Thursday that both his company and Intel remain “very successful customers” of TSMC. Huang has been in Britain on a visit that coincides with Trump’s trip to the country, and he has been attending events with the president along with other Silicon Valley bigwigs. At a signing ceremony for a trans-Atlantic tech partnership on Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump mused that AI was “taking over the world.” “I’m looking at you guys. You’re taking over the world, Jensen,” Trump said. Huang and Trump also both attended a royal banquet, prompting the tech mogul to dish about the Windsor Castle event to Intel's CEO in the seconds before their press event. “The cognac was excellent, but just not enough of it,” Huang told Tan. “I guess the cognac was from 1912.”
