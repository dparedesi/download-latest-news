The rapid explosion in AI in such a short time has caught them by surprise but it's not unreasonable to assume that they can quickly catch up if they choose to focus on the very high performance, AI driven segment of the market. Nvida is a relatively young company that has made it's way with aggressive implementation of a specialized technology. They do not yet have the full range of resources that some of their competition has.

Title: What Triggers The Next Rally In Nvidia Stock?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Historically, Nvidia has staged multiple powerful rallies - from riding the cryptocurrency boom to capitalizing on the Covid-era gaming and remote work surge. The stock’s latest ascent, fueled by the generative AI revolution that began in 2022 has been the biggest and most transformative wave in the company’s history. In fact, the stock increased by more than 50% within a two-month period on 11 occasions, particularly notable in 2016 and 2024, and rose over 30% during similar times 15 times, including crucial years such as 2017 and 2024. If past patterns persist, forthcoming catalysts could propel NVIDIA shares sharply upward once more, providing considerable profits to investors. Factors That May Elevate The Stock Investing in single stocks can be risky, but there is immense value in a broader, diversified strategy such as the one we implement with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We extend our focus beyond just stocks. A portfolio consisting of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% cryptocurrency, in addition to stocks and bonds, may yield higher returns over the next 1 to 3 years and offer better protection if markets decline by 20%. We have analyzed the data. Current Financial Overview It's beneficial if the fundamentals align well. For insights on NVDA, read Buy or Sell NVDA Stock. Below are several important figures. But How Does The Stock Perform During Adverse Conditions? Examining NVIDIA’s past during market downturns reveals that there remains considerable risk despite its advantages. The stock declined close to 85% during the Global Financial Crisis and 68% during the Dot-Com bust. The sell-off in 2018 and the inflation shock each exhibited decreases exceeding 55%, with the latter around 66%. Even the relatively short Covid downturn caused a nearly 38% drop in the stock. Strong fundamentals are important, but when the market declines, NVDA is not shielded from significant drops. However, risk is not confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions—consider events like earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. Read NVDA Dip Buyer Analyses to explore how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines historically. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising a selection of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a record of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices—the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. What accounts for this? Collectively, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have offered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a steadier performance, as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Earnings Preview: From Disney’s Kimmel Fallout to Paramount-WBD Drama, Our 5 Biggest Questions

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Expect fresh insight into linear and streaming as several big industry shifts are poised to play out over the coming quarters The final round of quarterly earnings updates for 2025 kick off with Netflix earnings on Tuesday afternoon, followed by Comcast next week and Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount and Disney in November. The financials will paint the latest picture on where these companies stand as they look to grow streaming profitability amid linear TV’s continued decline. Executives will also have the opportunity to address several major shifts set to take place across the media landscape in the coming quarters, including increased competition from YouTube, the copyright implications from OpenAI’s Sora 2, Comcast’s spin off of its cable network portfolio into Versant and David Ellison’s new vision for Paramount as the company pursues a potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, which said on Tuesday its fielding interest from “multiple parties” for all or part of its business. “We were finally beginning to settle into a position where Netflix has won the streaming wars. It just feels like things are being thrown into flux again,” Third Bridge analyst John Conca told TheWrap. “We’re in a time of disruption.” Disney, Comcast and Paramount declined to comment on this story. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery did not immediately return TheWrap’s request for comment. Here are five questions we hope to get more answers to as earnings season kicks off. After ending its quarterly disclosures at the end of 2024, Wall Street will be paying close attention to Netflix’s guidance around engagement, which has become the streamer’s new metric of success as it looks to scale its ad tier. Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese told TheWrap that Netflix is finally at a turning point where the company’s ad tier is poised to become a primary revenue driver in 2026. She noted that Wedbush’s quarterly consumer survey indicates “pretty strong stability” in Netflix subscriber growth. “The retention is largely due to their ad supported tier,” she said. “They have the lowest ad delivery rates of anyone in streaming and I think their ads are becoming more and more relevant as they get better at targeting. That will only get better over time.” UBS analyst John Hodulik expects a 17% increase in revenue and 25% increase in operating income as a result of subscriber growth, higher pricing and increased ad revenues. He believes the return of shows like “Squid Game” and “Wednesday,” as well as new hits like “KPop Demon Hunters” and “Untamed,” will provide a boost to engagement and monetization. He expects that trend to continue with its fourth-quarter slate, which includes “The Witcher,” “Stranger Things” and the NFL Christmas Day games. Netflix will also add video podcasts to its platform in 2026 as part of a new partnership with Spotify, so expect to hear some commentary around that. Though Netflix itself has also been floated as a potential WBD suitor, J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth emphasized its “certainly not an acquisitive company” and added that a large, complex deal would “likely bog the company down for an extended period of time and potentially invite regulatory scrutiny.” Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters also shaded big media mergers earlier this month, noting they “don’t have an amazing track record.” Disney will report its first earnings results since its temporary suspension of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on ABC and affiliates owned by Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcasting. The move, which came in response to the late night host’s comments about Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin, triggered calls to cancel Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ subscriptions. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich expects Kimmel to have “little impact” on streaming churn in the quarter given the timing of billing cycles, though she predicted there could be a “modest” impact in Disney’s first fiscal quarter of 2026. On the advertising side, Seaport Research’s David Joyce estimated the Kimmel situation could have resulted in a $4.25 million hit, assuming a $30 average cost-per-thousand impressions (CPM) and 1.77 million average viewers, but acknowledged that could be easily recouped. Antenna revealed on Monday that the monthly churn rate for Disney+ and Hulu doubled in September to 5% and 10%, respectively, though it’s unclear how much of that was related directly to Kimmel. An insider told TheWrap that Antenna’s percentages are higher than what Disney is seeing internally. “Disney ultimately, and effectively we believe, resolved its controversies over the past couple of weeks, but the immediate follow-on with planned streaming price increases might compound the cancellations and put the +10 [million] net adds guidance at risk — but not likely by a wide margin,” Joyce said. Notably, ESPN+ will no longer report its subscriber and average revenue per user metrics starting this quarter, with Disney+ and Hulu set to follow suit in the company’s first quarter of 2026. An Antenna spokesperson told TheWrap that the estimated cancellation volumes for Disney+ and Hulu totaled 3 million and 4.1 million, compared to the averages of 1.2 million and 1.9 million, respectively, in the last three months. Disney+ had around 2.18 million sign-ups during the month, while Hulu had just over 2.1 million sign-ups, per Antenna. In addition to Kimmel, Wall Street will be paying close attention to any additional financial guidance for 2026, as well as commentary around Disney CEO succession updates, its new ESPN streamer and its impact on cord-cutting, the efforts to combine Disney+ and Hulu into a standalone app in 2026, the financial impact of its NBA rights renewal and loss of F1 rights, the outlook for their linear business, recent price hikes at their U.S. theme parks and the impact from competition with Universal’s Epic Universe. Ellison will finally take questions from Wall Street after the closing of Skydance Media’s $8 billion merger as he and president Jeff Shell outline their vision and provide updates on the company’s efforts to achieve $2 billion in cost savings. Those efforts include thousands of upcoming layoffs which are expected to kick off as soon as next week, a review of its real estate portfolio and finding efficiencies in other areas such as procurement and workflow. Leadership also said they would look to transform Paramount into a technological leader in entertainment, with plans to use tools like virtual production and AI, as well as leverage Skydance’s existing relationship with Larry Ellison’s Oracle and move Paramount+, Pluto TV and BET+ to a unified tech stack next year. Additionally the company has been investing more in content, setting new media rights deals with the UFC and Zuffa Boxing, new series such as Jeremy Strong’s “9/12” and Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning’s “Discretion,” and striking deals with“South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, The Duffer Brothers and James Mangold. “It will probably be a few quarters before we really have a good idea of what this vision truly is,” Conca said. “It’s exciting and invigorating that we have seen them make the moves that they’ve made so far, but we don’t know where this might all end up going.” Analysts will also have an opportunity to ask Paramount about its pursuit of all of Warner Bros. Discovery and larger M&A strategy on the heels of its $150 million purchase of Bari Weiss’ The Free Press. When asked during Bloomberg’s Screentime conference, Ellison dodged talk about the WBD bid, but said he sees “a lot” of “actionable” M&A possibilities in the near-term. “We would approach that through the lens of wanting to make more, not less,” Ellison said. Conca says he’ll also be looking for specifics around Paramount’s content spend, how a WBD acquisition may or may not change the plans for holding onto its linear networks and the timeline for ramping up its content production on the film side. Speaking of Warner Bros. Discovery, the company revealed on Tuesday that it has launched a review of strategic alternatives after “unsolicited interest” from “multiple parties” for both the entire company and Warner Bros., its streaming and studios business that will separate from its linear networks business Discovery Global in April. The review comes as WBD reportedly rejected a $20 per share takeover bid from Paramount for being too low. Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield noted that, assuming the lowest price the WBD board is willing to entertain is $25 per share, the Ellisons could pay around $63 billion with $50 billion in cash, though he doesn’t believe they’d be interested in that option. They could also write a $30 billion check for WBD and raise $20 billion in new debt, along with issuing $12 billion to $13 billion of new Paramount stock to WBD shareholders. Additionally, analysts will be looking for any further guidance around HBO Max’s efforts to grow revenue, profitability and subscribers through its ongoing international expansion and looming password sharing crackdown, as well as the impact of WBD’s loss of its NBA rights to Amazon, NBCUniversal and Disney. Though it wasn’t included in the larger group, Warner notably reached a settlement with the league that will give TNT Sports and its portfolio of brands a global license to create, produce and distribute new and existing NBA content across its platforms, as well as international rights in Northern Europe and Latin America, excluding Mexico and Brazil. Morningstar Research analyst Matthew Dolgin told TheWrap it’s too soon to tell what the overall impact of the NBA loss will be, but that it’s an area he’ll be keeping an eye on. “Their recent pay TV renewals should keep the subscription line steady for now, but the extent of ad revenue declines and cash savings over the next couple of quarters will be important,” Dolgin said. Though many analysts have viewed Comcast as an ideal merger partner for WBD for years, the company faces difficulty in getting a deal done given its upcoming spin off of Versant, as well as the required financing for a competing bid against the world’s second richest man and potential regulatory hurdles from the Trump administration. “I would be very surprised if they were to get involved at this point. It seems like Paramount has the appetite to absorb both and then maybe deal with it later. I don’t see Comcast wanting to do that, at least as of now,” Conca said. “If we’re sitting here a year from now and there’s a full Warner Bros. Discovery unwinding and they’re spun off, I could see Comcast maybe getting involved for the studio piece and Versant getting involved for the cable networks, but I don’t see that now as they’re going through their own organizational reshuffle.” On the flip side, Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino believes that Comcast should “try hard to buy it,” arguing it would have “much to gain” and that it could “fix NBCU’s ~$30B undervaluation.” Supino said Comcast could get around the political and financing challenges by issuing new stock to WBD, eliminating its “super voting” share structure and appointing a new chairman and CEO given Trump’s repeated criticism of Brian Roberts. (Comcast recently announced it would elevate Comcast president Mike Cavanagh to co-CEO alongside Roberts, though the latter said the pair would work together for “years to come.”) He added that NBCU could sweeten its bid with a position for WBD CEO David Zaslav in the combined company. Outside of the WBD bid conversation, analysts will keep an eye out for any positive momentum for Comcast’s broadband business, which has suffered declines in recent quarters due to increased competition, and any further guidance that can be shared about Versant’s outlook. In a first glimpse at its financials ahead of the spin off, Comcast disclosed that Versant’s profits fell 16% to $670 million and revenue fell 6% to $3.42 billion in the first half of 2025. They’ll also be paying close attention to Peacock’s growth and how its recent price increase and NBCUniversal’s new 11-year media rights deal with the NBA may impact its profitability efforts. “With the NBA contract beginning in this year’s fourth quarter, I don’t think third quarter sales, subscribers or profits can be expected to be a trend,” Dolgin said. “We’ll need to wait until next year to see if the NBA is bearing fruit and allowing for a better outlook for Peacock, which we’ve seen as the laggard.”

Title: RKLB Stock To $48?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab stock (NASDAQ: RKLB) has seen a rapid appreciation, jumping 41% over the past month to a current trading price of $67. This surge is likely fueled by several positive developments: improved analyst ratings, higher price targets, and new or expanded launch contracts with Japanese clients. A significant factor is the growing consensus among analysts who now see Rocket Lab as a serious, publicly traded competitor to SpaceX. Despite these strong operational tailwinds and the company’s solid long-term prospects, our machine-driven multi-factor assessment suggests reducing exposure to RKLB stock may be prudent. Our primary concern stems from the stock’s Very High valuation. While Rocket Lab boasts a Strong overall operating performance and financial condition, the recent rapid run-up appears to have factored in most of the near-term positive news. Consequently, the stock is currently deemed Relatively Expensive. Below is our assessment: RKLB stock has jumped meaningfully recently, and we currently find it relatively expensive. While this may feel like an opportunity, there is a significant risk in relying on a single stock. Consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Let's get into details of each of the assessed factors but before that, for quick background: With $35 Bil in market cap, Rocket Lab provides launch services and space systems solutions, designing and manufacturing small orbital launch vehicles and satellite platforms for commercial, aerospace, and government customers. This table highlights how RKLB is valued vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Valuation Ratios This table highlights how RKLB is growing vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Revenue Comparison This table highlights how RKLB profitability vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Operating Income Comparison RKLB saw an impact slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We assess this based on both (a) how much the stock fell and, (b) how quickly it recovered. But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are good - think events like earnings, business updates, outlook changes. Read RKLB Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

October 21, 2025 9:00am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Henry Ward, Carta Chief Executive Officer, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in Business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio this Barry Ritholtz: This Week on the podcast. Yet another extra special guest, Henry Ward, is CEO and co-founder of Carta. They’re the company that keeps track of cap tables, compensation, valuation, liquidity for over 50,000 private companies. They work with 8,500 investment firms and over two and a half million equity holders to track all of this crucial information. It’s kind kind of hard to imagine that they were doing this manually with stock certificates before Carta came along and digitized everything and put it all on the cloud. Fascinating company. Fascinating guy. I thought this was really a great conversation. With no further ado, the CEO and co-founder of Carta Henry Ward, welcome to Bloomberg. Henry Ward: Thanks for having me. Barry Ritholtz: Well, thanks so much for doing this. It’s been a crazy week with the UN and everything, so I’m glad you, you guys fought your way over. But I wanna start talking a little bit about your education and background. A bachelor’s in mathematics and computer science from University of Michigan, go Blue and MSC in market finance from EDHEC. I am less familiar with Ed Heck than I am with Ish. What was the original career plan? Henry Ward: You know, I went to University of Michigan originally to be a math major. Technically, my, my degree on my transcripts has a bachelor’s of general studies. ’cause at that time to get a math degree, you were in the literature of Science and Arts College and you had to take two years of a foreign language. And I failed Japanese three times, tried Spanish, failed that twice. And my counselor was, and at the time I was supposed to go in the Marines and they said, look, I said to my counselor, you, I just need to graduate. And they said, well, look, if you switch to a general studies degree, you can, you can graduate. ’cause you have enough credits. It’s kind of a generalist degree. ’cause you took a bunch of math, computer science and linguistics and you can graduate next year. And, and I said, let’s do that. So it was me and 13 football players that graduated with a general studies degree that year. But, but the, my passion had always been math. I thought I’d be a mathematician. My roommate was a computer scientist. He got me into computers and, and then I went into software engineering. Barry Ritholtz: So two questions. First, did you end up in the Marines? Henry Ward: I joined the Marines out of high school as an enlisted man. I, I went to Paris Island and then I later went into what’s called Platoon Leaders course, which is like the Marine Corps version of rotc. I did that. But when I finally graduated, and sometimes I, I regret this, you know, you kind of look back at old decisions and at the time, four years, four more years and the Marines seemed like an eternity. Right now it seems like nothing book of an eye Barry Ritholtz: Would be, it would be gone, right? Henry Ward: Yeah. I ended up deciding to pay back my, my GI bill because this was 2000. I graduated in 1999. My signing bonus paid off my entire college debt at the time, and I decided to go that route. So I, I never Barry Ritholtz: Where was the signing bonus? Where’d you go? Henry Ward: I went to a company called Trilogy out Austin, Texas. And it was an incredibly formative experience for me. I it was a very smart company. They, they were gonna be the Google of the South for a variety of reasons. It didn’t quite work out for them. They, the CEO is still there though, running Trilogy and it’s a great private privately held company. But yeah, that’s what took me into, into Texas. Barry Ritholtz: So I hear you saying you didn’t do well with languages with Japanese, with Spanish, but am I reading this correctly? Did you get your masters, your MSC in France? Henry Ward: Yeah, I did because the, the business schools in France are mostly taught in English. Huh. And English is hard enough for me. So I had to, I had to stick with, with an English business school. The plan was never to go to business school. I, I wanted to ride my bicycle in southern France. It was a big tour to France. Watch here. I loved riding my bike. My fiance now, ex ex-wife was like, well, hey, if we’re gonna go, I convinced her to come with me. We’re gonna be productive. Let’s go to business school while you train for the Iron Man and do all those things. And, Barry Ritholtz: And you did all of that? Henry Ward: Yeah. So we, we, but it was a French business school, so there wasn’t a lot of work. There was a lot of riding, a lot of, a lot of eating bread. It was, it was a great couple years. Barry Ritholtz: That’s a kind of fascinating mix of technical, financial, financial training, Marines and overseas study. How did that experience shape the way you think about building companies? Henry Ward: You know, I, I realized pretty quickly, I, I, I’m not good at the military. My father was an army officer for a long time, and he used to tell me, you know, and the difference between military life and civilian life is in military life, you’re, you’re judged on the, the worst thing you do in civilian life, or certainly in startups. You’re judged on the best thing you do. And, and I’m very much, I do one or two things really well versus I do many things, you know, not wrong. And so I quickly realized the military was not not the right place for me. Investment banking was not the right place for me. I, I went to an investment bank after grad school, and then I discovered entrepreneurship sort of accidentally. And I, I realized this is what I was meant to do. Successful or unsuccessful. This is what I was meant to do. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk about the predecessor firm to Carta second site, a portfolio optimization platform. You launched that not long after grad school. How did that experience influence how you approached the next venture? How did it affect what your plans were for scaling Carta? Henry Ward: The idea for second site was, it was like a wealth front or a betterment, one of these robo-advisors. But you know, Andy and Josh did a, a much better job than I I did, my company failed. And what I, what kind of rose outta the ashes of that was, and I got through the tr of depression after closing. It was, I couldn’t imagine doing anything else as a completely failed founder. I just wanted to do it again. And Carta came out of that experience. And it, it was one of these interesting things where the conventional wisdom for founders is you fall in love with a problem and entrepreneurship is a vehicle with which to that solve that problem. I was different. I fell in love with entrepreneurship. I fell in love with building a startup, and I just needed a problem. The problem was a vehicle with which to be a, a founder. And that really shapes how Carta is today. We’re a heat seeking missile going after any problem we can find to solve to keep the business moving forward. And, and I, I talk a lot to early stage founders about this, is which one are you, are you in love with the being a founder? Are you in love with the problem? And both come with strengths and weaknesses. If you’re in love with being the, in the problem, you know, you’re passionate about the problem, you’ll grind through the, the bad stages of being a founder to solve this problem. The, the downside is if the problem isn’t actually that valuable, you kind of get stuck entrenched in this problem, right? And many founders burn and crash in that. The other side for me is, you know, because I’m not, I’ll do, I’ll work on any problem to, to move the company forward. There’s often not a coherent strategy. It’s like, I’ll grab a problem over here, I’ll grab a problem over there. And, and you can see it in the kind of diversity for, for a $500 million business, we have a, a large number of SKUs and business lines. And it’s because we shoot at a lot of different targets. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk about the initial target. How did you come up with the idea, hey, these cap tables, all the data around comp and valuation and VC investing. No one is really tracking this in a consistent, intelligent way. Like, what was that aha moment? Henry Ward: I was working with Manu Kumar over at Canine Ventures on the, my previous company. And when we shut that down and, and we were talking about what am I gonna do next? He pointed out this cap table problem and, and was like, Hey, this is a real problem. I think you should solve it. Really? Yeah. Yeah. That’s fascinating. I’ll, I’ll invest in it. And, and he, he gave me this, this problem set to go after. And I, I spent a few months working on it and learning about it. What was really interesting was the first version of it was not cap table. So that’s what everybody knows us for. The first version actually was PayPal for equity. It was, instead of, back then you used to mail a paper stock certificate, just like we used to do with the railroads, right? And it cost $50 in FedEx fees and a hundred bucks for the paralegal to print it. Barry Ritholtz: And somebody had to file it in a cabinet. And we were like, we said, Hey, why are we email or, you know, FedExing paper stock certificates, let’s just email it. And, and that was the initial idea. And we realized companies didn’t care that much. We thought the competition was FedEx. They didn’t care that much about it, but they said, well, hey, if you’re, you’re emailing all this stuff, can you just put all of it into a table and show it to me? And we’re like, yeah, we can do that. That sounds pretty good. And that was the thing that had product market fit, was just showing them everything we issued. And then once you had the cap table of the company, my, my heat seeking missile instincts were like, well, what else could we do? And then we launched four nine A and stock option expense accounting and employee management and cart total compensation and QSBS. And suddenly you could do so many things around this core system of record called the Cap Table. Huh. Barry Ritholtz: So fascinating. What was it like scaling that? What sort of technology issues did you run into? How much of the data you were finding? Was it all hand assembled or was there any mass amount of data that made it easy to navigate? What, what were the next few steps ? Henry Ward: I often tell earlier stage founders, you know, being a, you know, we’re about 2000 employees now. The problems I deal with are no different than the early stage. They’re just bigger, faster, harder. But they’re the same, same set of problems. I I do the same thing every day than an early stage founder does. And it’s really simple. It’s talk to customers, figure out their problems, solve the product, build the product to solve their problems and make them happy. And that’s just it. It is just rinse and repeat. Everything else is just, you know, overhead to building a, a a, building a company. And so these days, you know, I’m in New York for, for a few days, half my meetings are our customer meetings. Barry Ritholtz: So this isn’t just obviously public companies. This is public and private companies. How do they differ? My assumption is it’s easier to track and access public companies data. What do you do on the private side? Henry Ward: Public company data and, you know, Bloomberg’s a a great, you know, example of this is, is so ubiquitous and it’s how do we manage this incredible set of data across massive ecosystems and networks in the public markets. Private markets is very different. It’s, it’s private there, there’s no central place to access all this data. We have a lot of the data on what’s happening in the private markets, particularly around venture capital and private equity. But because it’s private, we can’t share it. And that is the very unique interesting thing about what we do is we track all the much of the same data that like a Bloomberg would track, but we can’t share it with anybody. And that’s the, that’s, many people have asked me, Hey, how come you haven’t done blockchain? You know, blockchain seems like an obvious thing for a cap table to be put on. And the reason is our, our customers pay us to fix things when they’re broken. And don’t tell anybody about, tell, don’t tell anybody about it. And blockchain is immutable and public. And that’s, that’s the big difference between private and public. Barry Ritholtz: Really interesting. What was the hardest problem in assembling a private market set of data and cap tables across the whole technology ecosystem? Henry Ward: The big issue we had early was what I’ll call the dematerialization of, of private stock. So the, the model that we think we look at is when Nixon pulled us off the gold standard, he dematerialized cash. You know, now the Federal Reserve could just create cash because cash was now put into the cloud. They could create money, they could do what, they could move money around without actually moving physical inventory. They dematerialized cash and gold and put it in the cloud. And this was in the seventies. We think of us as doing the same thing. Was everything in private markets until Carta was, was cash, it was paper equity, it was contracts, it was PDFs, it was documents. And we dematerialize that. We put it all in the cloud. So now everything could be moved around seamlessly. Getting the ecosystem of venture capital to believe in the dematerialization of private, private equity and private capital was the hardest part. ’cause it sounds crazy today, but in 2012 and 13, lawyers were like, no, but you, you have to have a, a green stock certificate with an embroider around it. Like that’s what we’ve been doing literally for 200 years. I would like, who are you to change this? Barry Ritholtz: I would’ve thought if anybody would be amenable to let’s go from physical paper to digital, it would be Silicon Valley venture capitalists. They were pushing back or their lawyers were pushing back. Henry Ward: The Lawyers are pushing back. But, but even the venture capitalists, ’cause the, the venture capitalists are, they’re very interesting because they are stewards of what the future will be and prognosticators of it, but they’re not users of it. And it’s one of these things I I say a lot about AI is everybody thinks AI will change everybody’s job except their own. And, and venture is the same. Like, oh, you know, all the companies should be using technology, but we don’t because we’re just pros. Barry Ritholtz: we’re the professionals. We don’t need it. Exactly. We’re smarter than everybody else. Exactly. What was the aha moment where that ecosystem that was kind of pushing back said, oh, this is really useful and helpful. Yes, let’s dematerialize, let’s go digital. Henry Ward: It was the grassroots, the the way we got it going was the grassroots efforts of startups saying, Hey, they, they didn’t understand that they were buying into a dematerialization model, but what they understood was, Hey, I can track my cap table cheaper, faster, better on Carta than anything else. And so they just came, came to us. That was the wedge, the net, the kind of the golden phrase is, you know, come, come for the tool, stay for the network. So the tool, the wedge was just better cap table management for one 10th of the cost. And then the network is, once everybody started converging on the cap tables, it became the new standard. So now it’s a weird world, just like, it’s a weird, weird, weird world to say that, you know, know we had paper stocks there to give it and that was the right way to do it. It is now a weird world to say, oh well why wouldn’t we put it in the database on the cloud? Barry Ritholtz: And that becomes a self-reinforcing flywheel. You get a critical mass and then you could go out in, in all sorts of directions from from there. Henry Ward: That’s right. And nobody knows that better than, than Bloomberg and Mr. Bloomberg. ’cause that’s exactly what Bloomberg did. Barry Ritholtz: That’s exactly right. Started with the data… Coming up, we continue our conversation with Henry Ward, CEO and co-founder of Carta, talking about how a simple cap table management became an essential part of the startup world ~~~ Barry Ritholtz: My extra special guest today is Henry Ward. He is the CEO and co-founder of Carta. They help manage cap tables and so much more when it comes to both public and private corporate data. So let’s talk a little bit about this. You start with a simple capital table management kind of unglamorous, but sounds important, essential. Hey, I need to know how many shareholders I have, who owns what, what VCs, what, what employees own, how much stock, like I would’ve thought that was around for 30, 40 years. How has nobody been doing that for, you know, you could practically go back to, you know, the launch of Intel 40 years ago. How has this not been a thing? Henry Ward: The one of the most common questions I got when I was raising money in the early days for this idea was, hey, this sounds kind of obvious. Why has nobody done this before? Right. And I, I, my answer was somewhat cheeky. And I, I always would say, how, how would I know I’m doing it? And you know, I’m the last person in the world that would know the answer to this. You should ask the SE 6.9 billion other people in the world that haven’t done it. Who chose not to, right. Who chose not to. And I’m, I’m a least qualified person. I, I think it’s just one of these inner innovator dilemma problems that the people that should have solved this should have been the investment banks. That should have been the ne the stock VCs. Stock exchanges vc, sure. Maybe even the VCs. Yeah. Somebody, somebody should have solved it, but you know, who’s going to do paper stock certificates? Like it just, it’s so somebody Barry Ritholtz: Had a clerk had to have a clerk or a junior researcher putting this together somewhere and had to realize there was some value to both the firm and various outside startups for, it’s kind of shocking Henry Ward: For sure. But, but the, your, your point so well made, Barry is the kind of person that would be filing paper stock certificates would never come up with the idea of replacing them. And so you, you need this, this is the magic of a, a founder, a visionary founder is, is you need that connection of they, they know enough about technology to, to know what technology can do, but they don’t know enough about the current process that they think it’s unchangeable. And that’s the, you, you know, there’s certain level of intelligence and a certain level of stupidity that you need to get that, that chemical quotient. Right. Barry Ritholtz: So how did you convince investors that, hey, this is worthwhile, this should exist. It doesn’t, please invest in this. It’s worth building. Henry Ward: Most investors said, Hey, the, the even I believe you can build a cap table product and make some money and sell it, but it, the, the market size is too small. How many cap tables can you actually sell? And the, the pitch was, well, hey, this is, this is a two-part story. Part one is win the cap tables. Part two is if you win the cap tables, then we can go build at the time what we called the NASDAQ for private markets. The, the stock exchange to trade the, these, these shares. And our thesis then was the reason why there were many stock market companies before us, but none of them had actually owned the settlement. They hadn’t owned the cap table itself. And so they had to connect, match, and settle these things offline. And by owning the cap table, we could digitize the entire settlement process for these companies. But we, you had to do the hard work of winning the cap table business first. We were wrong. It turned out the cap table business was way bigger than we and investors thought. Today it’s a $350 million business. Wow. But the, the stock market that everybody thought was gonna be, you know, a billion dollar business is zero for us. 00:19:37 [Speaker Changed] That, that’s unbelievable. Yeah. The, you know, VCs love to toss around tam, total addressable market. Again, kind of shocking that people right in the middle of this surrounded by tens of thousands of companies in California and Silicon Valley completely underestimated the total addressable market. Yeah. That, that’s just shocking to me. Let’s talk about the, the income stream you set up in the beginning. This was a fee per stock certificate business. You guys changed this to a subscription model. Tell us about the factors that drove those changes and how it affected the steadiness of your income stream. 00:20:19 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so we, we thought we were competing against FedEx. And so instead of paying $60 to FedEx to FedEx a stock certific, you’ll pay us $20 to email it. It worked. People would pay for it. What was really hard about it though is it’s a transactional business. It’s very hard to, to manage the transactional business. And it was very volatile. And we also quickly realized that we wanted to move to a subscription based business. ’cause we needed to bundle other things that were, were more subscription based, like 4 0 9 a valuations and expense accounting and other services we were doing. But we were, we were two years in and, you know, at the time I think we had maybe 2000 customers that were all paying us 20 bucks. And we realized this was like a, a crucible moment for us. If we didn’t change the business model, we wouldn’t, we wouldn’t survive. 00:21:06 And we emailed all of our customers from me. I emailed all 2000 customers and I said, Hey, I made a mistake. I I priced this wrong for you and I I need to change from the $20 per certificate to, you know, X dollars per year. And, and everybody had a, a price that they, we custom already set up for them. So we didn’t even ask ’em, we just said, we’re moving you starting next month to the subscription model. And it was a very scary, scary thing to do. ’cause you don’t know what your customers are gonna do. Right? You, you literally changed the agreement in the mid-flight. And I, I explained in this long email, I said, I, I made a mistake. If I keep charging you this way, I’m gonna go outta business and I need to move you over to this. And I’m very sorry I made this mistake. I hope I understand if you decide to leave us, but I hope, I hope you won’t. And it was remarkable. We lost almost no customers. Wow. And I, I have some of these saved and framed where customers came back and said, you know, we’re so glad you did this ’cause we were wondering if you were gonna run out of business. Like we thought, you know, this pricing was wrong. It didn’t make any sense making, 00:22:19 [Speaker Changed] So the subscription model allows them to just keep doing repeat business and no one has to track, oh, we did these six companies and it’s however much it is. No, here’s our monthly fee and we can do as many companies as we have to work 00:22:33 [Speaker Changed] With. They, they have a monthly ex annual fee for most of them. They pay annually, they, they renew and based on the size of the cap table at that renewal, they, they just get a renewal notice. And, and it’s interesting, you know, eight years ago we were 10 x cheaper than the lawyers. Now we’re still eight x cheaper than the lawyers. But now it’s, it’s just a different, different world. People are used to software now. And it’s, it’s that, that, you know, 10 years ago is a, is a weird thing for these companies to pay a subscription fee for legal software. And today it’s super, super common. Do 00:23:06 [Speaker Changed] You really think about this as legal software? It, I mean it obviously has ramifications in law, but it really seems more like it’s a combination of hey, it, it’s business, it’s investing, it’s accounting. How, how do you contextualize what space you’re actually in 00:23:26 [Speaker Changed] It? It’s a great question. I I think we started as legal software and people thought of us as legal software. I think over the first five years we transitioned the concept of cap table from a legal solution to a financial solution. So we sort of categorize ourselves in the FinTech world. I think today, when you look at cap tables, our fund administration and fund accounting business, our LP business and all the, the, the software that we sell as a platform into private, private equity, private credit venture capital. I, I think of us now as a, as a software infrastructure business, you know, we, we, we sell, we’re we’re more similar to a NetSuite or even a Google suite than we are to a legal tech company or a 00:24:12 [Speaker Changed] Makes a lot of sense and save on legal fees. So, so back, let’s call it about eight years ago you were called e shares, which kind of intuitively makes a lot of sense. What was behind the rebranding? Why did you go from eShares to Carta in 2017? 00:24:31 [Speaker Changed] The, we liked eShares because it, it was an electronic share, you know, instead of paper. And it made a ton of sense. In 2017, we kind of realized we wanted to do way more than electronic shares. So we knew we needed a new name. We were also pushed on it because we didn’t own eshares.com. We owned eShares inc.com and there was a domain squatter on eshares.com. 00:24:55 [Speaker Changed] What did they want for it? 00:24:57 [Speaker Changed] They wanted, initially I think it was a million bucks when we had, we had $2 million raised total. And then as soon as we raised more money, it became $10 million. Oh really? And so it was just every single time we were trying to get more and we just couldn’t, couldn’t do business. And so we decided we needed to change the name and we came up with Carta and we were able to buy it for I think 75,000 bucks. And it was great. 00:25:21 [Speaker Changed] Wow. That’s fantastic. Did, did eShares ever get sold? 00:25:25 [Speaker Changed] I don’t think so. It is a great question. I don’t know if it’s still, I haven’t been there in a long time. It 00:25:30 [Speaker Changed] Just goes to show you, you know, you have to leave a little bit on money on the table if you try and squeeze every last penny end up with nothing. Exactly. So you guys, I mentioned in the original introduction, Carta serves 50,000 companies, 8,500 firms, millions and millions of equity holders. Starting out with that first $2 million raise, it appears that you’ve scaled from a, a little niche solution to a giant platform for private companies. What was the biggest growth pains in in that scaling that up? 00:26:04 [Speaker Changed] It’s all of them. We scaling a company, I, I think I, I love Jensen at Nvidia and I got to see ’em speak and you know, someone was asked him about would he do it again? And, and you know, he’s one of the most successful entrepreneurs of our generation. And he goes, if I knew what it would take, I wouldn’t have done it again. Really. And yeah, and you know, it’s, I think Mark Andreessen calls it, it’s, it’s eating glass until you, you enjoy the taste of your own blood. So it, it’s, you know, ev every day I, there’s sort of this funny thing where people are like, well what was it like to scale? And I’m like, I’m still doing it. Like, like we’re, you know, and, and it’s, you know, getting in at, you know, 10 o’clock last night from a 4:00 AM start. It’s, you know, talking to customers, it’s hiring, firing, you know, uncomfortable conversations, you know, board mechanics. It’s, it’s all the same. It’s just more harder, faster. 00:26:59 [Speaker Changed] Is andreessen’s quote eating glass till you like the taste of your own blood? Is that accurate? Or is it a little hyperbolic? 00:27:06 [Speaker Changed] You know, I think, so I talk a lot to founders about this, where the, the founders that want to be founders for the money, we all know that the expected value of being an entrepreneur is, is below pursuing a career far, far below the better business bureau 00:27:22 [Speaker Changed] Actually well sold such a large percentage fail Exactly at the gate. So that’s exactly, we all the survivorship bias of, we see the ones that have succeeded. That’s just the top of the iceberg. You don’t see everything below the waterline. A 00:27:33 [Speaker Changed] Hundred percent. And then when you see the ones that succeeded, sort of by definition the ones that succeeded, made it look easy, right? Because it’s like we’re on podcasts doing, doing all of these things. They 00:27:44 [Speaker Changed] Found the right niche, they pivoted appropriately. They built what was needed and the market rewarded 00:27:49 [Speaker Changed] That. That’s exactly right. How hard could it be? That’s exactly right. And and when I look at my history, I know how lucky I got. Like there’s so many forks in the road that, boy, if I had flipped heads instead of tails, I would not be here. And I had, I had to flip, you know, I had to flip tails 32 times in a row to get to, to where I am. 00:28:08 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna, let me interrupt you a second ’cause I just have to share this. So I’ve done oh 550, 600 of these and I have heard that exact thing over and over again. And the first couple of times I heard it, especially from billionaires, I’m like, yeah, yeah, false humility. But then when I start hearing it from more people, from guys like you who are in the trenches chewing on glass, it’s like, and my own experience as an entrepreneur, you really smart and hard work is just table stakes. You really have to get lucky. And people don’t understand how the role of serendipity in, in how things work out. 00:28:46 [Speaker Changed] One, one of my favorite other quotes is Bo bo Durham, the comedians said, you know, don’t take advice from successful people. ’cause it’s, it’s like listening to Taylor Swift say, follow your dreams. You know, or, or the lottery winner goes, you know what you should do, sell everything you own and buy lottery tickets. That’s right. And 00:29:04 [Speaker Changed] That’s an XKCD. They told me I would never win, but I kept at it. That’s right. And here I am today. Exactly. No, it’s, it’s a hundred percent true. Listen, there’s so much more signal in the failures than there are in the successes. ’cause success. Maybe it was skill, maybe it was luck. We don’t know. 00:29:20 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And I, what I try to coach like in my angel investments is it, I call it, you know, the love of the game. And so, you know, you see founders that I wanna be successful, I wanna be a successful founder. I wanna make the money. You know, and, and what I always tell ’em is like, hey, the, the problem with money doing this for the money is most of your journey, if not all, you’re poor, right? You’re seed stage, early stage, you’re just poor. And so if you’re doing it for the money, you, you kind of quickly lose motivation. ’cause you’re poor for years, right? And then let’s say you’re one of the lucky for you to get successful. Well, well now you’re rich. And so if you do it for the money now, now you just, you have no reason to do it anymore. ’cause you’ve got the money and the, the, the people that that, that are successful over time in this business, do it for the love of the game. Like I, you know, I do it because I love chewing glass. 00:30:09 [Speaker Changed] My, you know, my wife and I were having a conversation the other day about when we were poor and I mean really poor. And the really challenging thing is when you’re in the thick of it, you don’t know that it’s gonna work out. You have no idea, Hey, am I gonna get that lucky break? Is the right client, partner, customer gonna come along and and give me that critical mass to go to the next level? So not only are you poor, but the outcome is wholly unknown. And so if you don’t love it, then what are you, what are you doing? 00:30:42 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. You’re poor and you’re, it’s an you’re living in constant uncertainty. 00:30:46 [Speaker Changed] Uncertainty. Absolutely. 00:30:47 [Speaker Changed] And I think what people forget is, you know, I, I’m not poor anymore, but I still live in uncertainty and, you know, I don’t know what’s gonna happen. You know, I’m trying to build a bigger business, you know, and, and the water watermark keeps going up. And so like, if, if in three years the watermark isn’t higher, I I will feel like I failed the last three years. And I, I think that’s the, you know, that’s the essence of being entrepreneur is the watermark keeps going up and you keep going up. 00:31:11 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really quite, quite fascinating. I want to dive into the world of, of private companies and alts, but before we do that, I just had to ask you a data question. My, my assumption is accessing reliable and clean data has to be the lifeblood of what you’re doing. How challenging is that? How many different inputs do you guys have to track at Carta? 00:31:37 [Speaker Changed] I have a perspective on, on software and data businesses that might be a bit provocative, which is, I’ll make this statement that software businesses cannot be data businesses. And the reason is, if a software business has customer data, they get that customer data by selling software and and service to this customer. And if they monetize that data on the other side, if their left hand is, we will keep, keep your data confidential and as part of our software service to you. But then with the right hand they’re selling that data, it cannibalizes their software business. ’cause the customers won’t trust them now ’cause they’re now giving ’em their data. Which is why Carta does not have a data product. We have tons of data. We do not have a monetizable data product. Huh, interesting. We only sell workflow or business operation software. The, the, it’s hard to think of a business that sells actual software and also sells data. I I can’t think of any, even Bloomberg started really as a data data business. The, the non-existent, non-existence of something is not proof that it cannot exist. But my my best example of why my theory that software businesses and data businesses cannot coexist in one company is Salesforce. If anybody would launch a data product, 00:32:55 [Speaker Changed] So funny. That’s who exactly it would be 00:32:56 [Speaker Changed] Salesforce was thinking of. And in 30 years they have not. And I don’t think they ever will. And I think the day Salesforce launches a successful data business, I I will be eating my words and I will be wrong, but I don’t think software businesses can become data businesses. I 00:33:11 [Speaker Changed] I would imagine that, so we use, in my shop, we use Salesforce as our CRM very customizable. And they have specific industries that they, they market towards and and customize. But the moment it feels like your data is being reused, every single one of their competitors would say, we keep your data safe. We don’t monetize the data. Give ’em up on them. Come to us where we respect privacy. I mean, I think the moment anybody tries that their competition is all over that. 00:33:43 [Speaker Changed] And, and you would agree because suddenly you’re now on every list of every vendor trying to sell software to bury and they know everything about you. ’cause Salesforce gave them your data. 00:33:52 [Speaker Changed] Not only that, but it’s not quite hipaa. But the SEC has privacy requirements. Things you’re not allowed to share when you, you’re supposed to know your client. You have all this data. And if one of your vendors is reusing that, repurposing that data for their own ends, like, wait, not only are you violating our privacy agreement, you’re putting me underwater with the SEC, they may come yell at me. I I don’t need that. Totally. I’m I’m gonna go to your competition. Kind of interesting. So, so let’s, let’s pivot towards the private markets. ’cause it’s so interesting. You’ve testified before Congress that’s startups and growth companies backed by private capital. That’s where most of the new job growth comes in the United States. Explain. 00:34:37 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. You know, public markets is, is actually a shrinking industry. You know, there’s fewer public companies today than there were 10 years ago by, by quite a big margin. But the number of private companies is growing astronomically and be, that’s largely fueled by there’s a lot more private capital than there used to be to fund these businesses. And there’s less reasons to, to, to go public now. So I think, I think that will continue to be true. I think it’s structurally true. When I go to the, to the hill and, and talk to our legislators, the, the common response is, well, we just have to push more companies to go public. I, I think it’s like what the, their, their belief is the public markets is a great product for everyday Americans to access growth equity. And I think they’re right. It, it is a good product for it. The problem is it’s not the, it’s a shrinking product and most of the growth is being hap is happening in the private markets. And there are attempts to get these companies to go public so that there can be retail access to them is isn’t working. It’s a little bit like, you know, the river’s coming and you’ve got like one tiny little dam trying to hold the water back. Let, 00:35:46 [Speaker Changed] Let me share a data point that I bet a lot of listeners are not familiar with the US is something like four to 5% of the global population where something like 24, 20 5% of the global economy, global market cap we’re over half. I mean, we are wildly disproportionate in our public markets. How much bigger does Congress wanna make that? I mean, what you’re describing makes a lot of sense. The public markets are enormous. Let’s let the private markets grow and see where they go. 00:36:16 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And that’s certainly the, the, the message that that, that we’re pushing, we still have to solve the problem of, of retail access because as the number of public companies is, is shrinking. That’s less, less and less options for your everyday American to invest their money in their retirement. I don’t think the answer is to try to push more companies to go public. I think the answer is to create safe access for everyday Americans into private capital. And that’s what we spend a lot of time lobbying for in Congress. 00:36:45 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really quite, quite fascinating coming up. We continue our conversation with Henry Ward, CEO and co-founder of Carter, talking about the rise of private company investing. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. 00:37:16 I am Barry Reho. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Henry Ward. He’s the CEO and co-founder of Carta. They help manage the cap tables for tens of thousands of private companies, thousands of investment firms and millions of equity holders. They do a number of other things in terms of tracking, compensation, valuation, liquidity, all these really fascinating issues. So there are a number of companies that bring liquidity to private companies. Sometimes it’s it’s private equity or, or some form of a private fund. Other times it’s individuals who wanna participate in companies before they go public. What are your thoughts on the future of secondary liquidity, both for the investors and employees of startups and for the rest of the investing public that wants to participate in these privates? 00:38:13 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so I am, I think I’m one of the maybe top five people in the world that have worked on private market liquidity. I, I spent the, the last 10 years working on the, on the problem. And I, I’m of the view now that that at least venture startup liquidity will, will never happen. And, and at least a, a secondary exchange in the, in the sense that we think of public market exchanges, the private markets are so different from public, it’s really kind of the upside down world. You know, in, in public markets, the the price is set by the last buyer, not the first in private markets. It’s set by the first and not the last. And public markets, it’s easier to sell one share than a hundred million dollars worth of shares in private markets. Easier to sell a hundred million dollar block than it is to sell one one share. You know, in public markets the distribution outcomes is mostly Gaussian normally distributed in private markets. It’s it’s power law. So all the math that exists to, in modern portfolio finance theory in public markets doesn’t work in private. So it, it is just, it’s a very different market infrastructure. I I think all the attempts they try to create liquidity in the, in the venture world are, are, will be failed attempts. But I hope I’m wrong, I hope I’m just old. I 00:39:27 [Speaker Changed] Mean, equity Zen seems to have figured this out a while ago. They seem to have put together a way to do secondaries for creating some liquidity for, for insiders or employees at companies. But it’s not like they’re a trillion dollar platform. It’s, it’s a little bit of a niche specific focused. And there are other companies like that. I just happen to be thinking of them recently. But really what you’re saying is there’s a gulf between trillions and trillions of dollars in public equity and private stock and, and never the twain shall meet. So 00:40:05 [Speaker Changed] In, in public markets liquidity begets liquidity. And so it centralizes on two exchanges in the US and most regions it centralizes on one in, in private markets. What’s happened is there’s equities and there’s many others. There’s many, many small niche businesses doing secondaries. It does happen, but liquidity does not. But beget liquidity, the, as soon as one of these companies starts to scale, all the competitors come around and they devolve back down to a niche business. And and that’s just the, the, the market structure is that any company that actually starts to scale in their private markets, it actually the it degenerates there. The, we’ve seen so many examples of com of private market liquidity providers, you know, come in hot, get really a quick start and then, and then once they hit scale it falls down. And so you see so many of these small businesses that will always stay small businesses. I don’t think there’s an opportunity for someone to consolidate the market. 00:41:03 [Speaker Changed] There’s been so much focus on privates and alternatives. D does this intensity of interest, does this surprise you at all or you’ve been up to your chin in this for, for a decade and what took everybody so long? 00:41:17 [Speaker Changed] We, we’ve been in this up to up to up to my chin as you say, for for a decade plus. So it’s, it’s not surprising. What I think is really, we’re in a moment of time in the speed that it’s happening, especially with the current administration. We’re liberalizing a lot of the rules for private market access. You know, there’s a lot of work being done around can retail investors access private equity firms? Private credit firms. I think that will continue to happen and I think that’s a big tailwind for, for Carta. And I think the, the, the US economy and and GDP because so much of this capital is being now deployed in, in useful ways. I think that will continue to be true in the next administration. Hopefully they will continue that legislative policy. I think it will, it will be weird in 20 or 30 years, it will be weird that we locked out 99% of Americans out of private capital. 00:42:14 [Speaker Changed] So when I look at who’s being aggressive in terms of moving from, how do we get more people onto the alternatives and private side, it’s everyone from Blackstone to BlackRock, Carlisle, Apollo, Goldman Sachs go down the list. I’m assuming you’re working with some or most of these companies. 00:42:33 [Speaker Changed] We we know them all and we’re we’re huge fans. I I was lucky enough to spend an hour with Rob Goldstein, the, the COO over at BlackRock and, and he was telling me kind of the vision of, of BlackRock and their, their perspective on private markets and you know, he, he made this very salient point, which was, you know, when they talk to their customers, they, they might look at a customer and they, they spend, you know, $25 million a year on public market infrastructure and technology for their public market asset allocation software. And they might spend, you know, 300, you know, $350,000 on their private market stuff. A fraction, a fraction, right? With BlackRock. But they might spend a million dollars total. So 350 k is with BlackRock and 700 K is with a bunch of other vendors. And his team is like, oh, we should go after that 700 k and we’ll win the whole, you know, million dollars that they send in alts. And he goes, no, no, no, no. What we need to do is figure out how to get that million dollars a year they spend in alts to be $25 million a year. Right. And then we’ll capture half of that. And, and that was the, the mental mind shift that I think BlackRock is so smart at, which is we’re trying to grow the market, not not our percentage of the market. Right. 00:43:50 [Speaker Changed] That makes, that makes a whole lot of sense. So they’re looking at an adjacent market to their public market dominance. They’re the biggest investment firm in the world at around $12 trillion. How do you decide what adjacent markets are attractive? And you might wanna enter them if you started with cap tables, you’re doing all sorts of other data analytics. How do you figure out what’s adjacent? 00:44:15 [Speaker Changed] We, we have a really strict framework on it because we spend a lot of our time thinking about where we can expand. And we have really two, two criteria. So one is do we have a a right to win? So what gives us competitive edge that we can do that nobody else can do? And second is, can we, can we win that market quickly? Because we’re very much a software business. Like if, if you can win a market, but it takes a long time. We’re a growth growth company, so it’s gotta be fast. So you have to have a very aggressive customer acquisition model that, that creates a flywheel. That the more customers you get, the more customers you get. And so if those two things are true, we’ll we’ll go after it. And it it, it leads you to really funny things where you wouldn’t actually attack adjacent markets that are obvious adja that have obvious adjacencies. So the example I love is cap tables and four nine A cap tables was a legal service when we entered it done by lawyers. Four nine a valuations was a valuation service done by valuation providers. Nobody thought of them as similar. What we realized is by having the cap table, we could do valuations faster, cheaper, smarter. And so we just started doing valuations. Well, 00:45:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, you know, the tomba number of shareholders, you know what the last transaction or funding was. It sounds pretty basic math, right? 00:45:27 [Speaker Changed] Totally. It’s just math on the cap table. But they’re a completely different industry. So if you think about from a market perspective, they’re different. But you think about it from where we have competitive edge, they’re the same and the same with fund accounting, fund administration, fund accounting software. Very different industry than cap table management. But we’re able to connect the cap tables to the funds and that gave us unique competitive advantage that nobody else could do. And so now we’re in the fund admin business and that’s, that’s our our second biggest business line. 00:45:54 [Speaker Changed] You, you guys also do compensation analytics. How did you find your way into that space? 00:45:58 [Speaker Changed] We realized we’re the only ones that could do benchmarking for both salary and equity for startups. Oh, of course. Nobody else can do it. And so Right. 00:46:06 [Speaker Changed] Without the equity, the salary may not be that significant. 00:46:09 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. But to, to have start at a priority and go, we’re gonna do cap tables and that’s gonna lead us into compensation didn’t make a ton of sense. And that’s the, we have a a a a flywheel of this is how we entered these industries. 00:46:21 [Speaker Changed] You are the perfect person to ask this question. I’m gonna go off script. So I spoke at an event in June in Silicon Valley. It was a kind of funky hotel that was turned into this really interesting space right on the edge of trying to remember exactly where it was about 45 minutes outside of San Francisco. But anyway, it was an employee benefits conference with all sorts of people. And I was there to talk about my book at the time. And I heard over and over again from all these people who, the 401k people, they’re employee compensation consultants, they’re health benefit consultants, all these people who were telling me that there’s this sort of misalignment amongst Silicon Valley employees who were more interested in the dollars than they are in the equity. Which just completely sounds upside down to me. Am I just looking at a weird corner of the world or is that a thing that, hey, you can’t pay your rent with equity. I have to at least make x What do you see out there in terms of how startup employees are thinking about equity versus cash payments for comp? Yeah, 00:47:40 [Speaker Changed] We, we’ve spent a lot of time thinking about this and I’ll, I’ll I’ll frame it. As you know, wealth management financial advice is a well established industry in the public world and the, I’ll call it the liquid world, right? You pay, you know, 1% or half a percent of a UM to your financial advisor and they, they help you manage your assets. There is no equivalent in the private world. Like if I’m a employee and I make, you know, $150,000 a year in cash, but I’m sitting on a million or $2 million of equity, illiquid equity, how, how do I think about that? How, how do I work on it? And there is no industry for that. The financial advisors don’t know how to work with that in part ’cause they don’t understand the, the private market, you know, illiquid asset piece. But also they don’t have, they don’t have any way to monetize $2 million worth of private stock. 00:48:29 You can’t, you know, you can’t charge one basis point or a percent of a UM on it. And so, so we’ve wrestled with this question of if an industry were to be created, not wealth managed but but wealth management for illiquid people for high net worth, but illiquid asset holders, what would that industry look like? And so we’ve been thinking a lot about that problem. And, and we, we recently launched a partnership with Morgan Stanley where we’re last year we posed this problem to them and we said, Hey, we think it’s worth solving wealth management for illiquid holders. How would we do that? And they’re, you know, the largest wealth management firm in the country. They do this extremely well. And now we’re creating a motion to basically help these employees who are like, I would just want the cash ’cause I don’t know what to do with this equity. I don’t know, I don’t understand it. I I don’t know when it’s gonna be liquid. And can you create a financial advisory industry to help those people? 00:49:26 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That, that’s really fascinating. I was genuinely shocked. Maybe because I’m, I’m more risk seeking than risk averse and the thought of equity is so, you know, attractive to me. But I guess when you’re in the thick of it and you’re grinding a hundred hour weeks, hey, I’m working my butt off and I still have to worry about paying my rent. I I don’t wanna go that way. That was the only explanation I could come up with. But it was, it was really quite fascinating. I only have you for a limited amount of time. Why don’t we jump to some of our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests starting with, and you’re a good person to ask this. Tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 00:50:08 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I, I don’t think I’ve had just one. I I think I pulled together a lot of people that have that helped me with little different things. And so, you know, everything from my boxing coach in high school and college that, that, you know, boxing’s an interesting sport ’cause it’s one of the very few sports that if you’re tired and you’re in pain and you have to let off the gas a little bit, it hurts more, not less. And 00:50:33 [Speaker Changed] You gotta dig 00:50:33 [Speaker Changed] Deep. That’s right. And you know, there’s, it’s literally in the corner and you know, from, from perseverance from him, from the marines, from, you know, mark Andreessen who helped me figure out, you know, NetSuite, what we call ERP for private capital at a breakfast to, you know, John Waldron, who I had to got to have a lunch with him, who’s the president at, at Goldman, who explained to me why bankers make more money than I do. And it’s ’cause of the regulatory defensibility. And so you just pick up these nuggets from these very smart people and, and you, you hold ’em as a treasure trove. 00:51:11 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? Are you reading anything currently? 00:51:15 [Speaker Changed] We just read Amp It Up as a, as a leadership team. So we, last month we, we took 60 of our top leaders at Carta and, and on an offsite. And every time we do an offsite at Carta, we pick a book to read and everybody has to read it. And we do a discussion group. And it was very timely for us. We’re, we’re in very much an acceleration mo motion and so, so everybody at, at Carta right now is, is reading Amp It up and, and talking about it. 00:51:41 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really interesting. What about streaming? What are you listening to in terms of podcasts or watching on Netflix or Amazon? I kind of get the sense you’re not a big couch potato kind of guy. 00:51:51 [Speaker Changed] I’m not, I I don’t really watch TV except I have an 11-year-old boy and I recently got him into Arrested Development, which is a classic, classic. I absolutely mean it’s some of the best comedy ever done. And, and we’re watching it together and we’re loving it. And now he, he hits me with the lines and you know, dad, I, I’ve made a huge mistake and we’re having a great time with it 00:52:14 [Speaker Changed] Narrator. It wasn’t, yeah, right. That’s, I mean, that’s where that comes from. People use it all the time, but it all goes right back to, I, I like his podcast, smartless is always kind of fun. Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad who is interested in a career in fill in the blank entrepreneurship, startups, private companies? 00:52:41 [Speaker Changed] You know, I, I just did a talk at Waterloo yesterday to a bunch of soon to be grads there and, and I, I said, you know, they were computer science grads and, and I said, you know, there’s, you know, they know of this algorithm called the Hill climbing algorithm, which is basically, if you’re trying to find a global maximum versus a local maximum. What I mean by that, the analogy I use is, let’s say you’re an a French, you know, you’re climbing in the French Alps as a mountain climber and you’re trying to find the tallest mountain in the French Alps, but there’s cloud cover. You can’t see, you can’t see the tops of these. How would you find the, the highest mountain? And you would, you would do it by picking a mountain, climbing to the top, recording how high you are, and then randomly jumping to another mountain and climbing and recording that. 00:53:22 And there’s all this math around, you know, how many random jumps to mountains do. You have to have to have a 90% probability of finding the global, the global maximum. And I, I say it’s a great analogy for a metaphor for, for early careers, which is most of us unfortunately are taught. You go through kindergarten to high school to college, you pick a career at 19 or a specialty, you then become a, a finance analyst, an associate, then you become a senior associate, then you become a man and you just, you kind of walk this track and you, you never ask the question, am I on a local opt hill or a global optimal hill? And I encourage people early to, to jump mountains to figure out which, which mountain they want to be on. And I think one of the reasons many people my age are very unhappy in their careers is they look back and they realize, oh, I got to the top of the mountain, but it was the wrong mountain. And I encourage young people to, to mountain jump. 00:54:17 [Speaker Changed] I, I, I love that metaphor. Mountain jump is a great, great line. What do you know about the world of entrepreneurship, startups, et cetera today might have been useful 20 or so years ago when you were first starting out? 00:54:31 [Speaker Changed] Idea matters. It matters a lot. ’cause I’ve had a lot of great ideas that did not work and I worked hard, hard at it. I also think there’s this counterintuitive, I guess, thesis that’s happening right now, which is the more entrepreneurs there are, the harder entrepreneurship gets. But people think the opposite, right? Oh, so many’s do, so many people are doing it. I can do too. The number Michael 00:54:58 [Speaker Changed] MOBAs not calls that the paradox of skill, the more skillful players there are in sports, the more luck matters because everybody’s playing at such a high level. 00:55:08 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent. And I think it’s one of these funny things where like, not many people, you know, dream or move to Atlanta to be a hundred meter, you know, sprinter. ’cause I, you know, I think I can be the greatest a hundred meter sprinter in the world. And it’s because there’s not a lot of luck. I mean, there’s luck around, you don’t get injured and all of those things, but like, we pretty quickly can tell who’s good and who’s not good. That’s 00:55:32 [Speaker Changed] Your skill outcome. 00:55:33 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And, and the, it’s a little bit like acting like so much of it is luck that because so much of it is luck. People think anybody can do it and it, it’s actually worse. You actually have to be a super skilled, you know, a hundred meter sprinter and you have to be lucky to do one of these startups. And I think a lot of people are like, oh, you know, a lot of it’s luck. So if it’s luck, anybody can do it. It’s, it’s, you gotta have both. It makes it actually harder, not easier. 00:55:59 [Speaker Changed] I love the expression, table stakes. Smart, hardworking, that’s just to enter the arena. Then you gotta luck. Get lucky on top of it. That’s right. Un unbelievable. Henry, this has been absolutely fascinating. We have been speaking with Henry Ward. He is the CEO and co-founder of Carta, helping to manage much more than just the cap table for tens of thousands of companies, investment funds and investors.

Title: Adobe Stock Pricing Powerhouse Now 38% Cheaper, Buy?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe (ADBE) stock merits your attention. Why? Because it offers monopoly-like high margins at a discounted price. Here are some details. While revenue growth is beneficial, this is not solely a growth viewpoint. Pricing power and high margins yield consistent, predictable profits and cash flows, decreasing risk and facilitating reinvestment of capital. The market typically rewards this. To provide some context, Adobe delivers diversified software solutions globally, including Creative Cloud subscriptions, serving enterprise clients within the Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising sectors. *LTM: Last Twelve Months But do these figures provide the complete picture? Read Buy or Sell ADBE Stock to determine whether Adobe still possesses an advantage that remains robust. Investing in a single stock can be risky, yet there is considerable merit in a more diversified approach. If you're aiming for potential gains with reduced volatility compared to holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) – HQ has exceeded its benchmark, which is a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indices, achieving returns greater than 105% since inception. Effective risk management is essential; consider what the long-term performance of your portfolio might be if you combined 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with HQ’s performance metrics. Here is our criterion for selection: We evaluate stocks valued at over $10 Billion in market cap, filtering out those with high CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. We also only consider stocks that have significantly decreased in valuation over the past year. Below are statistics for stocks with this selection methodology applied since 12/31/2016. That being said, Adobe has experienced some significant declines in challenging periods. It fell approximately 72.5% during the Dot-Com bubble and 67% during the Global Financial Crisis. In the 2022 inflation shock, the drop was around 60%. Even during less severe downturns, such as in 2018 and the Covid pandemic, it still saw roughly a 25% decrease in value. Therefore, despite everything working in its favor, Adobe is not immune when market conditions worsen. However, the risk is not confined to major market downturns. Stocks can decline even when the markets are performing well – consider events like earnings reports, business updates, or changes in outlook. Read ADBE Dip Buyer Analyses to review how the stock has bounced back from notable dips in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks generate superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; it’s a smoother ride, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

This page gives you the inside edge—live updates on trending meme coins, alpha from crypto degens, and whispers from FOMO-driven trading circles. If you’re hunting for the next 10x or 100x gem, you’re in the right place. We update this page frequently throughout the day, as we get the latest insider insights on the best meme coins, so keep refreshing! October 21, 2025 • 15:00 UTC Bitcoin’s resilience, following the October 10 market crash, which wiped out $19B in leveraged positions and more than $450B in market cap, hints at a coming bull run. According to analysts at TD Cowen, Bitcoin could reach $141K by December if the asset regains its lost momentum. Following the brutal market crash, Bitcoin lost 10% in a matter of hours and dipped below $105K over the course of a week. A $141K prediction is more than feasible given Bitcoin’s resilience to such a devastating hit, and thanks to Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) presale, currently at $24.4M. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2 Solution, Hyper aims to enhance the Bitcoin network by making it faster, cheaper, more performant, and more scalable, thereby accommodating institutional investors who require high throughput and near-instant finality. Learn how to buy $HYPER right here. October 21, 2025 • 14:00 UTC Global investment management firm VanEck recently filed an application with the SEC for an ETF that tracks the price of Lido Staked $ETH ($stETH). If approved, it would be the first of its kind in the US. The firm also stated in a blog post that its ETF would give institutional investors ‘a compliant, tax-efficient way to gain Ethereum staking exposure within a regulated investment structure.’ While ETFs, such as those proposed by VanEck, offer investors a way to profit from crypto without owning the asset directly, others prefer to hold their investment directly. These investors, however, understand the challenge of finding promising assets to buy, especially if they’re in the market for the best meme coins. This is where Snorter Token ($SNORT) comes in with its proposed Snorter Bot. When launched, it’ll be a Telegram-based crypto trading bot that facilitates features such as sniping, copying trades, and managing wallets. Find out more about Snorter Token here. October 21, 2025 • 13:00 UTC Tom Lee’s BitMine Immersion continued with its Ethereum ($ETH) buying spree as the second-largest crypto’s price slid over the past few days. The world’s top Ethereum corporate treasury bought an additional 203,826 $ETH yesterday, which brought its total holdings to 3,236,014 $ETH. Lee said in a statement yesterday that with the expected Ethereum Supercycle, the currently low price of the coin represents an attractive risk/reward.’ Like Lee, other crypto traders are looking for alternative digital assets that are promising yet reasonably priced, such as Maxi Doge ($MAXI). The project aims to position $MAXI as one of the market’s best meme coins and dethrone its distant cousin Doge. To date, the $MAXI presale has raised over $3.7M, as it continues to attract fellow degens to the fold. Get the full details in ‘What is Maxi Doge?’ October 21, 2025 • 12:00 UTC Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate to hold Bitcoin, recently purchased 168 $BTC at an average price of $112,051, according to a filing on Monday. The recent purchase brings up strategy’s total $BTC holdings to 640,418 (worth $71B), with an overall average purchase price of $74,010. $BTC prices have been on a rollercoaster since the market crash on October 10th. The OG crypto rebounded to $111K on Monday after falling to as low as $103,500, helping MSTR shares climb by 3% in pre-market trading, just below $300 per share. While institutional giants like Strategy continue to expand their $BTC reserves, retail investors remain cautious amid market volatility, redirecting capital toward promising presale opportunities with strong upside potential. One such rising contender is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — a Layer-2 scalability solution that employs Solana Virtual Machine to bring lightning-fast transactions and cross-chain operability to Bitcoin’s Layer 1. Check out our expert $HYPER price prediction here. October 21, 2025 • 10:47 UTC Binance founder Changpeng Zhao believes that the crypto captain has what it takes to flip gold’s market cap, although it might take some time. Currently, gold is the world’s largest asset, but that is likely to change soon, as the $BTC price soars over the coming cycles. Currently ranked eighth, $BTC has a market cap of $2.2T. CZ’s post also serves as a reminder that the long-term crypto projection looks strong, despite brief corrections. This is further evident from Bitcoin Hyper’s sizzling hot presale, ready to smash through $25M. The project is building a layer-2 solution for Bitcoin, bringing more speed and programmability to the network. Could $HYPER be the next meme coin to explode? Read our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction to find out. October 21, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Elon Musk reignites meme coin manis with his new viral post ‘Flōki is back on the job as 𝕏 CEO!’ His post sent $FLOKI soaring over 20% within hours, causing the token to climb from $0.00006689 to $0.00007456. $FLOKI’s derivatives volume spiked by 663% and open interest rose by 165%, all indicating strong retail speculation surrounding the asset. $FLOKI did not soar alone; Musk’s post helped the entire meme coin market cap to rise by 5.8% to $55.2B, once again highlighting his unmatched influence on dog-themed tokens. FLOKI’s official X account declared it the ‘#1 trending token on CxoinGecko,’ branding itself as ‘Elon’s dog.’ With $FLOKI riding Musk’s viral wave, the newest contender in the block is quietly stealing the spotlight – Maxi Doge ($MAXI). A meme token built on a body-building trading doge that represents gym pumps, raw strength, and the grind of the bull market. Beyond the high-octane meme appeal, the project is already building a loyal community united by its bold ‘crush the charts’ motto. Check out our in-depth $MAXI price prediction here. October 21, 2025 • 10:00 UTC BlackRock just launched its iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) on the London Stock Exchange with the starting price of $11.10. As the official press release states, the goal is to expose ‘retail investors (i) with specific knowledge and/or experience of investing in similar products’ to Bitcoin and other digital assets in a regulated ecosystem. BlackRock’s IB1T is now available in 12 registered locations, including Austria, Spain, Portugal, UK, and Germany. The news is bullish for Bitcoin and could catalyze its Q4 run once $BTC breaks the $120K resistance point again. When that happens, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) may also see visible boost, although the presale is already in full bull mode. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2, promising a faster, cheaper, and more scalable Bitcoin ecosystem, Bitcoin Hyper already raised $24.4M in presale and it targets a Q1 2026 release date if the market is favorable.

Intel (INTC) is set to report third-quarter earnings after markets close Thursday, and traders expect the stock to be unusually volatile following the results. Intel shares are expected to move nearly 10% in either direction the day after this week’s earnings report, according to recent options prices. A jump of that magnitude, based on Monday's closing price, would put shares at about $42, their highest price since April 2024. Alternately, shares could decline 10% to end the week at just above $32. Intel shares have moved an average of 6.5% after its four most recent earnings reports. In July, the stock dropped more than 8% after it reported an unexpected loss and issued a disappointing third-quarter forecast. The last time Intel shares rose on an earnings report was this time last year, when the company touted “solid progress” on its turnaround plan. Intel's stock has surged in recent months, boosted by optimism about the federal government's stake in the chipmaker and what it means for its troubled foundry business. Expectations for a large post-earnings move likely reflect the stock's recent run-up and uncertainty about how recent investments will affect operations in the near term. Thursday’s report will be Intel’s first since the federal government took an approximately 10% stake in the company. That deal with the Trump administration may have been a turning point for the embattled chipmaker, which has since received additional investments from Japanese venture capital firm SoftBank and AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), with whom Intel will partner on custom hardware. During the post-earnings conference call on Thursday, investors will be hoping for updates from executives on those investments and whether they change the outlook for Intel's struggling foundry business The deals have at least been a lifeline for Intel’s stock, which was treading water until rumors of White House negotiations began to circulate in early August. Intel shares have risen 90% since the start of the year, and all of those gains have come in the last three months. Still, analysts are on the whole skeptical that the stock can maintain its recent momentum. Five of the seven analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha have assigned Intel stock a “Hold” rating, while two suggest selling. The average price target of about $30.60 represents nearly 20% downside from Monday's closing level.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs record fourth consecutive day of outflows

Time Published: 2025-10-21T08:16:05Z

Bitcoin ETFs post $40.5 million outflow, fourth straight day of losses. Bitcoin falls nearly 3% to $108,112 as crypto sentiment weakens. BlackRock launches Bitcoin ETP in London amid market turbulence. US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $40.4 million in net outflows on Monday, marking their fourth straight day of negative flows, according to data from Farside Investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was the only spot Bitcoin ETF to register outflows during the session, with $100.7 million exiting the fund. The losses were partly offset by inflows into five other ETFs managed by Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, and Invesco. The latest outflow follows Friday’s $366.6 million and Thursday’s $536.4 million withdrawals, extending a streak of negative sentiment that has persisted across digital asset funds since last week. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs also recorded continued weakness, with $145.7 million in net outflows on Monday — their third consecutive day of redemptions. Bitcoin fell sharply on Tuesday, reversing its weekend rebound as cryptocurrencies lagged behind other risk assets that benefited from easing US-China trade tensions. The world’s largest cryptocurrency dropped nearly 3% to $108,112.30, struggling to maintain the $110,000 level after a volatile start to October that erased roughly $500 billion in total crypto market capitalisation. Traders cited the lingering impact of the early-October flash crash — which triggered widespread liquidations and heightened risk aversion — as a key reason for the muted recovery. Market participants appeared hesitant to re-enter positions amid ongoing volatility and renewed concerns over ETF outflows. Optimism surrounding “Uptober,” a term describing the crypto market’s historical tendency to perform strongly in October, has faded rapidly. Bitcoin is now down more than 2% for the month, underscoring the loss of bullish momentum. The broader crypto market mirrored Bitcoin’s slide, with most major altcoins trading lower. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, fell 5.3% to $3,859.65, slipping below the key $4,000 threshold. XRP declined 2.2% to $2.4145, showing little reaction to the announcement of a new treasury backed by issuer Ripple Labs. Binance’s BNB token dropped 5.7%, while Cardano and Solana shed between 4% and 6%. Among memecoins, Dogecoin fell 4.3%, and $TRUMP lost 3.1%, reflecting a broad-based retreat across the digital asset space. Amid the downturn, BlackRock announced the launch of a new Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded product (ETP) in the United Kingdom, following the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) decision to relax restrictions on crypto-based investment vehicles. The iShares Bitcoin ETP, listed on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, is structured as a Bitcoin-linked security that allows investors to purchase fractional units of Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts. The product is designed to closely track BTC prices while operating within a regulated investment framework. According to The Sunday Times, the entry price for the product will allow investors to buy fractions of Bitcoin for about $11 per unit, providing retail investors with exposure to the digital asset without direct ownership or the need to trade on crypto exchanges. BlackRock remains one of the most successful issuers of Bitcoin-linked products, with its US-listed iShares Bitcoin ETF holding more than $85 billion in net assets, according to SoSoValue data.

Title: $2B to flow into BlackRock’s UK Bitcoin ETF: How UK traders could recycle into IBIT

IBIT wrapper launch in the UK opens a market that could funnel between $1.5 billion and $2 billion into the fund over time. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) began trading in the UK on Oct. 20, opening a market that could funnel between $1.5 billion and $2 billion into the fund over time as UK retail investors gain regulated access to Bitcoin (BTC) exposure. The launch capitalizes on the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) recent reversal of its ban on crypto-based exchange-traded products (ETPs). BlackRock’s US Bitcoin ETF, which launched two years ago and has nearly $65 billion in lifetime inflows, now offers British investors entry at approximately $11 per unit. This is a fraction of Bitcoin’s current $110,365 price. BlackRock reported $17 billion in net inflows to its digital asset products during the third quarter alone, part of $205 billion in total net inflows as the firm crossed $13 trillion in assets under management. The UK crypto market holds an estimated £13.3 billion across 7 million investors, per FCA data from March 2025. An IG report from early October projected the market could expand 20% following the FCA’s policy shift, translating to £2.4 billion to £3.2 billion in new capital, or roughly $3.2 billion to $4.3 billion. Bitcoin products have captured 60.6% of crypto investment flows globally, according to CoinShares’ latest report. Applied to UK projections, Bitcoin-focused vehicles could draw $1.93 billion to $2.6 billion. IBIT’s dominance in the US market, where it commands 75.5% of all Bitcoin ETF inflows since launch, suggests the fund could secure $1.5 billion to $2 billion from British investors. The fund’s structure removes traditional barriers that kept mainstream investors on the sidelines. Rather than navigating crypto exchanges, managing private keys, or purchasing entire coins, investors buy regulated shares through familiar brokerage accounts. The low entry threshold, roughly $11 per unit, democratizes access to an asset that trades above $100,000. BlackRock’s survey data supports aggressive growth projections. The firm expects a 21$ increase in UK adults investing in crypto for the first time over the next 12 months, with Britain ranking third in European crypto investment growth. The company predicts 4 million Bitcoin investors in the UK by year-end. Interest concentrates among younger demographics. IG’s research found 50% of 18-24-year-olds and 49% of 25-34-year-olds would consider investing in crypto via exchange-traded notes. Additionally, 32%of prospective investors cite regulatory oversight and safety as primary motivations, while 19% value the ability to hold crypto within tax-efficient Individual Savings Accounts and Self-Invested Personal Pensions. Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, with 95% already mined, creates scarcity dynamics that amplify demand pressures. BTC’s price grew 120% last year, and is up by nearly 20% in 2025, driven partly by President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance following his return to the White House. The UK government outlined plans last month for a comprehensive crypto-asset regulatory regime overseen by the FCA, positioning Britain to compete with jurisdictions that moved faster on digital asset frameworks. BlackRock’s launch transforms that regulatory shift into accessible products for millions of retail investors who previously faced exclusion or complexity barriers.

Title: Ethereum Whale BitMine Buys 203,800 ETH – Now Holds 2.7% Of Circulating Supply

Ethereum (ETH) treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies today announced that it had bought another 203,800 ETH last week. Following its latest purchase, the firm’s total ETH holdings now stand 3.24 million tokens. According to a press release issued earlier today, BitMine Immersion Technologies, a leading Ethereum treasury firm has further increased its ETH holdings. The firm added another 203,800 ETH over the last week, worth approximately $820 million. Last week’s purchase has increased BitMine’s total ETH holdings to 3.24 million ETH, representing roughly 2.7% of the active circulating supply. In addition, the company holds 192 Bitcoin (BTC) and $219 in cash. The firm has $1.34 billion in combined crypto and cash holdings. BitMine’s frequent ETH purchases have propelled it as the leading public company in terms of ETH held on its balance sheet. Earlier this month, the firm had reported that its total ETH holdings had surpassed 3 million tokens. Commenting, Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine said: The crypto market saw one of its largest deleveraging events ever last week and this put downward pressure on ETH prices. Open interest for ETH sits at the same levels as seen on June 30th of this year. Given the expected Supercycle for ethereum, this price dislocation represents an attractive risk/reward. We acquired 203,826 ETH tokens over the past week pushing our ETH holdings to 3.24 million, or 2.7% of the supply of ETH. We are now more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH. Lee added that he sees Ethereum as a “truly neutral” blockchain which is likely to witness growing institutional adoption. He added that BitMine remains committed to accumulating 5% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. Following today’s announcement, the NYSE-listed firm’s stock BMNR surged an impressive 7.76%, trading at $53.72 at the time of writing. The stock is up an astonishing 640.87% over the past six months. As institutional adoption of Ethereum grows, analysts are predicting new all-time highs (ATH) for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. According to crypto analyst HAMED_AZ, ETH can surge to $6,400 on the back of a new bullish wave. Recent trends show that some institutional investors are even replacing BTC with ETH, due to the latter’s greater flexibility and wider variety of uses. Major asset manager, BlackRock recently shifted some of its BTC holdings to ETH. That said, some analysts are cautious of the trend of Ethereum treasury firms adding ETH on their balance sheets. At press time, ETH trades at $4,019, up 1.2% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: The Jio tariff hike everyone expected isn’t coming—yet
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/reliance-jio-tariff-hike-broadband-ai-expansion-11760857183061.html

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, India’s largest telecom operator by market share, has no immediate plans to increase mobile phone tariffs, belying market expectations, choosing instead to grow revenue by driving users to consume more data. Jio and its closest rival Bharti Airtel Ltd recently removed their entry-level plans to bump up their average revenue per user (or Arpu, a key performance metric for telecom operators), triggering expectations that the telecom operators would increase tariffs towards the end of the year or in early 2026. “We are nudging consumers to consume more and happily pay more, but no immediate plans for the tariff (hike)," said Anshuman Thakur, head of strategy at Reliance Jio Infocomm, during an earnings call with analysts. In the September quarter, Jio’s monthly average revenue per user rose 1.2% to ₹211.4 from ₹208.8 at the end of June, with growth slowing due to promotional 5G offers, according to the company. Following Jio’s decision to remove its entry-level pack, analysts had expected it to both raise tariffs and focus on premium services to close the gap with Bharti Airtel, which leads the industry in terms of Arpu ( ₹250 at the end of June). Airtel is yet to declare its September-quarter earnings. “If Reliance were not to increase tariffs in the next few months, its [year-on-year] Arpu growth for the March quarter would likely be 4% (at say ₹214/subscriber)," J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note dated 19 October. “Investors continue to expect Jio to raise telecom tariffs ahead of the proposed IPO of Reliance Jio (likely by June 2026)." Jio net added 8.3 million mobile subscribers during the September quarter, taking its subscriber base to 506.4 million. At the end of September, Jio had 234 million 5G subscribers, up from 213 million in the preceding June quarter. 5G now accounts for 50% of Jio’s total wireless traffic. Leading tariff hikesWhen telecom operators raised tariffs in July 2024 after a gap of over two years, it was Reliance Jio that took the lead with a 12–25% price hike. But while Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd have been vocal about the need to hike tariffs to increase the return on capital employed (RoCE, a measure of profitability and efficiency), Jio has refrained from openly talking about increasing tariffs. “We (the industry) are operating with the lowest Arpus and the lowest rate per gigabyte. Yet you have to make money," Bharti Airtel’s managing director and vice chairman Gopal Vittal said at an industry event earlier this month, adding that there was room for raising telecom tariffs. In fact, Vittal had earlier called for a change in the telecom tariff structure, by reducing data allowances on some telecom packs and charging for more data. “Though RIL (Reliance Industries) is non-committal on possible tariff hike, management indicated they have other levers like unlimited 5G slab increase, etc., to drive Arpu growth along with the accelerated roll out of FTTH (fiber-to-the-home)/FWA (fixed wireless access)," Antique Stock Broking analysts said in a note dated 19 October. Also Read | Jio Platforms IPO could see another tariff war—to hike telecom rates Jio’s broadband focusJio, during its earnings call last week, said it was looking to add more home broadband subscribers faster. It added more than 1 million new homes each month during the July-September quarter, taking its total fixed broadband connections to 23 million. Jio has set a target of 100 million home broadband customers, with no specified timeline. “The rate for connecting new homes has been increasing and the technology is working well," Thakur told analysts during the call. “A lot of these new connections are being done wirelessly, and therefore the implementation itself is simpler, faster, and we are expecting that we will be able to scale this up quite significantly from where we are today." Jio is leveraging its unlicensed band radio technology—the 5G Air Fibre and fiber route—to provide home broadband internet. Also Read | India talks up 6G ambitions even as its 5G bet is yet to pay off Reliance Intelligence and JioIn August, Reliance Industries chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani launched Reliance Intelligence, the company’s artificial intelligence arm, and announced expanded partnerships with shareholders Google and Meta Platforms for AI applications and services. On the role of Jio’s parent, Jio Platforms Ltd, in this arrangement, Thakur said, “Jio is going to develop its own products and it is going to work with Reliance Intelligence to bring its solutions to the market." Jio Platforms houses the telecom and digital services business of Reliance Industries. Reliance Jio Infocomm is a subsidiary of Jio Platforms, accounting for most of its business. Reliance Intelligence will develop and invest in creating AI products, Thakur explained, adding that this would require a lot of infrastructure and computing needs such as graphic processing units (GPUs). Also Read | Your 5G might soon feel the same in India and the US—thanks to Jio and T-Mobile “Reliance Intelligence is not looking to do its own LLMs (large language models) at this point in time, but (it is looking at) AI-based products and solutions using its own infrastructure, its own people, its own capabilities," Thakur said. While Jio will have an open slate to work with companies such as OpenAI, Meta and Google, Reliance Intelligence will compete with these global tech giants, he said. “This dual structure—RI (Reliance Intelligence) developing core AI capabilities and Jio leveraging them across its platforms—ensures lower incremental investment needs, stronger integration, and long-term cost efficiency, positioning Reliance to monetize enterprise AI workloads and India- specific digital services in the coming years," the Antique Stock Broking analysts said in their note. Jio Platforms reported a 12.8% year-on-year growth in net profit to ₹7,375 crore for the September quarter. Revenue from operations rose 14.6% to ₹36,332 crore. When telecom operators raised tariffs in July 2024 after a gap of over two years, it was Reliance Jio that took the lead with a 12–25% price hike. But while Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd have been vocal about the need to hike tariffs to increase the return on capital employed (RoCE, a measure of profitability and efficiency), Jio has refrained from openly talking about increasing tariffs. “We (the industry) are operating with the lowest Arpus and the lowest rate per gigabyte. Yet you have to make money," Bharti Airtel’s managing director and vice chairman Gopal Vittal said at an industry event earlier this month, adding that there was room for raising telecom tariffs. In fact, Vittal had earlier called for a change in the telecom tariff structure, by reducing data allowances on some telecom packs and charging for more data. “Though RIL (Reliance Industries) is non-committal on possible tariff hike, management indicated they have other levers like unlimited 5G slab increase, etc., to drive Arpu growth along with the accelerated roll out of FTTH (fiber-to-the-home)/FWA (fixed wireless access)," Antique Stock Broking analysts said in a note dated 19 October. Jio’s broadband focusJio, during its earnings call last week, said it was looking to add more home broadband subscribers faster. It added more than 1 million new homes each month during the July-September quarter, taking its total fixed broadband connections to 23 million. Jio has set a target of 100 million home broadband customers, with no specified timeline. “The rate for connecting new homes has been increasing and the technology is working well," Thakur told analysts during the call. “A lot of these new connections are being done wirelessly, and therefore the implementation itself is simpler, faster, and we are expecting that we will be able to scale this up quite significantly from where we are today." Jio is leveraging its unlicensed band radio technology—the 5G Air Fibre and fiber route—to provide home broadband internet.

On the role of Jio’s parent, Jio Platforms Ltd, in this arrangement, Thakur said, “Jio is going to develop its own products and it is going to work with Reliance Intelligence to bring its solutions to the market." Jio Platforms houses the telecom and digital services business of Reliance Industries. Reliance Jio Infocomm is a subsidiary of Jio Platforms, accounting for most of its business. Reliance Intelligence will develop and invest in creating AI products, Thakur explained, adding that this would require a lot of infrastructure and computing needs such as graphic processing units (GPUs).

While Jio will have an open slate to work with companies such as OpenAI, Meta and Google, Reliance Intelligence will compete with these global tech giants, he said. “This dual structure—RI (Reliance Intelligence) developing core AI capabilities and Jio leveraging them across its platforms—ensures lower incremental investment needs, stronger integration, and long-term cost efficiency, positioning Reliance to monetize enterprise AI workloads and India- specific digital services in the coming years," the Antique Stock Broking analysts said in their note. Jio Platforms reported a 12.8% year-on-year growth in net profit to ₹7,375 crore for the September quarter. Revenue from operations rose 14.6% to ₹36,332 crore.

Title: Anthropic Expands Claude Code to Web and iOS for Cloud Coding
URL: https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/2025/10/20/anthropic-expands-claude-code-to-web-and-ios-for-cloud-coding/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T21:55:04Z
Full Content:
AI startup Anthropic is bringing its AI coding assistant Claude Code to the web and iOS, giving developers a way to run coding jobs straight from their browser or phone. The new tool, now in beta, lets users offload tasks like bug fixes, backend tweaks, or documentation updates—all handled in the cloud. Developers can connect GitHub repositories, describe what they need, and watch as Claude codes in real time inside a secure, isolated sandbox. Each task runs independently with live progress updates, and multiple jobs can run in parallel across different projects. When done, Claude automatically generates pull requests and change summaries. The iOS version offers a mobile-friendly way to steer code sessions on the go, though Anthropic says it’s an early preview meant for testing and feedback. Security-wise, all sessions are locked down in sandboxed environments with strict network limits. Git actions go through a secure proxy to ensure Claude only touches approved repositories. Developers can even whitelist domains—for example, to allow package downloads for testing. With this release, Anthropic is clearly signaling it wants Claude Code to become more than a chat-based helper—it’s positioning it as a full-fledged AI pair programmer in the cloud, available anywhere you work. Check out the promo video below: Anthropic has raised billions in funding, with its most recent $13 billion US Series F round in September 2025—valuing it at whopping $183 billion US—led by Iconiq, Fidelity Management & Research, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Key earlier backers include $4 billion from Amazon in 2023 and $2 billion from Google, alongside investors like Bessemer Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, General Catalyst, Cisco Investments, and over 80 others such as BlackRock.

Title: BlackRock launches Bitcoin ETP in London

Time Published: 2025-10-20T21:30:21Z

BlackRock’s latest move brings regulated Bitcoin exposure to UK investors for the first time. The iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) opened strong on the LSE. BlackRock’s IB1T launched on the London Stock Exchange, giving UK retail investors direct access to Bitcoin. The launch follows the FCA’s policy shift, allowing retail access to crypto-linked products. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETP [IB1T] is now live on the London Stock Exchange [LSE]. This marks a key milestone for retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin in the UK. The move signals both a policy shift from British regulators and BlackRock’s growing dominance in the digital-asset investment space. According to data from BlackRock’s official listing page, IB1T opened trading on 20 October 2025 at $11.10, climbing 5.54% on its first day. The exchange-traded product (ETP) is physically backed by Bitcoin. It offers investors direct exposure to the asset’s spot price without needing to hold or custody BTC themselves. BlackRock said the product carries a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.15% per annum until 31 December 2025, after which it will rise to 0.25%. The firm confirmed the ETP complies with UK regulatory requirements and maintains its reserves through regulated custodians. The launch follows the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) decision to relax rules that had previously blocked retail participation in crypto-linked products. By approving products like IB1T, the UK is signaling a more pragmatic approach toward digital-asset investment. This aligns it with the U.S. and European markets that already allow similar instruments. The move also comes as Bitcoin trades around $110,000, recovering from recent volatility that briefly sent prices below $104,000. The renewed institutional inflows from newly launched products could help stabilize BTC’s trajectory and re-anchor market confidence. BlackRock’s debut places it among a growing list of European Bitcoin ETP issuers, including WisdomTree, 21Shares, and CoinShares, all of which operate similar products across Germany, Switzerland, and France. Traditional financial heavyweights are now competing head-to-head in Europe’s maturing digital-asset market, where regulation is fast becoming a competitive advantage. The new listing adds to BlackRock’s expanding digital-asset portfolio. Its portfolio includes a U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETF, an Ethereum ETP, and the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). With the UK now opening the door to mainstream crypto investing, BlackRock’s move shows the growing convergence between traditional finance and blockchain-based assets. The iShares Bitcoin ETP could become a benchmark product for retail Bitcoin exposure in one of the world’s oldest and most influential financial centers.

October 20, 2025 17:30 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the launch window for its next mission for multi-launch customer Institute for Q-shu Pioneers of Space, Inc. (iQPS), a Japan-based Earth imaging company. The mission will be Electron’s 74th launch to date and 16th mission this year. The upcoming dedicated launch, named ‘The Nation God Navigates”, is scheduled to launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand during a launch window that opens on November 5, 2025 UTC. The mission will deploy QPS-SAR-14, nicknamed YACHIHOKO-I for the Japanese god of nation-building, to a 575km circular Earth orbit. This satellite will join the rest of the QPS-SAR constellation in providing high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and Earth monitoring services globally. iQPS aims to build a constellation of 36 SAR satellites that will provide near-real-time images of Earth every 10 minutes. ‘The Nation God Navigates’ will be the sixth mission deployed on Electron for iQPS, following previous successful missions ‘The Moon God Awakens’ in December 2023 as well as ‘The Lightning God Reigns’, ‘The Sea God Sees’, ‘The Mountain God Guards’ and ‘The Harvest Goddess Thrives’ in 2025.

You don't necessarily have to choose between the stocks of two Big Tech giants—but if you must, Oppenheimer has a pick for you. Shares of both Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META), owner of Facebook and Instagram, have been strong performers this year, outpacing the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) and the S&P 500. Still, Oppenheimer's analysts prefer the former's shares to the latter's. On Sunday, they put a $300 price tag on Alphabet, about 18% above Friday's close and the highest on Wall Street, and an $825 target on Meta, 15% higher than last week's finish and below Visible Alpha's analyst average. The Oppenheimer analysts cited what they considered "more conservative" Street estimates on Alphabet, along with a lower valuation on the shares. While the Magnificent Seven group of big tech stocks has outpaced the S&P 500 this year, under the hood there are signs that it might make sense to pick and choose carefully among them. One example: Three of the stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 this year. "While we are positive on the long-term benefits from Meta's push into AI and proven ability to outgrow peers," they wrote, "we are more bullish on [Alphabet] near term, given more conservative estimates and lower valuation." While the Magnificent 7 is running ahead of the S&P 500 this year, it's not surprising that investors might be looking to pick and choose among the group these days: Three of the seven stocks have underperformed the benchmark index year-to-date. More stocks outside the group are lifting the index than in recent years, Capital Group wrote last week, a reference to what's known as market breadth, marking "a healthy move away from the extreme concentration that raised concerns about risks to investor portfolios." "Rising valuations among companies in the index and more clarity on tariffs and interest rate cuts could help lift the U.S. equities market, which has trailed those in Europe and elsewhere," Capital Group wrote.

Title: Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs Available to UK Users via Blackrock, 21Shares, and Others

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BlackRock, 21Shares, WisdomTree, and Bitwise have listed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETPs on the London Stock Exchange as FCA lifts the ban. Top global asset managers like BlackRock, 21Shares, WisdomTree, and Bitwise have opened access to Bitcoin BTC $108 004 24h volatility: 0.0% Market cap: $2.15 T Vol. 24h: $107.10 B and Ethereum ETH $3 841 24h volatility: 0.9% Market cap: $463.51 B Vol. 24h: $45.38 B exchange-traded products that are available to UK retail investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF will be listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), with its shares physically backed by BTC and held via Coinbase. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has already been a massive success in the US, becoming the fastest ETF in history to approach $100 billion AUM, within 18 months of launch. Speaking on the development, Jane Sloan, EMEA head of global product solutions at BlackRock, said: “Built on institutional-grade infrastructure, [the product] enables UK investors to gain exposure to bitcoin with the confidence of robust custody and regulatory oversight.” The development comes 12 days after the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) lifted its four-year ban on retail access to crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs). As a result, this has opened the market to a wider investor base. Apart from BlackRock, other asset managers have also joined the listing race. On Monday, October 20, 21Shares listed two physically backed products for Bitcoin and Ethereum on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). It also includes a staking component for its Ethereum ETPs and a reduced 0.1% management fee for select offerings. The announcement comes as the asset manager also pushes for spot Dogecoin ETF approval in the US. 21Shares first launched its crypto ETPs for institutional investors in the UK last year, capturing 70% of total turnover on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), according to the company. Meanwhile, WisdomTree has listed its physically backed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the LSE with fees of 0.15% and 0.35%. This also follows its earlier institutional offering in the UK. Asset manager Bitwise also announced plans to list its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the LSE on Tuesday, with a reduced 0.05% fee on its Core Bitcoin ETP for at least six months. Back in 2021, UK’s top financial regulator FCA, had banned the sale, marketing, and distribution of crypto derivatives and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to retail investors. With the latest policy shift, retail investors can now access these products through UK-regulated brokers and investment platforms, such as standard brokerage accounts and tax-efficient wrappers like ISAs and SIPPs, WisdomTree said on Monday. The update brings the UK’s regulatory framework closer in line with markets such as the U.S., Canada, Hong Kong, and the EU. However, the prohibition on retail access to broader crypto derivatives remains in effect. Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: $1.2B exits US Bitcoin ETFs just as London makes crypto comeback

$600B in futures inflow could be on the horizon as analysts say Europe’s new ETNs could ignite the next wave of mainstream inflows. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The 12 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETFs) in the United States reversed sharply last week, recording $1.2 billion in net outflows. According to SoSoValue data, this was their second-largest weekly setback since launching in January 2024. The pullback snapped a two-week run of inflows that had brought in more than $5 billion, a period many read as proof of deepening institutional conviction. Data from SoSoValue show that investors pulled capital from nearly every major issuer. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a $276 million outflow, while Fidelity’s FBTC saw $169 million leave. Other major issuers, such as ARK Invest’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB, lost $290 million and $128 million, respectively, while Grayscale’s two funds shed $321 million. The reversal followed a volatile week for Bitcoin, which briefly dipped below $104,000 during the reporting period. Notably, this was its lowest price level since June. Industry experts linked the drawdown to macroeconomic conditions triggered by US-China tariff wars, that shook confidence in risk assets like Bitcoin. However, the flagship digital crypto asset has rebounded strongly above $110,000 as of press time amid recent developments in the market. While US flows turned defensive, a different story that would reshape retail access for Bitcoin was unfolding across the Atlantic. On Oct. 20, Bitcoin exchange-traded notes (ETNs) officially began trading on the London Stock Exchange. This marks the end of the UK’s three-year retail ban on crypto investment products. BlackRock led the debut with its iShares Bitcoin ETP, joined by other leading issuers like Bitwise. Meanwhile, early feedback about these products has been mixed, but they have still shown promising signs. ByteTree founder Charlie Morris said initial trading activity showed “success with platforms such as Interactive Investor, Swissquote, and Trading 212,” though some brokers like AJ Bell were slower to support access. Still, Bradley Duke, Bitwise’s head of Europe, opined that the launch of these products would mark a “big week” for retail investors because the “direction of travel is clear for crypto.” With a new wave of adoption emerging across the Atlantic and renewed institutional focus on Bitcoin, Galaxy Research believes that crypto investment products could attract up to $600 billion in new inflows as traditional financial institutions broaden distribution. According to the firm, the US advisory market represents a vast, largely untapped opportunity that would drive significant flows into BTC. It stated: “Roughly 300,000 financial advisors manage about $30 trillion in client assets. If even a modest 2% allocation to bitcoin ETFs emerged across this channel, that would translate to roughly $600 billion in potential inflows.” These wave of flows would would rival the entire global gold ETF market, now worth about $472 billion, and quadruple the combined $146 billion in assets under management (AUM) across US spot Bitcoin funds. The asset management firm pointed out that recent policy moves by leading traditional financial institiutions like Morgan Stanley and Vanguard support that thesis. Notably, Morgan Stanley recently recommended up to a 4% allocation to digital assets, while Vanguard is reportedly looking to offer select third-party crypto ETFs to its brokerage clients. These developments are expected to drive fresh capital into the emerging industry and further drive Bitcoin’s adoption. Galaxy Research argued that the full opening of large advisory platforms could mark a structural shift in how digital assets are integrated into mainstream finance. Once this access is fully enabled, financial advisors will be able to include crypto directly within traditional balanced portfolios, moving the asset class from retail-driven speculation toward advisor-led portfolio construction. It noted: “The impact could be substantial. New inflows may follow as wealth managers begin allocating to the asset class, potentially pushing total bitcoin ETF AUM to $500 billion within a few years, assuming just a 1% average allocation across managed portfolios. Such flows would reshape market dynamics and reinforce bitcoin’s position as a mainstream, investable asset.” Galaxy’s analysis further suggested that this transition could also bring a more mature form of liquidity. According to the firm, advisory-driven allocations tend to follow longer holding periods and stricter compliance frameworks, reducing the short-term turnover that has defined retail crypto trading. Over time, that discipline could enhance price stability, deepen liquidity, and align Bitcoin more closely with traditional asset classes such as equities, bonds, and gold.

Title: Ethereum In, Bitcoin Out: BlackRock Rebalancing Its Digital Asset Portfolio In Major Crypto Shift

Following the recent market crash due to Donald Trump’s tariff order, the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced a sharp decline below key support levels. While both coins fell strongly, ETH has emerged as the leading choice among major corporations, as these institutions swap their BTC for the altcoin leader. Major crypto assets such as Ethereum and Bitcoin are beginning to recover lost ground once again. Meanwhile, Ethereum appears to be leading the charge in terms of institutional adoption, reflecting the long-term potential of the leading altcoin. In a move that has triggered a frenzy across the crypto and traditional finance sectors, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is reportedly shifting a portion of its Bitcoin holdings into ETH. Coin Bureau shared this institutional pivot on the social media platform X, which has captured the attention of the crypto community. This daring rotation indicates a significant shift in institutional opinion and a rising belief in Ethereum’s sustained price growth. BlackRock‘s shift to ETH highlights the asset’s developing importance as the cornerstone of decentralized finance and next-generation financial infrastructure, even though Bitcoin keeps dominating as a store of value. Data shared by Coin Bureau reveals that the leading asset manager firm transferred about 272.4 BTC, valued at approximately $28.3 million, to Coinbase Prime. A few hours later, BlackRock was observed pulling out over 12,098 ETH worth $45.4 million. Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. has also been accumulating ETH at a significant and rapid rate. A recent report from BMNR Bullz shows that the leading treasury company purchased thousands of ETH within the past week to strengthen its digital asset treasury. Despite the recent market crash, the firm continues to double down on the altcoin, scooping up a total of 379,271 ETH, valued at $1.5 billion. With the massive purchase of Ethereum, Bitmine is demonstrating its conviction in the network’s expanding role in blockchain innovation. During the dip on Friday, Bitmine bought over 72,898 ETH worth $281 million. Three days prior to this acquisition, the firm purchased more than 104,336 ETH, valued at $417 million. Finally, a +202,037 ETH was made after the weekend crash, bringing the total to 379,271 ETH within a week. Bitmine’s persistent acquisition of the altcoin reflects the firm’s Co-CEO Tom Lee’s bold declaration that Ethereum will be the backbone of the digital economy. According to BMNR Bullz, this is not a buy signal, but a seismic shift. Prominent figures in the financial landscape are currently endorsing Ethereum. Robert Kiyosaki, a billionaire and author of the “Rich Dad Poor Dad” book, has included ETH as one of the key assets to hedge against the rising inflation across the world. While inflation keeps increasing and making it difficult for the poor and middle class, the billionaire has urged this set of people not to rely on government fake money or fiat currency. Instead, they should invest in Gold, Silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, which he labels the real money. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Lily Mae Lazarus is a news fellow at Fortune. Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune. He was previously the editor-in-chief of Business Insider's news division and the founding editor of Business Insider UK. His investigative journalism has changed the law in two U.S. federal districts and two states. The U.S. Supreme Court cited his work on the death penalty in the concurrence to Baze v. Rees, the ruling on whether lethal injection is cruel or unusual. He also won the Neal award for an investigation of bribes and kickbacks on Madison Avenue. On Oct. 15, two Wall Street titans offered radically different visions of the private credit market. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors that recent bankruptcies in private credit could be just the beginning: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.” Hours later, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink struck a defiant tone on his firm’s earnings call: “I’ve never been more excited about the future of BlackRock,” he said. BlackRock has bet $12 billion on private credit through its acquisition of HPS Investment Partners. So who is right? Investors have been so worried about the stability of private credit recently that their frantic selling drove up the VIX “fear” index by 35% over the past month. They are spooked by the collapse in September of Tricolor Holdings, a subprime auto lender and dealer, revealing allegations of fraud in which the company allegedly pledged the same collateral to multiple banks. Private credit was dealt another blow late last month when First Brands, an auto parts supplier, collapsed into bankruptcy, owing $10 billion, triggering federal investigations into $2.3 billion in missing funds. Then on Oct. 16, regional banks Zions Bancorporation disclosed fraud-related losses and Western Alliance flagged nearly nearly $100 million in alleged fraud, catalyzing a market rout that erased $100 billion in market cap from U.S. bank stocks and pushed market volatility to four-month highs. Major institutions tallied their damage: JPMorgan took $170 million in Tricolor losses; UBS disclosed over $500 million in First Brands exposure; and Jefferies revealed $715 million in questionable receivables. The private credit market—which has grown from $200 billion to $3 trillion globally in 15 years—suddenly looked vulnerable. But credit analysts and executives who spoke to Fortune have mixed views on Wall Street’s panic. Several argue that the failures aren’t private credit problems at all. According to them, these instances are traditional bank lending blowups, and the mislabeling reveals more about competitive tensions between old-guard banks and private credit disrupters than genuine systemic risk. The question, however, is whether these analysts are right, or whether they’re dangerously downplaying cracks in a $3 trillion market that is systemically important to global finance. The definition problem “First Brands, if it was rated by us, would not have been considered in any way, shape, or form a private credit transaction,” said Bill Cox, chief rating officer at Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA), which tracks thousands of private credit loans. “Its main debt was full-on public, broadly syndicated loans.” This distinction matters. The broadly syndicated loan (BSL) market—dominated by large commercial banks—operates differently from the direct lending market that defines private credit. BSL loans are originated by banks, syndicated to multiple investors, and traded in public markets with daily pricing. Private credit loans, by contrast, are bilateral transactions between a lender and borrower, held to maturity in a “buy and hold” strategy with no secondary market trading. First Brands’ bankruptcy involved primarily BSL debt and receivables “factoring,” a form of lending where banks purchase a company’s accounts receivable at a discount in hopes of profiting later when clients pay their bills in full. Neither activity represents the core direct lending business that firms like Ares, Apollo, and Blackstone have built. “None of them do factoring,” Cox said of the dozens of private credit platforms his firm rates. “We looked at the entire universe of our CLOs, BDCs, and other facilities for exposure to First Brands. The exposure was de minimis,” he said, referring to collateralized loan obligations (bundles of loans sold to other investors) and business development companies (which are set up as investment bets on struggling or distressed companies). Brian Garfield, who heads U.S. portfolio valuation at investment banking firm Lincoln International, which performs over 6,500 quarterly valuations of private companies, echoed this view: “First Brands [largely had BSL facilities, and] that’s not the direct lending market. I think it’s important that we understand that alone in itself is really important, because there’s this whole combination of things that everyone is just putting … in one basket,” he told Fortune. The real state of private credit This isn’t to say private credit faces no challenges. Lincoln International’s proprietary data tracking the direct lending market shows covenant defaults—technical breaches of loan terms rather than payment failures—have risen from 2.2% in 2024 to 3.5% currently. Payment-in-kind (PIK) usage, where struggling borrowers defer cash interest payments, increased from 6.5% of deals in Q4 2021 to 11% today, with “bad PIKs” (repriced mid-deal) rising from 33% to over 50% of that total. “Are there cracks? Yes,” Garfield acknowledged. “But on average, are we seeing strong fundamental Ebitda growth? Yes.” His data shows last-12-months year-over-year Ebitda growth of 6% to 7%—the highest level since Q1 2021. KBRA’s analysis of 2,400 middle-market companies representing roughly $1 trillion in debt tells a similar story. Cox’s team projects defaults could peak at 5%, which he admitted is “a lot more than this industry has seen,” but he said was “relatively” low for public market comparables, the measure through which private company valuations can be derived by comparing the businesses to other similar companies that are already publicly traded on the stock market. Why the panic? Given the fundamentals aren’t catastrophic, analysts point to several factors beyond credit quality to explain investor anxiety, namely less stringent guardrails and documentation processes. “If something grows like a weed, maybe it is one,” Timur Braziler, who covers regional banks at Wells Fargo, told Fortune. “The availability of credit over the last five years, when you have more than one source competing for that same loan, maybe the underwriting isn’t as stringent.” Andrew Milgram, managing partner and chief investment officer of Marblegate Asset Management, an alternative investment firm focused on middle-market distressed and special situation investments, offered a more pointed critique: The competitive dynamics of unregulated lending inevitably lead to deteriorating standards. “When loans were done by banks, they were subject to oversight,” he explained. “As those loans moved out of the banking system into an unregulated environment, they began competing for business by loosening documentation, loosening underwriting standards.” Private credit loans are typically given out by nonbank lenders such as alternative asset managers, private equity firms, and pension funds. Without the guardrails and protections provided by traditional banks, who are beholden to regulators and the federal government, disaster can ensue, according to Milgram, who has long been skeptical of the private credit market. “Lending has been regulated in societies for all time. In fact, the Code of Hammurabi contemplated regulating lenders because every society, everywhere for all time has recognized that durable, responsible lending is central to the proper functioning of the economy,” he added. Cox sees a different dynamic at work: Competitive tensions between traditional banks and private credit upstarts have led to, in his opinion, a rise in misconstruing the overall risk of private credit and direct lending. “If your neighbor is saying it’s your dog that’s relieving itself on the lawn, and you know it’s not your dog, it’s pretty frustrating,” he says, noting that both Tricolor and First Brands were primarily bank lending failures, not private credit issues. He admits, however, that there are corners of the private credit market that are more exposed and involved in “riskier parts of credit,” where lenders provide loans at high risk in hopes of high returns. Private credit has a reputation for being directed at smaller, middle-market companies that are highly leveraged and potentially unable to secure traditional bank financing. While these firms may offer higher yields to offset the risk, they are more vulnerable to financial shocks. What comes next The debate over private credit’s risks won’t end with these bankruptcies. Braziler expects more fraud cases to emerge: “Just the abundance of credit, it makes sense that you’re going to have more of these bad characters.” However, he doesn’t see systemic risk to the banking sector. Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire, expects continued stress but not catastrophe: “The weakest companies are starting to get hit as a result of the tariffs and economic slowdown. You’re going to see an increase in bankruptcies, but there isn’t systemic risk.” The real test may be transparency. Unlike BSL loans with daily market pricing, private credit valuations are less transparent, being updated quarterly using subjective methodologies. “It is really opaque,” Braziler notes. “It’s really hard to get a good understanding of who the end borrower is.” As BlackRock doubles down with its $12 billion HPS acquisition and Dimon warns of “cockroaches,” the private credit industry faces a credibility test. The question isn’t whether some loans will default—they will. It’s whether the industry’s risk management, documentation standards, and valuation practices can pass a financial stress test. “Anyone who has any amount of meaningful exposure to corporate credit markets, and in particular the leverage loan corporate credit markets, should be reexamining their portfolio in excruciating detail at this moment and really thinking hard about the quality of the underwriting that has gone into making those loans and the veracity of the reporting that supports their understanding of the performance of the business,” Milgram said. For now, the analysts who track private credit most closely see warning signs, not apocalypse. But in a market where definitional confusion obscures risk and competitive tensions drive narratives, distinguishing signal from noise is increasingly critical and difficult. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: BlackRock brings Bitcoin ETP to UK as regulator opens door for crypto products
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/blackrock-brings-bitcoin-etp-to-uk-as-regulator-opens-door-for-crypto-products/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T13:52:32Z
Full Content:
The investment giant BlackRock has launched its first bitcoin-linked exchange-traded product (ETP) in the United Kingdom, signalling a major step in bridging traditional finance with the crypto sector. The move follows the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) decision to ease restrictions on crypto investment vehicles, allowing investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without directly holding it. The launch not only widens access to digital assets for UK investors but also highlights a growing convergence between global asset managers and regulators in adapting to the evolution of financial markets. The iShares Bitcoin ETP, now listed on the London Stock Exchange, is designed to mirror the price of bitcoin and offer exposure within a regulated structure. The product allows investors to buy fractions of bitcoin through units starting at about $11, making participation in the asset class more accessible. Unlike holding bitcoin directly, investors can trade the ETP through standard brokerage accounts, bypassing the complexities of digital wallets or private key management. The product’s underlying assets are securely held by regulated custodians, ensuring compliance and oversight under the UK’s financial rules. BlackRock’s UK-listed ETP builds on the firm’s earlier success with its bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, which has accumulated over $85 billion in net assets. It also adds to its European range, complementing listings in Switzerland, Paris, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt. The launch comes shortly after the FCA lifted its four-year ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) on 9 October 2025. The regulator stated that UK investors could now access such products through approved exchanges, reflecting a broader acceptance of crypto-linked investment options. The decision marks a turning point for crypto regulation in the UK. It suggests a shift from outright restrictions to a more measured approach that balances investor protection with innovation. The FCA’s announcement followed months of consultation with industry players and international regulators. BlackRock’s move is expected to encourage other global asset managers to follow suit, as the UK repositions itself as a hub for financial innovation post-Brexit. The FCA’s approval has opened the door for firms such as VanEck, DWS, and WisdomTree to explore similar launches. For retail investors, the product offers exposure to bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional investment wrapper. It eliminates the need for managing crypto wallets and navigating unregulated exchanges, while allowing investment through familiar platforms. The regulator’s decision also aligns with the UK Treasury’s ambition to make the country a global centre for digital assets. It supports ongoing efforts to integrate blockchain into traditional finance, paving the way for tokenised funds and blockchain-based asset management in the future. Despite the easing of rules, the FCA maintained that its ban on crypto derivatives for retail investors will remain. While the ETP operates under a regulated structure, exposure to Bitcoin still carries the same volatility and market risks associated with the underlying asset. In parallel, the UK is exploring broader blockchain adoption across financial services. On 14 October 2025, the FCA announced new provisions allowing asset managers to use distributed ledger technology for fund tokenisation. The move is intended to foster innovation and efficiency, signalling that the regulator sees long-term potential in blockchain applications beyond cryptocurrencies. By facilitating regulated access to bitcoin and promoting tokenisation, the UK is gradually laying the groundwork for a digital financial ecosystem where traditional and decentralised finance coexist. BlackRock’s ETP marks a key milestone in this transition, setting the stage for more institutional crypto products in one of the world’s leading financial markets.

Title: Hedge-Fund Favorites Rose 23% In The Past Year
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndorfman/2025/10/20/hedge-fund-favorites-rose-23-in-the-past-year/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T13:30:00Z

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. A bright young intern just left my firm to work for a New York hedge fund. That was bad news for me, but not unusual in the financial world. Hedge funds are magnets for talent, partly because in good years they can pay handsome bonus checks. Gurufocus.com maintains a screen of stocks popular with hedge funds. A year ago, I selected five of these stocks to recommend. They have risen 23.6%, leaving the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index in the dust at 15.3%. Frankly 15.3% is a fine year. But 23.6% is better, so let’s play this game again. Here are five hedge fund favorites that appeal to me now. Every major semiconductor company that I know of, with the exception of Intel Corp. (INTC), uses Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) to make its chips. TSM has expertise, precision and economies of scale. It also has a net profit margin of 42%, astoundingly high. Yet because Taiwan lives under a sword of Damocles – the threat of Chinese invasion – the stock is not horribly expensive. It sells for 30 times recent earnings, and 26 times the earnings analysts expect in 2026. Al Gore, U.S. vice president under President Clinton, is one of many investment managers who own it. He is the co-founder of Generation Investment Management, based in London. Warren Buffett, the legendary CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), one described hedge funds as a compensation scheme disguised as an asset class. That hasn’t stopped hedge funds from investing in Berkshire. Buffett will step down as chief executive at the end of this year. But I think highly of the team that will succeed him, beginning with Greg Abel as the next CEO. Berkshire’s debt-to-equity ratio is a nice low 19%. If the U.S. economy happens to get into trouble, Berkshire could rescue other companies on favorable terms, as it did in the past with Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and General Electric. I’m on record as having predicted that the U.S. will be in recession by May 2026. Could I be wrong? Sure. But I see auto loan defaults rising, along with credit-card delinquencies. I see hiring petering out. And I think that tariffs and deportations are counterproductive for the economy. One firm that usually holds up well during economic downturns is Walmart Inc. (WMT). It is famous for its low prices. During recessions it can hold onto most of its previous customers, and get new ones who are trading down. Regrettably, at $107 a share, the stock’s valuation ratios are high. I would nibble if it falls below $100 and buy with enthusiasm at $90. JP Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) chairman Jamie Dimon remarked this month that soured bank loans are like “cockroaches.” You rarely see just one. JPMorgan Chase has been pretty successful in avoiding bad loans, although it did suffer some notoriety from its relationship with sex offender Jeffey Epstein. One thing I look for in a bank stock is a return on assets of 1.00% or more. JPMorgan Chase has done that in six of the past seven years, and seems certain to do so again this year. If the Federal Reserve cuts short-term interest rates, but rates on longer-term loans such as mortgages stay close to where they are now, it would be a Goldilocks scenario for JPMorgan. Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), which makes bulldozers and other construction equipment, is looking at good news and bad news. The good news is that the dollar is weak, which helps the company export. More than half its sales usually come from outside the U.S. The bad news is that the Trump administration is slapping a lot of tariffs on imports, inviting retaliation. My guess is that the dollar effects will outweigh the tariff effects. The good performance of the hedge-fund favorites I recommended a year ago was sparked by H&E Equipment Services Inc., which sold itself to Herc Holdings Inc. (HRI) in June at a 68% gain. Customers Bancorp. Inc. (CUBI) also did well, returning 29%. On the flip side, D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI) stumbled to a 14% loss as homebuilding languished. In between those extremes, Loews Corp. (L) achieved a 22% return, and Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) notched 13%. Figures are total returns including dividends, from October 28, 2024 through October 16, 2025. Note that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Disclosure: Personally, and for most of my clients, I own Taiwan Semiconductor, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase.

The iShares Bitcoin ETP began trading on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, with securities physically backed by Bitcoin held through Coinbase, as per the Financial Times report. "As the UK crypto investor base is projected to approach 4 million over the next year, today's listing of exchange-traded products like iShares Bitcoin ETP unlock a securer gateway to digital assets through traditional investment platforms,” the firm's EMEA head of global product Jane Sloan said, speaking to the FT. "Built on institutional-grade infrastructure, [the product] enables UK investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin with the confidence of robust custody and regulatory oversight," Sloan added. The product features institutional-grade security protocols, with Coinbase transferring Bitcoin from trading wallets into segregated, offline cold storage by day's end. The UK launch follows the runaway success of BlackRock's U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF, which became the firm's most profitable fund just 21 months after launch, now managing over $87.5 billion in assets. The fund was on track to hit $100 billion in assets under management and become the youngest ETF to cross that milestone, but last week's market crash derailed the timeline. “The launch signals the advancing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as an investable asset class by both major regulators and global asset managers,” Fabian Dori, Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum, told Decrypt. Dori expects the UK launch to pave the way for broader crypto product offerings, noting that "in the U.S., additional ETPs beyond BTC/ETH and the first diversified crypto baskets are progressing through preparatory stages.” “At the same time, various traditional managers are expanding their digital-asset footprint, including tokenized securities in BlackRock’s case,” he added. He said it's reasonable to expect the Financial Conduct Authority to "proceed deliberately" by monitoring market conduct and retail outcomes before "broadening issuer participation" and considering additional crypto assets "in close alignment with other major financial centres." The launch also follows CEO Larry Fink's pivot on crypto, from describing Bitcoin as an "index of money laundering” in 2017 to placing crypto alongside gold in investors’ portfolios. “The markets teach you, you always have to relook at your assumptions,” Fink told CBS last week. “There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it's an alternative." However, market conditions remain choppy with digital asset investment products seeing $513 million in outflows last week following a Binance liquidity cascade on October 10 that triggered nearly $20 billion in liquidations, including roughly $16.7 billion in long positions, according to a CoinShares report. BlackRock's UK expansion comes amid broader concerns about regulatory fragmentation in the crypto sector. Last week, the Financial Stability Board warned that crypto firms are exploiting loopholes in fragmented global regulations, threatening financial stability as countries adopt wildly different approaches to policing the digital asset market.

Title: How a Cyber Charter Struck Back When It Was Fired by a School District in New Mexico

Peter Greene, the best education blogger ever, writes regularly for Forbes magazine. Hopefully, some of the nation’s business executives are learning about the for-profit entrepreneurs who have entered into the education “industry,”where they are profiting without doing much for students. Greene recently wrote about the latest setback for the giant of the cybercharter industry. It’s now called Stride, but for many years it was K12 Inc. Top executives are paid millions of dollars. Profit, not learning, is its highest priority. Despite terrible academic results, low graduation rates, complaints about inflated enrollments, there are always school districts happy to host the cybercharter industry because the district gets a cut of the profits. Greene writes: Stride, a giant in the cyber charter school industry, was accused by a New Mexico school district of violating rules and regulations. Now a lawsuit alleges that Stride responded by mounting a coordinated attack on the district and its superintendent. In 2020, Gallup-McKinley County Schools contracted with Stride (formerly known as K12 Inc) to operate its New Mexico Destinations Career Academy. But the district alleges that the for-profit organization repeatedly cut corners, violated staffing rules, and inflated enrollment numbers. In May 2025, the school board voted to end the contract. “Our students deserve better,” said School Board President Christopher Mortensen in a press release.“This action is not sudden; it is the result of months of effort to address persistent issues with the contractor. We are taking this step to protect our students, uphold academic standards, and meet our obligations under state and federal law.” Within months, the district had filed a complaint against Stride, charging them with fraud, unfair trade practices, civil conspiracy, and seven other counts. That lawsuit outlines the issues between Stride and the district. According to the complaint, Stride had continuing issues with meeting requirements for student-teacher ratios, having been notified as early as September 2023 that it was out of compliance. Special education teachers were over their permitted caseloads, and IEP students were not receiving their due process. Further, Stride failed to employ certified teachers, complete background checks, or provide state-mandated occupational and professional trainings to their staff. The district also alleges that Stride “retained nonexistent students on its rolls” and took school district funds for educating these ghost students. Stride failed to provide timely required communication with the district. Stride’s graduation rate, says the district, was “horrific,” with a graduation rate of 27.67% in 2024. The district also claims that through it all, Stride has “ignored compliance requirements” and failed to produce a remediation plan. According to the suit filed by the district, a management representative of Stride came forward in May as a whistleblower, declaring that the increases in student-teacher ratios was “intentional… in order to increase profit margins.” The whistleblower reported that he made multiple attempts to inform upper management that Stride was out of compliance with state law, and asked for authority to hire the roughly 80 teachers needed. The Vice President of Finance, says the whistleblower, refused to authorize those hires. Instead, in a later meeting, the whistleblower was allegedly told that his “projected profit margin was too low.” He was directed to cut staff for the next year to meet projected profit margin.” According to the whistleblower, Stride’s plans to deal with their troubles were not focused on meeting their obligations to the district. Instead, the whistleblower says, at an April meeting Stride’s Senior Vice President of School Development “Peter Stewart said the company should attack first publicly and Stride Inc. should develop a strategy for that” and that Stride CEO “James Rhyu said [to the group] that the Superintendent [for the School District] was in over his skis on this issue.” Alleges the district’s suit, ”Stride’s management, including the individual Defendants, engaged in and agreed to a civil conspiracy to cover up its misconduct and illegal activities acting, by and through its employees, agents and attorneys, in planning and engaging in a systemic public attack on the School District and its Superintendent of Schools to distract from its illegal activities and its breach of the contract with the Board of Education.” And counter-attack they did. On April 22, the district sent Stride a letter charging it had “materially breached” its contract. On April 28, the company filed an ethics complaint against GMCS Superintendent Michael Hyatt, alleging that he had tried to leverage Stride’s contract with the district in order to secure a “lucrative position” with Stride. Hyatt had applied for a management position with Stride in 2024; the company declined to hire him. The list of complaints by the district against Stride is long, but the theme is simple enough. Defendant Stride purposely and willfully disregarded the contractual requirements and the statutory and regulatory requirements in order to defraud the School District to increase its profits… Defendant Stride, while obligated to provide a certain quality of education to students, disregarded its legal obligations with the sole intent to profit on the education of students that it was supposed to educate, and that profit was obtained illegally through the intentional 27 violations of State law, incomplete and false reporting of student data, withholding technical support and operating and manipulating student counts to include students who had been dropped, withdrawn or were excessively absent. Asked for comment on the suit, a Stride representative directed me to the company’s suit-related web site which argues that the company has been working on an improvement plan, that their student-to-staff ratios are better than those reported by the district, and that “explosive growth” of NMDCA makes it hard to stay caught up with staffing. A reply to the district’s Aprill 22 letter contests virtually every point that the district has made about Stride’s performance. Since being cut loose from GMCS, Stride has re-opened NMDCA as a cyber charter school partnered with Charna Valley Independent Schools and Santa Rosa Consolidated Schools; a fact sheet from Stride says 3,000 students are enrolled, including 2,300 returning families. Those families, they say, are largely satisfied with the school. They also point out that many students enter the school short of credits, and that the majority of students are closing that gap. The Stride representative also sent a fact sheet alleging that GMCS is facing other legal problems. But Stride is no stranger to legal issues. It was founded in 2000 as K12 Inc by Ron Packard, former banker and Mckinsey consultant, and quickly became the leading national company for cyber schooling. One of its first big investors was Michal Milken. That investment came a decade after he pled guilty to six felonies in the “biggest fraud case in the securities industry” ending his reign as the “junk bond king.” Besides Milliken, Stride investors have included brothers Lowell and Larry Ellison, and BlackRock, founded by Larry Fink, whose brother Steve sits on the Stride Board of Directors. In 2011, the New York Times detailed how K12’s schools were failing miserably, but still making investors and officers a ton of money. Former teachers wrote tell-alls about their experiences. In 2012. Florida caught K12 using fake teachers. The NCAA put K12 schools on the list of cyber schools that were disqualified from sports eligibility. In 2014, Packard turned out to be one of the highest paid public workers in the country, “despite the fact that only 28% of K12 schools met state standards in 2011-2012.” In 2013 K12 settled a class action lawsuit in Virginia for $6.75 million after stockholders accused the company of misleading them about “the company’s business practices and academic performance.” In 2014, Middlebury College faculty voted to end a partnership with K12 saying the company’s business practices “are at odds with the integrity, reputation and educational mission of the college.” In 2016 K12 got in yet another round of trouble in California for lying about student enrollment, resulting in a $165 million settlement with then Attorney General Kamala Harris. K12 was repeatedly dropped in some states and cities for poor performance. In 2020, they landed a big contract in Miami-Dade county (after a big lucrative contribution to an organization run by the superintendent); subsequently Wired magazine wrote a story about their “epic series of tech errors.” K12 successfully defended itself from a lawsuit in Virginia based on charges they had greatly overstated their technological capabilities by arguing that such claims were simply advertising “puffery.” The district is seeking compensatory and punitive damages from Stride. Four Stride executives are named in the suit in addition to Stride Inc itself. The court will decide who’s blowing smoke here. In the meantime, school districts continue to learn about the price of teaming up with aggressively for-profit partners. Wow, what a story! Looks like K12 Inc [now “Stride”] may finally be brought down [& hopefully snuffed out], after 26 yrs of ripping off the public with devious/ scurrilous practices. Kudos to New Mexico & its Gallup-McKinley County schools for persevering legally against this scam operation. LikeLike I’m going to blow up that first sentence and mount it on my wall. Thanks, Diane!

Title: Trump is attracting investment to the US – but at a huge cost to workers and the environment

University of Sussex provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AB.5shr7e5jm Share article Print article Early in his second presidency, Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs was met with widespread scepticism. Critics warned of economic decline and a global backlash. Yet the current landscape for the United States paints a more complex picture. Less than a year into his second term in office, the White House claims that Trump is bringing manufacturing back to the US. It also proclaims that Trump has secured trillions of dollars of foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2025 alone. Other voices, however, estimate that these commitments will amount to just a fraction of that. So what’s the true picture? Much of this FDI is going into the US’s burgeoning semiconductor sector. This inward investment is indeed a stark reversal from the post-1991 trend of outbound American capital, when US firms raced to set up factories in countries where it was cheaper to manufacture. And the surge is bolstered by commitments of US$300 billion (£225 billion) in capital investment commitments from tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta. These investments reflect both Trump’s aggressive diplomacy and his close relationship with Silicon Valley’s tech elite. Despite concerns about a tech bubble, these investments signal a deepening state-private partnership, and a reorientation of priorities with a view to coming out on top in the global AI race. Central to this strategy is the reshaping of global supply chains. At a conference of venture capitalists in March, US vice-president J.D. Vance criticised US firms for their reliance on cheap overseas labour. He warned of the risks of losing the US’s technological advantage, especially to China. The solution, Vance and Trump argue, is to bring investments and jobs back home. But does this logic – backed by massive domestic and foreign investment – translate into the kind of reshoring (when operations that were previously moved abroad transfer back to the country) that delivers good jobs? In our new book Capitalist Value Chains, Christin Bernhold and I argue that global supply chains have made labour exploitation and environmental degradation worse. Efforts by both former president Joe Biden and Trump to contain China’s rise reflect not a retreat from globalisation, but a strategic reconfiguration of supply chains. In the early days of globalisation, American administrations supported China’s rise as the workshop of the world and an exporter of low-cost consumer goods to the US. But over the last 15 years, the US has increased efforts to contain China’s technological rise, while continuing to rely on its cheap imports. Trump’s tariffs on China represent a step change. The US’s strategy now seems to have shifted from slowing China’s advance to attempts to inflict severe economic damage on the Chinese economy in order to reduce it to a subordinate, rather than rival, trading partner. So will these investments create quality employment? And what are the environmental consequences? The likely answers are probably not, and probably terrible. Reshoring doesn’t mean abandoning global supply chains. Recently, Trump threatened sweeping tariffs on China in response to its restrictions on rare earth exports. Western industries – especially automotive and defence – warned that this escalation could break supply chains. US chip-dependent sectors such as electronics, defence and telecoms still rely heavily on Chinese rare earths. Even if the US succeeds in reshaping supply chains, it doesn’t guarantee the creation of good jobs. Despite Trump’s pro-labour rhetoric, his administration’s actions tell a different story. In March 2025, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency laid off 216,000 federal workers. Collective bargaining rights were stripped from 400,000 employees across agencies like Veterans Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Security Administration. The White House also revoked the US$15 per hour minimum wage requirement for publicly-funded businesses. Traditional sectors are suffering. Since April, machinery giant John Deere has cut more than 2,000 jobs, citing cost increases blamed on Trump’s tariffs. The big three carmakers – Ford, GM and Stellantis – claim that tariffs will cost them US$7 billion in lost earnings in 2025, with severe consequences for pay and jobs. Will the tech sector’s massive capital spends offset these losses? Most of the US$300 billion pledged by firms like Apple and Amazon is earmarked for AI infrastructure: high-powered data centres, custom chips, graphics processing units and cloud networks. These are capital-intensive projects that generate short-term construction jobs but offer little in the way of long-term employment. Simultaneously, tech companies are downsizing as they substitute AI for human labour. Microsoft announced layoffs of 6,000 and 9,000 employees from its 228,000-strong global labour force in May and July 2025, including 800 in Washington, Microsoft’s home state. And what about the quality of the remaining jobs? At Amazon, for example, the company’s software engineers have described how it is using AI to cut jobs and speed up work. According to reports, tasks that previously took weeks are now expected to be completed in days. One engineer told journalists that his team was halved in size, but is expected to produce the same amount of code, using AI tools. The environmental costs of AI are mounting. Researchers have found that data centres already consume 4.4% of the US’s electricity. By 2028, AI could require as much power as 22% of American households use annually. This surge in demand, combined with federal budget cuts to green energy initiatives, is diverting renewable energy away from broader decarbonisation efforts such as hydrogen tech projects, battery plants and upgrades to the electric grid. These figures are only set to rise if the surge continues. According to the International Energy Agency, fossil fuels – particularly coal and natural gas – are expected to supply more than 40% of the additional electricity needed by data centres until 2030. Trump’s push towards AI, coupled with his tariff regime and alliance with Silicon Valley’s elite, may reshape the economy and global supply chains – but not in favour of workers or the planet. The promise of revitalised manufacturing and job creation masks deeper risks: automation, weakened labour protections and escalating environmental harm.

Title: Stocks Poised For More Gains As Shutdown Continues

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stocks rose Friday and notched gains last week as the government shutdown continues. The shutdown is now the third-longest in U.S. history. The record is 35 days from Donald Trump’s first presidential term. There was also a 21-day shutdown under President Bill Clinton. Last week, the large-cap S&P 500 index rose 1.7%, the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite gained 3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the blue-chip index, was up 1.6%. Health care subsidies are central to the standoff between Republicans and Democrats. Democrats want Affordable Care Act subsidies to continue, and Republicans have refused to negotiate. Meanwhile, federal workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week, which was originally scheduled for electronic deposit on Oct. 24. Key government data releases, including the monthly jobs report, are also delayed due to the shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish the September 2025 Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Oct. 24, but no other reports will be produced until the government reopens. The inflation report will be instrumental to the Federal Reserve’s next meeting on Oct. 28 and 29. The Fed last met on Sept. 16 and 17, when the committee reduced the federal funds rate by a quarter-point and acknowledged the dual risks of inflation and unemployment. If the September CPI shows higher-than-expected prices, the Fed’s job of stimulating jobs gets more complicated. Lower interest rates can support higher employment but can also fuel price increases. CME FedWatch currently shows a 96.7% probability that rates will decline again in October, down from 98.7% on Friday. Stock futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones are up ahead of the market open on Monday. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 are up 0.3%, Nasdaq 100 futures are up 0.4%, and Dow Jones futures have gained 0.2%. Netflix (NFLX), Coca-Cola (KO) and General Motors (GM) will report third quarter earnings on Tuesday. Tesla (TSLA) and IBM (IBM) are on the calendar for Wednesday, and Intel (INTC) and Ford (F) report Thursday.

October 20, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: HUHUTECH International Group Inc. HUHUTECH International Group Inc. Wuxi, China, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HUHUTECH International Group Inc. (Nasdaq: HUHU) (the “Company” or “HUHUTECH”), a professional provider of factory facility management and monitoring systems, today announced that on August 6, 2025, it established a wholly owned subsidiary, HUHU TECHNOLOGY SINGAPORE PTE. LTD. (“HUHU Singapore”), in Singapore. The establishment of the subsidiary represents another significant move in the Company’s global expansion strategy, strengthening its presence in Asia. HUHU Singapore aims to drive market development for the Company’s system integration solutions in the Singaporean market, with a focus on delivering high-purity gas supply systems to local pan-semiconductor industry customers. It plans to provide comprehensive, localized services ranging from system design to maintenance and after-sales support, catering to the rising demand for industrial automation in Singapore’s growing semiconductor manufacturing cluster. HUHU Singapore is expected to commence operations later in 2025. Singapore plays a pivotal role in the global semiconductor supply chain, supported by strong government initiatives. According to an article by the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) in August 2024, Singapore accounts for 10% of all chips produced worldwide and approximately 20% of global semiconductor manufacturing equipment production. The country houses a diverse semiconductor ecosystem with research and development (R&D) and manufacturing activities. According to Singapore’s budget for 2025, it will spend S$1 billion to build a new national semiconductor research and development fabrication facility, which will provide cleanroom infrastructure and industry-grade tools for researchers and industry partners to test new semiconductor innovations. Serving as the Company’s strategic foothold in Singapore, HUHU Singapore is expected to enhance HUHUTECH’s ability to capture the growth opportunities emerging in the region’s semiconductor sector. Mr. Yujun Xiao, Chief Executive Officer of HUHUTECH, commented, “The establishment of HUHU Singapore marks another important milestone in our global expansion strategy. With existing subsidiaries in China and Japan, this new addition further strengthens our presence in Asia, one of the world’s most dynamic semiconductor hubs. Singapore has attracted strategic investments from industry leaders including United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), Applied Materials, Inc., Micron Technology, Inc., and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Stock futures are rising this morning as investors await a slew of earnings reports, key inflation data and updates on trade negotiations in the coming days; Amazon Web Services experienced disruptions that created service issues for several major websites; Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 17 model outsold the prior model in the U.S. and China during its first ten days on the market; proxy firm Institutional Shareholder Services advised Tesla (TSLA) shareholders to reject a proposed pay package for CEO Elon Musk; and Cooper Companies (COO) stock is rising on news activist investor Jana had built a stake in the medical device maker. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are gaining ground at the start of of a busy week for corporate earnings, after major indexes rose last week despite a volatile stretch of trading fueled by banking sector worries and trade-related tensions. Investors are awaiting further developments on the trade front and awaiting the scheduled release on Wednesday of inflation data that will factor into the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.2% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focussed Nasdaq added 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. Gold futures were up nearly 2% at $4,295 an ounce, rebounding from a downturn on Friday that followed a string of record highs. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading near $111,000, after dropping below $104,000 on Friday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on an array of consumer loans, held steady at 4.01%. Several major websites went down after cloud platform Amazon Web Services experienced major outages early Monday. The outage affected several Amazon (AMZN) services, including Alexa, while also reportedly creating disruptions for Disney+, Lyft, the New York Times, Reddit, Ring, Snapchat, Reddit, Ring, Robinhood, T-Mobile, United Airlines, Venmo, Verizon, gaming site Fortnite, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Epic Games Store, AI model Perplexity and the McDonalds app. Shares of Amazon were little-changed in premarket trading. The shares have lost 3% since the start of the year, making Amazon the only member of the Magnificent 7 group of major technology stocks to be in negative territory in 2025. Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 17 model outsold the iPhone 16 by 14% during the first ten days of sales in the U.S. and China, the two markets that make up the bulk of the company’s phone sales, according to Counterpoint Research. The report said that improvements to the iPhone 17 provided value that helped draw in more buyers. “A better chip, improved display, higher base storage, selfie camera upgrade – all for the same price as last year’s iPhone 16,” said senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang. The report found that the base model iPhone 17 performed well in China, while the premium iPhone 17 Max saw strong demand in the U.S., with discounts provided by phone carriers helping to spur sales. Apple shares were up 1.5% in recent premarket trading. Proxy voting service Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) is advising Tesla (TSLA) shareholders to vote against a proposed $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk. The proxy firm wrote that it was concerned about the magnitude and structure of the pay package, which features several lofty benchmarks that include pushing the company’s value to more than $8.5 trillion, well above its current market capitalization of roughly $1.5 trillion. ISS also advised shareholders to reject a proposal for Tesla to invest in Musk’s xAI, the AI company that merged with Musk’s X social media platform earlier this month. Tesla shares, which have gained 33% over the past three months, were up about 1% ahead of the opening bell. The company is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday. Shares of Cooper Companies (COO) surged more than 5% in premarket trading after activist investor Jana Partners reportedly built a stake in the medical device maker. The Wall Street Journal said Jana is looking for strategic alternatives for the company, including a potential deal to combine the company’s contact lens unit with rival Bausch + Lomb (BLCO). Shares of Bausch + Lomb were down nearly 2% in premarket trading.

Strategy (MSTR), the largest publicly traded corporate holder of bitcoin, purchased 168 BTC at an average price of $112,051, according to a filing on Monday. The company financed the acquisition by raising $18.8 million through the issuance of various perpetual preferred shares and common stock. This latest purchase brings MSTR’s total bitcoin holdings to 640,418 BTC ($71 billion), with an overall average acquisition price of around $74,010. BTC climbed to over $115,000 on Oct. 13 but fell as low as $103,500 on Oct. 17. Bitcoin’s has seen a recent rebound to $111,000 on Monday, helping MSTR shares to a 3% gain in pre-market trading, just below $300 per share. However, the stock remains negative on a year-to-date basis, compared to bitcoin's 19% gain. The MSTR/BlackRock iShares Trust (IBIT) ratio currently stands at 4.74, its lowest level since October 2024. This highlights how the IBIT ETF has outperformed MSTR over the past 12 months, as the ratio previously hit an all-time high of 8.0 in November 2024.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC$108,147.03 and the broader crypto market recovered over the weekend, offering a brief reprieve after sticky selling pressure kept cryptocurrency prices depressed in the aftermath of a $500 billion value-destruction event. The price of bitcoin rose 3% in the past 24 hours to $110,770. It remains down about 4% for the month. The recovery came as global risk sentiment improves, with equities rising and investors rotating back into more volatile assets. U.S. President Donald Trump’s softer stance on tariffs and signs that the Federal Reserve may ease monetary policy later this year have helped calm markets. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index rose 4.3% in the past 24 hours with all members in the green. “While bitcoin has seen a notable short-term correction, the long-term trend remains a different story, as the cryptocurrency’s trajectory is still heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors such as the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, U.S. dollar strength, spot bitcoin ETF flows, and geopolitical risks,” XS.com markets analyst Linh Tran told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. Still, short-term momentum may not signal a lasting trend. Analysts at Coinbase Institutional warned that thin liquidity, a strong U.S. dollar and uncertainty around the Federal Reserve's rate path continue to weigh on market structure. A spike in U.S. Treasury yields at the end of last week and geopolitical tensions with Israel conducting retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza after attacks on its forces while a ceasefire was in effect and as Russia advances in Ukraine, have kept many institutional investors cautious. Nevertheless corporate accumulation has kept on going, with BitcoinTreasuries data showing that in the past 30 days these entities increased their holdings by 8.4% to 4.04 million BTC. Access to crypto exposure is also growing, with BlackRock and 21Shares adding debuting their crypto ETPs on the London Stock Exchange for retail investors. “Overall, in my view, bitcoin is currently in a reaccumulation phase following its short-term correction, with market sentiment stabilizing and institutional demand remaining resilient,” Tran added.

Title: BlackRock’s Tokenized ETFs Are Only The Beginning, CEO Says

Tokenized securities are moving closer to a reality as issuers make plans to bring more assets and funds on-chain. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Tokenization was once just a whisper in the wind. Now, it’s a scream. Investment giant BlackRock, which boasts more than $13 trillion in assets under management, has made tokenized ETFs a top priority, CEO Larry Fink confirmed on an earnings call last week. Fink, who said that the crypto industry is set to grow “rapidly,” is calling for more regulatory clarity as his firm builds up the technology required to tokenize both its ETFs and traditional securities. The move is the latest by one of the industry’s largest issuers to merge the worlds of traditional and decentralized finance and bring tokenization — and with it, instantaneous transactions — to the mainstream. The hurdle for issuers remains a lack of guidance, experts said. “The challenge with all the various tokenization projects to get ETFs or stocks on the blockchain is that we don’t actually have a legal structure to allow this,” said Dave Nadig, director of research at ETF.com. “What there aren’t right now are clean legal and regulatory rails for this kind of activity … I’m not holding my breath.” While BlackRock’s move to tokenize ETFs would be a significant step toward decentralized finance, issuers are still some distance away from fully on-chain securities, said Aaron Kaplan, founder and co-CEO of Prometheum. Although having digital representations of ETFs can speed up the transaction process, it still wouldn’t allow for immediate movement of the underlying stocks, which remain off-chain. Another roadblock is the lack of infrastructure and cybersecurity safeguards, Kaplan added, particularly if on-chain assets are going to be held digitally by a custodian. “You have to have the cybersecurity, the blockchain technology, the operational security — everything else that’s required in order to protect the keys,” Kaplan said. “Because in the event that the actual custodian gets hacked, they could take those [on-chain] assets and make them disappear.” Still, Kaplan predicts tokenized on-chain assets, which now account for more than $30 billion, will soon be sold in public markets, particularly as agencies continue signaling their support. Issuers’ concerns about receiving a regulatory letter if they tried using blockchain have dissipated since the Trump administration came into office, he added. “When it comes to securities, you have to have the proper licenses and the technology to conduct such activities,” he said. “[This is] as opposed to the cryptocurrency space, which has been a little bit more Wild West-y.” Just Around the Corner. Really. As the ETF industry enters a transitional period, with markets moving from electronic to digital transactions, Kaplan anticipates that expanding on-chain trades beyond crypto products is coming — probably in the fourth quarter of 2025 or early 2026. “Initial use cases will be ETFs of bundles of underlying cryptocurrencies,” Kaplan said. “As more assets move on-chain, you’ll be able to create additional ETF products and other structured products and the like … It just makes paramount sense.” Some of the largest S&P 500-based funds lost billions this year as institutional investors sought out cheaper alternatives. The rare earths industry is booming as the materials are used less in electric vehicles and more in AI data centers. Asset managers have repurposed sustainable funds amid a pullback from them in the US. This change is more substantial than most. Even with the lights out at the SEC, it’s unlikely that ETF issuers seeking 3x and 5x funds will sail through the approval process. The new VanEck TruSector ETFs invest in stocks and other ETFs to maximize exposure to individual companies and reflect actual market caps. No one knows the future, but high inflation could make some investments virtually worthless. As regulators have warmed up to crypto and assets have poured into ETFs, advisors who ignore the trend risk losing clients, proponents said. Analysts from JPMorgan on Monday wrote that levered ETFs might worsen macro swings by increasing intraday volatility. The firm has waited until now to expand its US product line as sales trends are favoring ETFs over many mutual funds. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust nears the milestone, dozens of spot-price crypto ETFs are being prepped to come to market. Low-fee products tracking indexes have outperformed their higher-fee ETF counterparts and have raked in assets. The meme stock category isn’t about stonks and tendies anymore, and the new iteration focuses on broader retail sentiment. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Amazon Web Services (AWS) went down on October 20, 2025, hitting its US-EAST-1 region hard. Millions of users lost access to platforms like Snapchat, Robinhood, Fortnite, Roblox, and Amazon.com services. Downdetector logged over 20,000 outage reports in hours. Despite the massive disruption, Amazon stock closed at $213.04, down just 0.68%, with pre-market trading at $212.27. Analysts say the outage underscores risks in cloud dependency but doesn’t immediately threaten Amazon’s stock. Investors remain cautiously optimistic ahead of the earnings report.

Title: BlackRock UK Bitcoin ETP Starts Trading in London After FCA Eases Crypto Ban

BlackRock debuted a bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, one of a number of similar offerings that started trading after the Financial Conduct Authority ended a ban on retail investment imposed in 2021. In addition to the iShares Bitcoin ETP trading under the ticker IB1T, investors also gained access to products from companies including 21Shares, WisdomTree and Bitwise, which allow retail investors to buy exposure to bitcoin through a regulated market without needing to hold the cryptocurrency directly. BlackRock's product is already available elsewhere in Europe, having been listed on Xetra, Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Paris in late March according to the BlackRock’s page for the product. Switzerland-based 21Shares introduced four of its flagship crypto ETNs. These include its bitcoin (ABTC) and ether (AETH) staking products, as well as two lower-fee "Core” offerings, CBTC and ETHC, with management fees of 0.10%. “Today’s launch represents a landmark step for the U.K. market and for everyday investors who, for years, have been excluded from regulated crypto products,” 21Shares CEO Russel Barlow said in an emailed press release. Ending the ban “begins to level the playing field with Europe.” The WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin and WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETPs, which were previously available only to wealthy investors, are expected to be available through a range of U.K.-regulated investment platforms starting this week, the company said. Bitwise listed four ETPs on the LSE, two each tracking BTC and ETH. The firm said on Monday it was reducing the management fee of its Core Bitcoin ETP (BTC1) from 20 basis points to 5 bps for the next six months. BlackRock, which manages over $13 trillion in assets globally, has seen strong growth in its crypto-focused products. Its flagship bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has $85.5 billion in net assets according to SoSoValue data. This makes it the largest spot bitcoin ETF, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which has $21.9 billion in net assets.

Title: Ethereum Foundation Researcher’s Pivot Highlights Growing Cultural Divide in Crypto
URL: https://gizmodo.com/ethereum-researcher-pivot-crypto-cultural-divide-2000674151
Time Published: 2025-10-20T09:00:18Z
Full Content:
reading time 3 minutes On Friday, Ethereum Foundation Researcher Dankrad Feist announced he will be joining the stablecoin-focused blockchain startup Tempo, which was incubated via a partnership between fintech giant Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm. In response, some of the crypto purists on social media, most notably and understandably those who build on Ethereum, shared their disappointment, while others simply saw it as a sign of the times in terms of where the industry is headed more generally. Dankrad leaving Ethereum is a terrible look for open-source vs. corporate blockchains. Huge L for the entire community tbh — Andy (@ayyyeandy) October 17, 2025 The reaction to this recent move by Feist is an illustration of the greater cultural divide that has been growing in crypto over the past few years as more of this technology is built around increasingly centralized vectors of control. While Satoshi Nakamotoâs original Bitcoin whitepaper and other early writings discussed the need for a new system built on âcryptographic proof instead of trustâ and the problems with traditional systems being related to âall the trust thatâs required to make it work,â much of the more recent activity in crypto has involved centrally-issued stablecoins as poker chips in a meme coin casino. Much of the growth around crypto networks like Ethereum has been centered around centralized stablecoins, which operated in somewhat of a legal grey area in the U.S. prior to the passage of the GENIUS Act earlier this year. With greater regulatory clarity established around these digital dollars, there has been an increase in various developments around so-called âstablechains,â which are focused on these bank-backed dollar tokens rather than crypto-native, permissionless assets. A fundamental problem with ETH valuation is that ethereum's primary uses cases are largely external to ETH's market value. Ethereum can be very useful, its apps can garner great revenue, and ETH can still be low price — or vice versa — there is little link between them. OTOH,â¦ — Nick Szabo (@NickSzabo4) October 7, 2025 Circle and Tether are the two largest stablecoin issuers via their respective USDC and USDT tokens. Earlier this year, Circle announced the creation of their own layer-one blockchain called Arc. Additionally, Tether and its affiliates have supported the development of at least two blockchains where USDT is the native gas token, namely Stable and Plasma. More well-known players in the fintech industry are also getting involved, with Coinbase, Stripe (Tempo), PayPal, and Robinhood all either announcing or already having launched their own blockchain platforms or other expansions into the crypto market. Google Cloud and Cloudflare also have their own blockchain offerings at different stages of development that are focused on payments for artificial intelligence agents. Some of these platforms are being built as secondary layers on top of Ethereum, while others are completely separate blockchain networks. As big tech giants and other notable players get involved in building out their own blockchain networks where they can have more control and extract more value, the cypherpunk values Satoshi wanted to infuse into Bitcoin, such as privacy and censorship resistance, have struggled to gain the hearts and minds of the general public. Sure, the bitcoin price recently hit a new all-time high once again (before subsequently dropping more than 15%); however, much of the recent bull run has been built around centralized, regulated financial products such as the publicly-traded exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from the likes of BlackRock and bitcoin treasury companies such as Strategy. There are still pockets of activity in crypto that are relatively faithful to the Satoshi vision. Not all use cases reintroduce trusted third parties by building everything around centralized stablecoins or throw away privacy by putting too much financial data on public blockchains. This is becoming an increasingly smaller percentage of overall activity, however, when compared to speculation on dubious token offerings or further empowering financial institutions with new technology that allows them to avoid strict anti-money laundering regulations as long as they put their customers on a database they call a blockchain. Bitcoin itself has remained somewhat resistant to corporate influence at the protocol level, as shown by the resolution of its internal block size warÂ back in 2017. However, Ethereumâs reliance on stablecoins is becoming an increasingly hard-to-ignore issue that is worth watching, as the issuers of these tokens have an incentive to use their centralized point of control to extract as much value as possible from this technology. As seen by the recent âstablechainâ phenomenon, this may include a desire to cut the open Ethereum network out of the picture entirely. Contrastly, Bitcoinâs main problematic point of centralization in terms of third-party custodians still requires those custodians to use the Bitcoin network. While people are still able to use these technologies in the permissionless, non-custodial manner Satoshi originally intended, the crypto industry as a whole is increasingly turning into a way for centralized financial entities to empower themselves rather than individual users.

Title: $600 Billion Could Flow Into Crypto From Wall Street: Galaxy Research
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/600-billion-inflow-crypto-wall-street-galaxy/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T09:00:10Z
Full Content:
Galaxy Research’s latest brief argues that the “wealth channel” in the United States—the network of roughly 300,000 financial advisors overseeing about $30 trillion in client assets—is finally starting to open to crypto assets, with implications that are both mechanical and potentially transformative. The crux of the thesis is arithmetic but not trivial: “If even a modest 2% allocation to bitcoin ETFs emerged across this channel, that would translate to roughly $600 billion in potential inflows,” the note states, adding that such a sum “is comparable to the entire global gold ETF market (~$472 billion) and more than 3x the US spot bitcoin ETF AUM (~$146 billion).” The firm frames this as the moment crypto begins moving from retail-driven speculation toward advisor-led portfolio construction, as approvals, custody, and compliance guardrails converge inside the largest wirehouses and banks. The catalyst, in Galaxy’s telling, is a series of platform-level access changes and infrastructure buildouts that remove long-standing bottlenecks. On October 10, Morgan Stanley “removed longstanding restrictions on crypto fund access for its financial advisors,” allowing proactive recommendations “to all clients across any account type.” Galaxy highlights the bank’s newest house guidance—“up to 4%” of portfolios in digital assets—as a conservative but meaningful signal that crypto is being slotted alongside established diversifiers. The shift matters less as a branding exercise and more as a workflow change: when exposure becomes standard inside advisory toolkits, it can be modeled, rebalanced, and supervised under the same risk and suitability processes that govern equities, bonds, and alternatives. The research brief stresses how the wealth channel’s internal approval machinery has been the real gating factor. Advisors “can only allocate to products formally approved by their firms,” and those approvals depend on “custody readiness, compliance frameworks, operational integration, and client suitability standards.” Crypto has lagged not because advisors lack interest, Galaxy argues, but because “approval of crypto products has been especially cautious” amid volatility, evolving regulation, and a limited on-platform track record. That calculus is changing as banks build the “critical backbone” internally—trading, custody, and advisory systems that let them “offer secure, scalable crypto access through their wealth platforms.” In the same vein, the note flags movement among the largest brand names in US asset management and banking. Vanguard—long the archetype of crypto skepticism—“is reportedly preparing to offer select third-party crypto ETFs to its brokerage clients,” a reversal Galaxy attributes to “strong client demand and a more supportive regulatory climate,” while noting that there is “not yet [a] specific timeline or which ETFs will be made available.” Citi, for its part, “plans to launch institutional-grade crypto custody in 2026,” and JPMorgan “signaled that its clients will soon be able to trade bitcoin and other crypto assets,” albeit without in-house custody for now. Galaxy treats these moves less as isolated headlines than as evidence that banks intend to capture crypto flows “using their own integrated trading, custody, and advisory systems” to provide regulated access at scale. Policy context also features in Galaxy’s analysis. The brief points to the recent executive order allowing 401(k) plans to include crypto as an option” as a legitimizing step that helps fiduciaries and compliance teams grow comfortable with the risk profile of digital assets inside retirement plans. While implementation ultimately depends on how plan sponsors interpret fiduciary obligations, Galaxy’s point is that headline regulatory posture is no longer exclusively restrictive—reducing a key narrative and operational headwind for wealth platforms. Importantly, Galaxy situates the prospective 2% allocation within a broader spectrum of public guidance from prominent allocators over the past year. The firm notes that “BlackRock, Fidelity, Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio, and Ric Edelman have publicly suggested crypto allocations ranging from a conservative 1% to as high as 40% in aggressive scenarios.” Within this range, Morgan Stanley’s “up to 4%” ceiling is neither fringe nor maximalist; it reads as a risk-budgeted sleeve for an asset class the bank now describes as “both a hedge against inflation and a long-term growth opportunity.” Galaxy extends the math: if average allocations across advised assets land closer to 1% than 2%, bitcoin ETF assets could still reach “$500 billion within a few years.” The bottom line: If advisors can finally “integrate crypto directly into traditional balanced portfolios,” the firm concludes, the industry will likely look back on this period as the point “where crypto transitions from a niche investment to a standard portfolio component, alongside equities, bonds, and gold.” At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $3.71 trillion.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “For my many mentors, who taught me the importance of scientific integrity.”— Steven E. Koonin, dedication in Unsettled? (2021) Number of the Week: 0.45% per year, 0.82% per year, and 1.51% per year THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This TWTW begins with a discussion of an effort by the UN to establish a global carbon tax. TWTW presents some responses from GROK AI to questions like why do many physicists object to quantum mechanics? TWTW discusses some weaknesses in a new paper from members of the CERES project and it discusses a report on crossing tipping points. TWTW concludes with a discussion of a paper on the world record surface temperature and a UK master food plan. ********************* Global Carbon Tax: For years, some commentators have speculated why the UN was so emphatic in creating fear of carbon dioxide, which is essential for life on Earth. In the 1850s Earth was coming out of the Little Ice Age when famine was a widespread problem in temperate regions when crops did not ripen. A bit of warming was a blessing that permitted crops to ripen. The UN ignored this history. In their efforts to create fear, the UN relied on computer models with questionable assumptions. When tested against atmospheric temperatures the models clearly fail, significantly overestimating the warming of the atmosphere, where the greenhouse effect occurs. The UN ignored this fact and many others in making questionable claims about the warming effect of carbon dioxide in today’s atmosphere. Based on decades of laboratory experiments, carbon dioxide has a slight warming effect, which is beneficial, not harmful for life on Earth. Further, thousands of studies show that adding carbon dioxide will make most plants more robust, particularly C3 plants that include virtually all food crops except C4 grasses such as corn (maize), sugarcane, sorghum, and millets. Yet even C4 plants do better in an atmosphere richer in CO2. Greenhouses and hothouses growing plants routinely double or even triple the amount of CO2 in their atmospheres to promote growth. These yield fresh vegetables year-round, even in cold climates such as in the northern parts of Europe and North America. The UN typically dismisses or ignores such benefits. The UN’s actions in creating fear of carbon dioxide prompted some commentators to speculate that the UN hopes to obtain a source of funding independent of governments that can hold it accountable by instituting a carbon tax or a regulatory authority to collect fees for emissions of carbon dioxide. Such commentators have been dismissed as cynics. This year, the UN showed they are not. In April, the UN International Maritime Organization planned to institute a Global Carbon Tax, which was to be implemented in a meeting on October 17. On October 10, the US State Department issued a joint statement by the Secretaries of State, Energy, and Transportation titled “Taking Action to Defend America from the UN’s First Global Carbon Tax – the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) “Net-Zero Framework” (NZF).” The statement asserts: “President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people. Next week, members of the IMO will vote on the adoption of a so-called NZF aimed at reducing global carbon dioxide gas emissions from the international shipping sector. This will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world. The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists. The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more. We ask you to join us in rejecting adoption of the NZF at the October meeting and to work together on our collective economic and energy security. The NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided. The United States is considering the following actions against nations that support this global carbon tax on American consumers: The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.” On October 17, at the IMO meeting in London with over 100 countries represented, Saudi Arabia moved to table the talk of a tax until next year, the motion to table carried, and the meeting was adjourned. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Defending the Orthodoxy. ********************* GROK’s Answer: Last week’s TWTW contained a discussion by Tilak Doshi essay describing how big tech censors the news using their search engines by not including dissenting views, no matter how strongly based on physical evidence these views are. Those who desire to obtain differing views on a controversial subject cannot hope to do so using most internet search engines. TWTW asked Google AI: Why do many physicists object to quantum mechanics? It received a mushy answer about the so-called scientific consensus. The response was unhelpful in trying to understand why journal editors routinely reject papers written by Atomic, Molecular, and Optical (AMO) physicists based on evidence obtained by experiment or observation. Is the IPCC false “consensus” view that dominant? TWTW asked GROK AI the same question it asked Google AI. The response began with: “Many physicists don’t outright reject quantum mechanics—it’s the most successful theory in physics, underpinning technologies from semiconductors to lasers. However, a significant number object to its interpretations, particularly the standard Copenhagen interpretation, due to deep conceptual problems. Here’s why:” The response from GROK AI was far more satisfactory than from Google AI. So TWTW asked GROK AI to think harder. The response was: BEGIN QUOTE Many physicists don’t outright reject quantum mechanics—it’s the most successful theory in physics, underpinning technologies from semiconductors to lasers. However, a significant number object to its interpretations, particularly the standard Copenhagen interpretation, due to deep conceptual problems. Here’s why: 1. The Measurement Problem 2. Nonlocality and “Spooky Action at a Distance” 3. Lack of a Unified Interpretation 4. Incompleteness and the Classical-Quantum Divide 5. Philosophical and Aesthetic Discomfort Notable Critics and Alternatives Physicist/Thinker Main Objection Proposed Alternative Albert Einstein Nonlocality, incompleteness Hidden variables Edwin Schrödinger Measurement absurdity Unified field theory David Bohm Indeterminism Pilot-wave (deterministic) Gerard ‘t Hooft Observer-dependence Superdeterminism Roger Penrose No gravity integration Objective collapse Sabine Hossenfelder Philosophical vagueness Emergent QM from deeper laws Counterpoint: Why Most Physicists Accept It Bottom Line Objections stem from conceptual ugliness, not failed predictions. Quantum mechanics is like a black box: input experiment, output flawless result—but open it, and it’s philosophically messy. Many physicists (e.g., ~40% in surveys) favor alternatives like Many-Worlds or Bohmian mechanics. The debate rages because physics craves not just what works, but what is real. Ongoing work in quantum gravity (string theory, loop quantum gravity) may resolve this—or reveal even stranger truths. END QUOTE The response from GROK AI suggests an interesting dilemma for government policy makers. We have global climate models based on principles of classical physics that do not work. And we have calculations by noted physicists based on physical evidence but out of the context of classical physics and objected to by noted classical physicists. Which should be used? It may be disturbing, but because we do not have an intuitive understanding of “why it works” is no reason to not use it. ********************* CERES Cloudiness: According to NASA’s Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) mission website: “Climate is controlled by the amount of sunlight absorbed by Earth and the amount of infrared energy emitted to space. These quantities–together with their difference–define Earth’s radiation budget (ERB). The Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project provides satellite-based observations of ERB and clouds. It uses measurements from CERES instruments flying on several satellites along with data from many other instruments to produce a comprehensive set of ERB data products for climate, weather, and applied science research. The goals of the CERES project are to: Writing in PNAS, the CERES team reports that twenty-four years of satellite observations from CERES show that the Northern Hemisphere (NH) is becoming darker while the Southern Hemisphere (SH) is becoming brighter. The abstract states, in part: “The emerging darkening of the NH relative to the SH is associated with changes in hemispheric differences in aerosol–radiation interactions, surface albedo, and water vapor changes. Cloud changes also contribute to a greater ASR [absorbed solar radiation] hemispheric contrast, but the magnitude is small due to opposing trend differences in the tropics and extratropics. The break in hemispheric symmetry in ASR challenges the notion that clouds naturally compensate for forced hemispheric asymmetries in noncloud properties. Hemispheric (a)symmetry in radiation is linked with the atmosphere–ocean general circulation. How clouds respond to this hemispheric imbalance has important implications for future climate.” The effort to understand changing cloudiness and other properties of Earth that influence climate is notable but as John Robson points out, the reasoning becomes questionable when the authors write: “To gain some insight, we use the multimodel mean climate model simulations in ref. 25 for 2001 to 2019 to examine hemispheric trends in cloud radiative effect (CRE; defined as the difference between clear and all-sky downward TOA flux) and contributions from cloud feedback, “effective radiative forcing” ERF (sum of IRF and rapid adjustments), and the associated cloud masking terms (due to variations in noncloud properties).” [Boldface added.] Why do the authors seek an explanation using “the multimodel mean climate model simulations” for explanations of the data? The models have been shown to overestimate atmospheric temperature tends, thus falsified. The purpose of the mission is to produce a data record to improve our understanding of the Earth’s radiation budget by observations and thus hope to improve global climate models. Writing for Net Zero Watch, David Whitehouse has a more generous view of this paper. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Crossing Tipping Points: An organization called Global Tipping Points produced a slick 2025 report by 160 authors, from 23 countries and 87 institutions claiming we are crossing dangerous “tipping points.” These “are stages reached when it is generally agreed by experts that an ecosystem has reached a point of inevitable major degradation.” One such point is the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef. Jo Nova points out that Peter Ridd and the Reef Rebels use The Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) studies which show a significant improvement in the Great Barrier Reef in the 2020s with a slight decline in 2025. The amount of coral cover at the Reef is now higher than it was any time before 2023 since systematic data collection began in 1985. TWTW asks: How many tipping points were crossed by environmental degradation during the Eemian period, the last interglacial with the environment rebounding from thousands of feet of ice covering most of North America? Will tipping points be crossed when Earth cools again with the onset of a severe glaciation? All this is an effort to drum up support for the 2025, 30th Conference of Parties (COP) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which will take place in November in Belém, Brazil. For the report and Jo Nova’s pointed criticism see links under Defending the Orthodoxy, for other comments see links under Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science, for comments about COP-30 see links under After Paris!, and an article on the supposed plight of corals under Changing Seas. ********************* Will It Fall? The generally accepted world record high temperature is 134º F (57º C) recorded at Greenland Ranch, Death Valley, California on July 10, 1913. Roy W. Spencer, John R. Christy, and William T. Reid have a paper published by the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society stating that the temperature is approximately 14 º F (8 ºC) higher than it should be. They provide their justification for this assertion. We shall see if the record falls. See links under Measurement Issues – Surface. ********************* Master Food Plan: Writing in WUWT, Eric Worrall states that the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) has published its Roadmap for Resilience: A UK Food Plan for 2050, “The Agri-Food for Net Zero Network+ was established by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) in 2022 to consider the challenge of transforming the UK’s food system to meet our climate commitments. Since then, we’ve built a community of over 3,000 researchers, practitioners, and policymakers from across the UK dedicated to finding pathways to a more sustainable future.” Key points are: Will fresh vegetables from hothouses with CO2 levels two the three times that of ambient air be permitted? See links under Agriculture Issues & Fear of Famine ********************* Number of the Week: 0.45% per year, 0.82% per year, and 1.51% per year. The UK’s Climate Change Act was enacted in 2008. Germany started earlier to reduce CO2 emissions, in 1990, but it did not have a legally binding law until 2019. Elected in 2008, the Obama Administration tried to establish a net zero program in the US but failed. According to the US Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, based on data from the World Bank, in 2010 dollars, not seasonally adjusted, the per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the UK was 44,065 in 2008 and 47,265 in 2024. This is an increase of 7.26% for the entire 16 years or 0.45% per year. Correspondingly, Germany had a per capita GDP of 38,996 in 2008, 44108 in 2024 for an increase of 13.11% for the period or 0.82% per year. Correspondingly, The US had a per capita GDP of 53,703 in 2008 and 66,682 in 2024 for an increase of 24.17% over the period or 1.51% per year.

The Climate Creed: How Fear Replaced Science By Mark Keenan, American Thinker, Oct 13, 2025 As a former scientist with the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change and later a technical expert for United Nations Environment, I saw firsthand how the modern climate narrative was shaped — not by evidence, but by politics. Uncertainty wasn’t treated as a question to investigate; it was treated as a threat to suppress. Entire careers and institutions came to depend on preserving a preordained conclusion: that carbon dioxide, the same gas that feeds plant life, is destroying the planet.

Over the past two decades, we have witnessed an ideological capture of science no less insidious, though cloaked in the virtuous robes of DEI, ‘climate justice’ and public health. In the realms of climate policy and COVID-19 response, institutions that were once bastions of rigorous inquiry — the United Nations, the European Union, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and peer-reviewed journals — have been co-opted by a progressive ideology.

Oct 14, 2025 What you see is what you get… unfortunately By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Oct 15, 2025 We call it double nonsense because it starts with the common fatuity Thomas Sowell explores in A Conflict of Visions of believing the key to successful public policy initiatives is sufficiently strong, and sufficiently loudly proclaimed, good intentions. It is a strange thing for adults to believe about anything. It wouldn’t get you far in car repair, for instance. Or cooking. And after a few years living on your own you ought to know good intentions don’t get the dog fed, the sink cleaned or much of anything. [Canada’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change] Dabrusin’s remarks are rendered doubly and hopelessly inane by the fact that Canadian politicians, mostly in her own party, have had one thing and one thing only on the climate file for a third of a century now. And it is (drum roll please) ambition. They have not had understanding, of the science, the economics or the administration. They certainly have not had success. But over and over again they have brandished their vaulting ambition. What Climate Crisis? By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 17, 2025 17-minute video featuring a proponent of clean energy claiming we need to do more and Daily Sceptic’s Chris Morrison Yes Virginia, David can slay Goliath By Ronald Stein, America Out Loud News, Oct 13, 2025 The misunderstanding of “green” delusionists is treating electricity as interchangeable with materials, as it is the central flaw of the green movement. Electricity is a utility, not a substance. In fact, steel, cement, plastics, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals all require hydrocarbons—not simply as fuel but as essential feedstocks. Oil, natural gas, and coal are the molecular foundations for over 6,000 everyday products that define modern life. Without them, hospitals would lack sterile equipment, farmers would lose fertilizers, and the construction of roads, bridges, and homes would grind to a halt. Nonprofits Cruelly Normalize Poverty for Climate Virtue By Vijay Jayaraj, CO2 Coalition, Oct 16, 2025 Similarly, Africa today accounts for less than 5% of global oil product demand despite presenting 18% of the world’s population.” Government budgets in the U.S. and Europe have poured millions into climate initiatives purportedly aimed at “mitigation” and “resilience.” Disguised is the redirection of funds into programs meant to deny oil and natural gas development in regions that need it most. #HaveItBothWays: Plants going uphill By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Oct 15, 2025 The logic is impeccable. Cold temperature limits plant growth so as temperatures rise, the upper line where plants including trees can and do grow will travel uphill. It is even, awkwardly for climate alarmists, one of the ways we know it was warmer during the Medieval Warm Period: trees grew at higher altitudes (and latitudes). And so it was in 2002 that a group of scientists carefully and logically made the case that the optimal range of trees would start shifting uphill. Energy & Environmental Review: October 13, 2025 By John Droz, Jr., Master Resource, Oct 13, 2025 After Paris! Climate Cult Fantasy and Duplicity Precede COP30 By Paul Driessen, WUWT, Oct 13, 2025 Even the poorest US state (Mississippi) now boasts a higher GDP per capita than climate-obsessed Britain, where the average household price of electricity is US$0.35 per kilowatt hour (likely to rise to $0.55/kWh by 2027) – compared to a 17.5¢ US average and 13.5¢ in Mississippi. Brazil hopes COP30 in Amazon can unite world for climate action By Anna Pelegri with Nick Perry in Paris, Brasilia (AFP) Oct 13, 2025 Some 50,000 attendees are expected at the two-week COP30 conference starting November 10 in Belem, a city in one of Brazil’s poorer states best known as a gateway to the Amazon rainforest. Trees, targets and trillions: what’s on the agenda at COP30? By AFP Staff Writers, Brasilia (AFP) Oct 13, 2025 At COP30, the hosts will launch a new, innovative global fund that proposes rewarding countries with high tropical forest cover that keep trees standing instead of chopping them down. The Tropical Forests Forever Fund (TFFF) aims to raise up to $25 billion from donor countries and another $100 billion from the private sector, which is invested on financial markets. Brazil has already kicked in $1 billion. [SEPP Comment: Protect the tropical forests from heat and nasty CO2, essential for photosynthesis?] The End of Paris?

Atmospheric methane is the second-largest contributor to climate change, accounting for around 16 percent of the warming effect.

But as of the early 21st century ICAT stopped tracking the standard literature and started using the now-canceled and grossly overstated NOAA Billion Dollar Disaster data set, stitching it on to the earlier part of the series despite being constructed on a completely different basis. Putting the two different series together, a hoary statistical no-no, caused an upward trend to appear in the G18 paper where none did previously. It was that the IPCC and NCA ignored over 60 other studies reporting the absence of a disaster trend and put all their faith in one study claiming a trend exists. And then when that study was shown to be invalid, the scientific authorities refused to correct the record. We’d call that a scandal. We’d even call it a shocking scandal, except that we’ve seen it too often to be shocked anymore. And clearly many in the field who know better are not sufficiently shocked to speak up. Piling scandal on scandal. Communicating Better to the Public – Make things up.

In the US, the difference is similarly massive. Of the $892 billion total invested in R&D in 2023, “the business sector funded $673 billion and the federal government funded $164 billion,” the National Science Foundation reported in February. Trump finalizes $1.6B loan for power lines initiated by Biden By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Oct 16, 2025 Litigation Issues Climate Lawfare Circus Update By Ron Clutz, Science Matters, Oct 11, 2025 Orsted vs. Trump: An offshore battle looms By David Wojick, CFACT, Oct 14, 2025 The world’s largest offshore wind developer, backed by the government of Denmark, is on a deliberate collision course with the Trump Administration. The battleground is Sunrise Wind, a 924 megawatt (MW) offshore wind project located roughly 30 miles east of Long Island’s Montauk Point. Orsted just raised almost $10 billion, two-thirds of which is reportedly aimed at building Sunrise. Sunrise has all its federal permits, but offshore construction has yet to begin, or, as the industry puts it, there is no “steel in the water.” The Trump administration has vowed to stop all offshore wind projects that are not already under construction, so Sunrise must be in the federal crosshairs. States sue Trump administration over terminated solar funding By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Oct 17, 2025 Officials in more than 20 states and Washington, D.C., sued the federal government over a decision to axe a Biden-era program to provide solar power to disadvantaged communities. In a pair of legal filings this week, the states argued that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) move to cut the $7 billion Solar for All (SFA) program was unlawful and unconstitutional and a breach of its contract with the states.

UK Exporting Gas Power To Windless Europe By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 14, 2025 What will happen when our gas plants are shut down? German Energy Expert Warns Of Germany’s Energy Supply Madness…Energy Security On The Line By P Gosselin, No Tricks Zone, Oct 11, 2025 Even the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) under Klaus Müller warns in its security of supply report: By 2035, up to 35,500 MW of additional controllable capacity will be needed – equivalent to about 70 gas power plants. As early as 2030, a deficit of up to 21,000 MW is expected. This gap will inevitably lead to massive power supply bottlenecks during periods of Dunkelflaute (low wind and no solar radiation). To cover up the misery, the BNetzA is planning a direct attack on energy-intensive German industry. Under the AgNES project, the so-called “Bandlastrabatt“ (base-load tariff discount) for the 560 companies in the basic materials industry (chemicals, metals, glass), which operate 24/7, is to be abolished. The justification: Industry must become the scapegoat for the failed energy policy and “flexibilize“ its production according to the wind and weather. This is simply impossible for continuous processes like copper or glass production. The cancellation of the €1.42 billion discount is of existential importance for the basic materials industry. Netherlands’ renewables drive putting pressure on its power grid By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 16, 2025 Netherlands Electricity Mix By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 16, 2025 As in all northerly latitudes, solar power is virtually useless in winter, while at the same time overloading the grid in summer. Wind is its usual intermittent and variable nature. As a result, in December 2024, thermal power supplied 58% of electricity, with solar a miserable 3%.

The Slowly Mounting Mineral Shock By Portia Roberts , Peter Bryant, Real Clear Energy, Oct 13, 2025 Oil shocks cause price leaps, lines at gas stations, political fallout. Mineral shocks are slow burns, until they’re not. They might initially surface as longer delivery times, stalled grid projects, costlier products––or some with missing features. But if mineral shortages continue, if (limited) stockpiles are exhausted, markets unavoidably face price shocks. NYISO Weighs In On The New York State Draft Energy Plan By Francis Menton, Manhattan Contrarian, Cot 14, 2025 Link to: Comments of the New York Independent System Operator on the Draft State Energy Plan By Staff, NYISO, Oct 6, 2025 From Menton: I then submitted my own Comment on the Plan, and had a further post describing that on September 27. Key takeaway: “[T]he so-called ‘Energy Plan’ is not an energy plan at all. It would more accurately be described as random musings and wishful thinking by some completely incompetent people who have no idea what they are doing.” So, with that background, let’s take a look at NYISO’s newly-issued Comment. This sentence from page 1 is fairly representative of the overall tone: “The NYISO submits these comments to highlight electric system reliability concerns and to offer approaches that support ongoing electric system reliability through competitive markets for consideration as part of the final State Energy Plan. “ They are submitting comments to “highlight . . . concerns.” Yes, I guess so, but I find that a wholly inadequate statement of the problem. In fact, the energy bureaucracies are driving the State down an impossible path from which it becomes increasingly difficult to exit before disaster strikes.

The alternative to belief in the imminence of nuclear fusion is to accept they are utter hypocrites, that Big Tech’s AI push is a total betrayal of their once precious green energy ideals. New York to appeal after judge OKs radioactive Indian Point water in the Hudson By Johan Sheridan, The Hill, Oct 14, 2025 The wastewater in question is contaminated with tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen created during the nuclear fission process. Tritium—whose half-life is 12 years—bonds with oxygen, meaning the wastewater cannot be filtered. Regulations on radioactive releases from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the federal body managing decommissions, are based on the dose to the public, regardless of the volume of the discharge. NRC has an internal goal to keep the dose from liquid releases below three millirem per year at the release point, and a legal limit of 25 millirem per year. The calculated dose to the public from Indian Point in 2021 was about 0.011966 millirem—about one-thousandth of the federal cap. [SEPP Comment: Tritium or hydrogen3 (3H) is extremely rare. It is produced naturally by the interaction of atmospheric gases with cosmic rays.] Amazon Unveils ‘Cascade’—Energy Northwest’s Xe-100 SMR Project, Targeting Construction by 2030 By Sonal Patel, Power Mag, Oct 15,2025 Amazon’s Climate Pledge, which aims to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, unites more than 550 signatories across 55 industries to accelerate joint action on climate solutions. Its Climate Pledge Fund—a $2 billion venture investment program—supports technologies that advance sustainability and carbon-free energy, including investments in wind, solar, battery storage, and new SMR projects to power its operations and add clean generation to the grid. The Northwest Power and Conservation Council’s 2025 demand forecast shows steep potential growth in regional electricity use through 2046, driven primarily by data centers and semiconductor facilities, followed by electrified transportation and emerging hydrogen production. Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Solar and Wind Texans Should Stop Spending on Fake Climate Crisis By Gregory Wrightstone, CO2 Coalition, Oct 17, 2025 Boasting that Texas “has built more wind power than any state and is a top contender for the most solar power,” a Texas Tribune article bemoans a decline in federal subsidies for such energy sources and a potential loss of “billions in investments and thousands of jobs.” Avian Mortality: Industrial Wind in Ecological Trouble By Sherri Lange, Master Resource, Oct 16, 2025 The U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum, posted a memorandum back in August calling on the agency to ensure compliance with the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, “to ensure that our national bird is not sacrificed for unreliable wind facilities!” A US startup plans to deliver ‘sunlight on demand’ after dark.

By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Oct 17, 2025 Link to paper: Large CO2 removal potential of woody debris preservation in managed forests By Yiqi Luo, et al., Nature Geoscience, June 25, 2025 [SEPP Comment: Is this what they are doing in preparing for COP-30?] ARTICLES 1. Death of a ‘Clean Energy’ Debacle A new ‘endangerment’ study shows that the climate battle is over except for the lawfare. By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., WSJ, Oct. 14, 2025 The columnist begins with: “Oh, the humanity, I sarcastically thought on reading the names and affiliations of 39 scientists behind a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine finding that, as the New York Times put it, ‘greenhouse gases are, in fact, a danger.’ Read on and realize their book-length report is concocted for a bureaucratic and legalistic purpose, not a scientific one. It will disappear into the maw of a futile partisan legal squabble over the Trump administration’s effort to repeal the 2009 so-called endangerment finding by the Environmental Protection Agency. This finding, in the Obama years, would be used to justify regulatory actions that have zero impact—none—on climate change. Not only are U.S. emissions too small a share of the global total to matter; in practice, EPA actions mostly just drive U.S. emissions offshore. Whatever they think, the 39 scientists are part of a machine now defending its own activity and privilege, in one of the biggest boondoggles in the history of policy making. Remember the left-wing film director Michael Moore’s 2019 opus ‘Planet of the Humans’? Of course you don’t. It was shadow-banned by the left and film distributors not because it was short on climate apocalyptics—it was over-the-top on climate apocalyptics. It was shadow-banned for pointing out that U.S. climate policy was a fraud. It consisted of colossal pork barrel that was having no effect on the alleged problem. Richard York, of the University of Oregon, is seen marveling in the film at the self-willed blindness of the U.S. policy community to a simple question: Do clean-energy subsidies result in fossil fuels being displaced? ‘They don’t even know that that’s a question,’ he says in a voice of wonder. As often happens, truth tellers weren’t really in short supply. As often happens too, we can pinpoint the exact moment and exact dynamics when a policy boondoggle was born. President Obama was taking office amid the 2008-09 financial crisis. Money printing was popular; new energy taxes weren’t. So he abandoned his party’s long-standing advocacy of a carbon tax in favor of turning green energy into just another thing government money printing could support. Put it this way: Hot dog consumption would surely rise if hot dogs were subsidized by government. Purely a conceit, though, is any idea that cheeseburger consumption would simultaneously decline. It doesn’t follow. And so it has proved: Energy consumption has simply grown overall. It’s almost too big a question. Why, under the First Amendment and the special protections it enjoys, does our press still fail us? If the press has any job, it’s policy analysis—to tell us whether government actions are producing their stated aims or devolving into pocket lining by special interests, in this case amounting to trillions of dollars in the U.S. and around the world. Last year a study put paid to magical thinking. Of 1,500 climate policies adopted in 41 countries over two decades, less than 5% have resulted in any reduction of emissions. Donald Trump has been good for one thing, showing millions of Americans why they should feel contempt for their media and leadership elites. But he has mostly succeeded at beating these elites at their own game of electoral politics, not changing the game. This week’s partial Hamas defeat may prove a game changer. His productive disabling of the green energy elite may be a longer-lasting game changer.” The columnist compares some politicians, then concludes with: “This doesn’t mean we should welcome growing CO2. But if you’re not trying to get at the truth, you’re doing something else. ‘Negative impacts might be more severe in the absence of efforts to adapt,’ the report is reduced to nonsensically arguing, as if adaptation is not the definition of being alive for humans and other creatures. Two lessons are worth drawing from this whole sorry episode: Beings who think themselves independent and science-minded are not immune to the reward system in which they operate. The bigger lesson concerns how democracy’s error-correction function can be impeded when an unnatural uniformity prevails among elites. This has clearly been the case during the 16 years and approximately 350 days of the green energy fraud.” ***************** Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

Sadly, mate, too many members of the public can’t think for themselves. Climate is controlled﻿ by the amount of sunlight absorbed by Earth and the amount of infrared energy emitted to space. No, climate is the statistics of weather observations. All sunlight “absorbed” by the Earth is subsequently lost to space.

Title: One in Four charity sees more men than women come forward for first time

The One in Four charity, which supports survivors of child sex abuse, saw more men than women come forward last year, for the first time in its more than 20-year history. In what was also its busiest year, the proportion of male survivors reached a “historic high” – a development the charity puts down to the aftermath of the Blackrock Boys radio documentary, which detailed historic sexual abuse of two brothers, Mark and David Ryan, at Blackrock College in south Co Dublin. It led to the establishment of a scoping inquiry into abuse in religious-run schools and, this year, a commission of investigation. Its work is ongoing. The charity’s 2024 annual report, published on Monday, notes the 14 per cent increase in the proportion of male survivors – from 48 per cent of all contacts in 2023 to 62 per cent – and that this increase coincided with the Government’s publication of the Scoping Inquiry Report into Historical Sexual Abuse in Schools. “Contacts to the service increased by 17 per cent, with 7,674 support sessions delivered to 1,292 individuals. Advocacy support requests rose by 21 per cent,” says the report. “The percentage of male survivors coming forward reached a historic high, climbing to 62 per cent from 48 per cent [in 2023].” One in Four chief executive Deirdre Kenny said the trend indicated that when the State “talks honestly about child sexual abuse and demonstrates that survivors will be heard, people respond. “The public conversation and the visibility of the scoping inquiry have helped create an environment in which survivors – especially men – felt able to come forward and seek support.” In all, the charity delivered almost 8,000 sessions of support to 1,292 people. Nearly half (44 per cent) were living in Dublin, with 45 per cent in the rest of Ireland and the remaining abroad or unknown. More than half were men (62 per cent), with 37 per cent women and 1 per cent non-binary. “These numbers represent not just statistics, but real people breaking years, sometimes decades, of silence,” said Ms Kenny. In July last year, the Government published the report of the scoping inquiry into historical sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders. Its primary recommendation, that a commission of investigation be established, was accepted by the Government. It appointed Mr Justice Michael MacGrath to chair the commission which will examine the handling of allegations, suspicions and concerns of historical sexual abuse all primary and post-primary schools. Ms Kenny said the commission would “play a crucial role in examining decades of child sexual abuse in schools and uncovering the lessons of our past”.

Title: Will Japan’s banks soon invest in Bitcoin? FSA weighs major reform

Japan’s crypto adoption exploded 120% in 2025 amid positive policy shift. The interest in digital assets has grown, especially in Japan. Per Chainalysis, Japan topped the 2025 adoption list with a 120% crypto user growth. Japan may be gearing up for a major overhaul to drive crypto adoption. The country’s regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), is considering allowing banks to hold crypto assets like Bitcoin [BTC] as investments, according to a Livedoor report. In recent years, the cryptocurrency market has grown massively, with the U.S leading in institutional adoption via ETFs. The crypto holdings of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, recently crossed $100 billion. Other banks and investment firms like JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley allow wealthy clients to have crypto exposure in the U.S. In July, Standard Chartered also made a similar move for its U.K. customers, starting with BTC and Ethereum [ETH]. At that time, the banking giant said there was “growing interest in regulated digital asset solutions.” To achieve and catch up with its counterparts in the U.S, Japan seeks to expand its regulatory clarity to allow crypto in banking investments. Per Livedoor, a working group under the Prime Minister is set to discuss the new guidelines to allow banks to act as crypto exchanges. Given crypto’s volatility, the risk mitigation system for banks will also be explored to ensure the safety of the institutions. In June, the FSA proposed a reclassification of crypto assets into “financial products” to pave the way for crypto ETFs (exchange-traded funds). It is the same framework that applies to securities and other traditional financial products in Japan. Pundits also highlighted that the move would slash crypto taxes from over 50% to 20%. Given the similar treatment as traditional stocks, the country also banned crypto insider trading with new rules. Collectively, the recent updates have been geared towards ensuring user protections and further adoption. In fact, Chainalysis’s report singled out Japan as the fastest-growing crypto market across the broader Asia-Pacific region in 2025. It saw a 120% crypto market growth thanks to regulatory shifts, with Ripple [XRP] as the dominant crypto asset. Indonesia, South Korea, and India followed closely at 103%, 100% and 99% growth rates. Source: Chainalysis As of early 2025, there were about 12 million new crypto accounts in Japan, a 3.5X surge from five years ago.

ST PHOTO: KELVIN CHNG Krist Boo Published Oct 20, 2025, 04:14 AM Updated Oct 20, 2025, 07:13 AM SINGAPORE – Software engineers in Singapore are less likely than their global peers to lose their jobs to artificial intelligence (AI), owing to strong government support and the Republic’s proximity to an array of tech firms, say talent and technology players. The rise of vibe coding – where one can build apps and websites using word commands – is especially ominous for this group of computer experts. vibe coding Mr Eugene Yang, managing director for Singapore and Hong Kong at technology consultancy Palo IT, said the signs are that companies here are already reducing demand for junior developers, traditionally hired through offshore markets such as India, Vietnam, the Philippines and China. But Singapore’s smaller, more specialised tech workforce offers an opportunity. He said: “We could emerge as the AI orchestration hub for South-east Asia, managing AI agents rather than human coders.” Managing AI agents – bots that can work and learn independently without human supervision – to collaborate to accomplish complex tasks is beginning to draw attention among enterprises. Ms Rohini Saluja, managing director at real estate services firm CBRE, said the AI orchestration layer is where human oversight, ethical design and complex system integration are needed. These areas play up Singapore’s strengths – but offshore information technology (IT) offices will not disappear, she said. She noted: “Take an example of data labelling for AI training. Despite improvements in optical character recognition technology, companies continue to value quality, accuracy and the human lens for such data. “Such roles will not be feasible in higher-cost markets.” Likewise, Mr Ravi Nippani, head of regional industries and solutions at professional services firm Mercer Asia, expects businesses here to keep using offshore teams. These remote teams offer specialised skills and scale for large IT projects, as well as personalised customer interactions. They also help businesses spread their geographical operation risks. “Companies should not rush to cut offshore IT offices but rather consider transforming their offshore teams,” Mr Nippani advised. For instance, offshore offices could be upgraded from routine coding to higher-value tasks such as AI management, complex problem-solving and system design, he said. Singapore is home to around 4,500 tech firms, including the regional operations of major global tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. Director for AI innovation at AI Singapore Laurence Liew expects firms to bring some of their overseas roles home when Singapore is able to offer enough AI workers at competitive wage levels. The Government has a goal to have 15,000 AI professionals in the workforce before 2029, and is supporting it with apprenticeships, scholarships, reskilling initiatives and public-private collaborations. a goal to have 15,000 AI professionals in the workforce before 2029 It has launched programmes such as the Skills Pathway for Cloud, offered by the Singapore Computer Society in collaboration with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and SkillsFuture Singapore; IMDA’s Tech Immersion and Placement Programme; and AI Singapore’s AI Apprenticeship Programme. Skills Pathway for Cloud, Tech Immersion and Placement Programme; AI Singapore’s AI Apprenticeship Programme Mr Liew said software engineers everywhere are using AI or agentic coding tools today. AI Singapore’s apprenticeship initiative aims to give the local workforce an edge by injecting AI workers with diverse backgrounds into the economy. He said: “Not all are software or computer science graduates, which makes the programme all the more valuable, as they bring their past domain experience to solve business problems.” Almost all its trainees, ranging from fresh graduates to mid-career job switchers, are hired within six months of graduation. About six in 10 find jobs before graduation, he added. The programme will produce more than 500 graduates over 20 cohorts by the middle of 2026. While engineers here are already expected to be more productive with the help of AI coding tools, higher salaries are not in the offing for now, said Mr Ethan Ang, chief executive of tech career platform NodeFlair. “The market remains employer-driven, especially after the wave of tech layoffs, and companies generally view AI adoption as a way to improve competitiveness and efficiency, rather than as a justification for higher salary negotiations,” he said. NodeFlair estimates that 80,000 to 100,000 of the 214,000 tech workers in Singapore are software engineers and developers making a median monthly salary of $6,750. Regional director John Borneman of recruitment firm Hays expects median salaries for this group to stay flat in the next 12 months. But he expects the ones who have upskilled to command more pay. “The rise of low-code platforms is reducing the need for teams writing boilerplate code, so the more skilled you are in architecture and modelling, the greater value you will add to an organisation, and the bigger the upside for your pay packet,” he said.

Title: BlackRock to Develop Tokenization Tech as Bitcoin ETF Passes $100 Billion in Assets

Time Published: 2025-10-19T19:58:00Z

BlackRock is developing technology to tokenize a wide range of assets and expand its digital investment offerings. BlackRock is developing its own technology to tokenize a broad range of assets, from real estate to equities and bonds. CEO Larry Fink said the global market currently holds more than $4.5 trillion in digital wallets, spanning crypto, stablecoins, and tokenized assets. “A lot of that money is outside the United States,” Fink said on CNBC earlier today, emphasizing the opportunity for the firm to reach new investors through digital channels. Fink said tokenization could allow investors who are entering markets through crypto to access more traditional long-term products, such as retirement funds. “If we could tokenize an ETF, we could get them into the more traditional long-term retirement products,” he said, pointing to BlackRock’s digital platforms, which include tokenized money market funds and Bitcoin investments that have grown to over $100 billion. Fink also said yesterday that Bitcoin and crypto “serve same purpose as gold.” BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, launched just 21 months ago, is BlackRock’s most profitable fund — outranking even products that have been in circulation for more than two decades. The firm’s growth extends beyond digital assets. Fink highlighted record inflows across ETFs, private markets, AI-driven equity strategies, and investment technology platforms. “It wasn’t just one product area. It was not just one region. It was a completeness,” he said, noting the breadth of BlackRock’s growth across business lines. Fink credited the firm’s strategy of combining active and passive management, public and private markets, and technology overlays for driving this expansion. Fink also stressed the value of long-term investing in his chat: “It’s not about if our market’s going up or down, is there a bubble in crypto or technology. It’s about being in the market throughout the cycle,” he said. He underscored the power of compounding over decades, noting that even a small additional return can significantly grow a retirement portfolio over a 30-year horizon. Looking ahead, Fink said regulatory clarity in the U.S. and further investment in digital asset innovation will be critical to supporting market growth. “We’re just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets,” he said. The firm expects that over the coming decades, tokenized financial products will allow investors to remain within a digital ecosystem while accessing the full spectrum of traditional and alternative investments.

Fast-growing tech giant AppLovin is facing fresh regulatory heat over its handling of consumer data –including potential investigations by multiple state attorneys general, The Post has learned. The Silicon Valley firm – a mobile advertising juggernaut worth more than $200 billion that made headlines this spring with an offer to buy TikTok – was rocked this month by a reported Securities and Exchange Commission probe over data privacy. The SEC is investigating whether AppLovin “misled investors about its data collection and ad-targeting methods” after short-sellers alleged it had used digital “fingerprints” to improperly track users for targeted ads, according to Bloomberg. On Wednesday, AppLovin said it shut down a product called “Array” that an ad researcher claimed downloaded apps onto user’s phones without their consent. The disclosure came days after researcher Ben Edelman, who holds a short position on AppLovin, claimed in an Oct. 13 report to have found source code that enabled forced downloads. Edelman’s allegations remain unsubstantiated. A rep for AppLovin responded that “users must explicitly consent to download an application as a result of any of our ads,” noting that “Array was a test product.” Meanwhile, state regulators, including staff from the attorneys general from Delaware, Oregon and Connecticut, have reached out to multiple short sellers, seemingly as part of a preliminary investigation into AppLovin, according to sources close to the situation and emails reviewed by The Post. The probe, which apparently began in March and continued through the summer, is focused on AppLovin’s data collection practices, according to sources familiar with the investigation. Delaware has taken the lead on the probe, which is thought to be in its early stages, sources said. Several third-party data brokers with ties to AppLovin have received subpoenas as part of the probe, the sources added. “We do not comment on, confirm, or deny investigations,” a spokesperson for the Delaware attorney general’s office said. When provided a detailed list of questions for comment, AppLovin said it is “not engaged in any investigations with any state attorneys general regarding its business; nor has the Company been contacted by any state attorneys general regarding any such alleged investigation.” “AppLovin operates an advertising platform with industry-consistent, platform policies and enforcement measures regarding, among other things, ad content,” the company added in a statement. “These platform policies and measures apply to both publishers and demand side users (i.e., advertisers), and specifically address things like explicit content and other ad content.’ In addition to any local data privacy and consumer protection laws, states have enforcement authority under the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law meant to shield online users 13 or younger. In 2023, a coalition of 33 states sued Meta alleging violations of COPPA. It couldn’t be learned if the state investigators were focused on potential violations of COPPA or any other specific law in their probe. So far, the allegations have done little to slow the meteoric rise of AppLovin, which has been fueled by interest in its AI-powered software that helps app developers find new users and sell advertising. The company, which claims to have built a better mousetrap in an ad tech sector long dominated by Meta and Google, has seen shares surge 80% this year and was recently added to the S&P 500. Founded in 2012 by CEO Adam Foroughi, John Krystynak and Andrew Karam, AppLovin was originally centered on mobile gaming, but has increasingly refocused its business on its app monetization software. AppLovin’s rapid rise was threatened in February by a slew of short seller reports published by firms including Fuzzy Panda Research, Muddy Waters and Culper Research. AppLovin has denied the claims in these reports. In its bombshell analysis, Fuzzy Panda alleged that AppLovin “appears to be illegally tracking children” in violation of federal law – in part by assigning unique digital “fingerprints” to underage accounts specifically labeled “do not track” and despite Apple and Google policies prohibiting the practice. Fuzzy Panda also published evidence that AppLovin allegedly served explicit and violent third-party animated ads despite parental controls being activated. Those included one that depicted a scantily clad woman being spanked by her boss and another showing an elderly grandmother being attacked with a cleaver. In the report that allegedly contributed to the probe, Fuzzy Panda said it set up a dummy account for a 10-year-old boy to test AppLovin’s alleged data tracking – and found that the firm assigned a unique ID tracking the account as it played games titled “Save The Girl!” and “Mr. Bullet 3D.” Fuzzy Panda accused AppLovin of combining those identifiers with data from third-party brokers to “enhance the fingerprint and effectively track children” in violation of federal law. In the report, Fuzzy Panda said its analysis of an old but still-accessible software development kit used by AppLovin revealed the firm was “collecting 50 different attributes from children’s devices including (geolocation data; unique device identification; and even the exact boot-up time to millisecond” that could be used to specify which users in a household were kids. The Post could not independently verify the analysis. Apple explicitly bars developers from “fingerprinting” users, underage or otherwise, in its terms of service, as did Google until it tweaked the policy in February. Culper Research alleged on Feb. 26 that it had uncovered evidence that AppLovin had “systematically deployed, then exploited incredibly dangerous app permissions that enable in-app ads themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations directly onto users’ phones, with just a single click.” Culper cited research by Edelman, who later released his own report this month in which he compiled more than 200 user complaints about alleged forced downloads linked to AppLovin’s Array product, including cases where users reportedly noticed apps downloading without a notification as they watched an ad on their phone. Foroughi previously denied short seller allegations of wrongdoing in a Feb 26 blog post, writing that the company does not track kids’ data and is compliant with all app store rules. “It’s disappointing that a few nefarious short-sellers are making false and misleading claims aimed at undermining our success, and driving down our stock price for their own financial gain, rather than acknowledging the sophisticated AI models our team has built to enhance advertising for our partners,” Foroughani said at the time. When reached for comment for this story, an AppLovin rep reiterated that the short seller reports are “false and misleading” made by parties with “clear financial motivations,” and contradicted by “third party sources” as well as the company’s own statements. The allegations against AppLovin emerged as Congress steps up its efforts to protect kids online in response to several major scandals in which underage users were exposed to harmful content or privacy violations. Earlier this year, Senate lawmakers reintroduced an updated version of COPPA, which would bar targeted ads for people under age 17. Other legal challenges are brewing, including a suit by a California resident who claims that AppLovin tracked her “purchasing decisions, app usage…her movements and locations” without her permission and despite her turning off location tracking software on her phone. The complaint alleges that AppLovin continued to track her using reverse IP look-up technology and “monetized” her information to “unknown third parties.” Advertisement

October 19, 2025 13:44 ET | Source: NB HASH NB HASH London, United Kingdom, Oct. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As inflation persists and global interest rates continue to fall, institutional capital is searching for a new destination that offers both stability and yield.This month, investment giant BlackRock made headlines by expanding its exposure to Real-World Assets (RWA) — a move that many analysts see as the clearest sign yet that real-asset tokenization has entered the mainstream.While large institutions are beginning to capitalize on this opportunity, NB HASH is taking it a step further — opening the door for everyday investors to participate in the same asset-backed yield strategies that Wall Street is now chasing. From Institutions to Individuals: The Rise of RWA RWA (Real-World Assets) refers to the tokenization of tangible, income-producing assets — such as energy facilities, infrastructure capacity, or data-center power — and bringing those assets onto the blockchain.Unlike traditional crypto speculation, RWA projects are tied directly to real economic output, creating stable, transparent, and verifiable income.NB HASH leverages this model by linking its investment ecosystem to audited real-world resources including: “RWA is no longer a concept reserved for institutions,” said an NB HASH spokesperson.“We make it possible for anyone with USDT to participate in assets that produce real-world cash flow — not just speculative value.” Illustrative Earning Scenarios NB HASH’s RWA products are structured around verified real-asset performance. Returns are calculated and distributed through on-chain smart contracts, ensuring transparency and traceability. Figures shown are for illustration only and do not constitute a guarantee of return. Actual performance may vary based on market and project factors. Why Now — and Why RWA Matters Analysts from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock alike point to the same macro backdrop driving this shift: As a result, RWA has emerged as the bridge between traditional finance and digital value, and NB HASH is among the first platforms to offer it to the public with full transparency and daily on-chain settlement. Transparency and Security at the Core All NB HASH RWA projects undergo independent third-party audits to verify asset ownership and revenue generation.Smart contracts automatically handle profit distribution, and users can track earnings in real time on the blockchain.The platform supports 24/7 operations and multilingual customer service, ensuring security and accessibility for a global user base.

Have an opinion about this? Email me your opinion at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com with the subject line “AV poll.” OK, back to the show. There’s another twist in the road for lidar company Luminar. And yes, it includes some inside-the-boardroom intrigue. First, let’s catch up. You might recall that Austin Russell, the billionaire founder and CEO of Luminar, was more or less pushed out of the company by its board following an ethics inquiry. But Russell didn’t go quietly into the night. He popped back up on our radar a few weeks ago with the launch of a new company called Russell AI Labs. And now (cue the deep and foreboding “dum dum duuuuummmm”): He has made a bid to acquire Luminar. Senior reporter Sean O’Kane broke the story, which you can read here. He has since learned a few more details beyond what is disclosed in the SEC filing. This may look like a possible hostile move — it was, after all, disclosed in a filing from Russell, and Luminar is not commenting on the proposal. But we’ve learned from a source that members of Luminar’s board approached the founder about the idea last month. (The word we were told was they “encouraged” it.) The implication here is that some of Luminar’s nine-member board really does want him back, despite the fact that three of those board members on the audit committee conducted an ethics inquiry into him just a few months ago, leading to his resignation. The proposed takeover as described in the filing is vague, but it could involve Russell AI Labs acquiring a different automotive tech company and merging it with Luminar. Since this morning, we’ve heard Russell is already trained on a few options as part of the diligence he’s done with Russell AI Labs, which he views as an incubator of sorts. Two notable deals this week occurred in the electric aviation sector. First up is Beta Technologies, which took advantage of eased SEC rules during the U.S. government shutdown to price shares for its initial public offering. The shares are priced between $27 and $33, in hopes of raising as much as $825 million. If the company attracts investors at the top of that range, it will debut with a valuation of about $7.2 billion. The SEC issued guidance earlier this month that lets companies in IPO limbo allow their statements on certain areas, including share price, to become automatically effective after 20 days, even without SEC staff review. Several other companies, including Navan, have pressed ahead with IPO plans under this rule. And there is Lilium, which was involved in a very different kind of deal. The electric aircraft startup may have ceased operations a year ago, but its tech is living on over at Archer Aviation. Archer won a competitive bidding process — one that Ambitious Air Mobility Group and Joby Aviation also participated in — and bought all 300 of Lilium’s patents. The price, €18 million ($21 million), is a stunning number when compared to the more than $1 billion the defunct startup raised over its lifetime. The question is what does Archer plan to do with these patents? The company isn’t explicit, but there are some hints, which you can read about in my story. Other deals that got my attention this week … Airbound, an Indian drone startup founded in 2020, raised $8.65 million in seed funding led by Physical Intelligence co-founder Lachy Groom. Humba Ventures and Airbound’s existing investor, Lightspeed Venture Partners, as well as senior leaders at Tesla, SpaceX, and Anduril, joined. Dexory, a warehouse robotics startup based in London, raised $165 million in equity and debt. The $100 million Series C round was led by Eurazeo with participation from backers LTS Growth, Endeavor Catalyst, DTCP, Atomico, Lakestar, Elaia, Latitude Ventures, and Wave-X. The company also secured $65 million in debt financing from Bootstrap Europe. FleetWorks, a logistics startup developing an “always-on” AI dispatcher, raised $17 million in equity and debt, including a $15 million Series A round led by First Round Capital’s Bill Trenchard. Y Combinator, Saga Ventures, and LFX Venture Partners also participated in the FleetWorks Series A. Pony.ai and WeRide have received a key approval from Chinese securities regulators that clears the way for the autonomous vehicle technology companies to pursue secondary listings on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The Chinese companies are already publicly traded in the U.S. on the Nasdaq Exchange. Starship Technologies, the autonomous sidewalk delivery startup, raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Plural. Karma.vc, Latitude, Coefficient Capital, SmartCap, and Skaala also joined. Upciti, a Paris-based smart city software company, raised $20 million in Series A funding led by Notion Capital. Other investors included Point Nine and Chalfen Ventures. Zepto, the Indian grocery delivery company, raised $450 million in funding ahead of a public listing set, Bloomberg reported. The National Transportation Safety Board has weighed in on OceanGate, the disaster that killed five people during a voyage to view the wreckage of the Titanic. The NTSB issued a report that found the Titan submersible did not meet manufacturing safety standards. Stellantis and Chinese autonomous vehicle company Pony.ai are working together to build robotaxis for use in Europe, albeit via a nonbinding agreement. The plan is to integrate Pony’s self-driving software into Stellantis’ electric medium-size van platform. While Stellantis delves into autonomous vehicle tech, it is pulling back on electrification. The automaker said it will invest $13 billion to beef up its U.S. manufacturing over the next four years. (This plan hasn’t been well received by labor unions in Canada, by the way.) Five new vehicles will be developed and produced through 2029 as part of the investment into factories in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. Only one of those will be electrified, a marked difference from Stellantis’ strategy a few years ago. Uber is offering a new kind of gig work: digital tasks like uploading photos to help train AI models. Waymo is expanding to London. The company said it will offer a commercial robotaxi service in London in 2026, marking the Alphabet-owned company’s second international expansion following Tokyo. As per usual, there was more than one piece of Waymo news. The company locked in a strategic multiyear agreement with DoorDash to deliver goods to customers in the Phoenix area using driverless vehicles. It’s been a while since Waymo has experimented with delivery. Is this a hint of what’s to come? I believe it is.

RTÉ Sport contributor Sarsfields 2-18 Midleton 1-14 Sarsfields lifted their second Co-op SuperStores Premier Senior Hurling Championship title in three seasons following a seven-point victory over Midleton at SuperValu Páirc Uí Chaoimh. The Riverstown-based club made light work of their divisional rivals with player of the match Jack O'Connor hitting 0-05 and James Sweeney getting two goals. The result adds another chapter into the story being written by management duo Johnny Crowley and Diarmuid O’Sullivan, and it follows success in last year’s Munster championship and three consecutive Cork league titles. It felt like business as usual for the club and their reward was a comfortable 1-09 to 1-03 advantage at the interval. Midleton were missing Conor Lehane and Eoin Moloney, two important components in the team that reached the final via victories over Glen Rovers and Blackrock. Clinical finish from James Sweeney after being set up by Cian Darcy as @SarsfieldsCork register their first green flag in the @OfficialCorkGAA final #rtegaa #sundaygame pic.twitter.com/NGuG8EC15k The Magpies only led once, through an Evan McGrath green flag at the City End in the 10th minute after a mistake by the Sars back-line presented the midfielder with an open goal. That made the scoreboard read 1-00 to 0-02 and the soon to be champions immediately went back in front through a brace of Colm McCarthy frees. O’Connor then got in on the action, just before Sweeney rifled the back of the net with a blistering strike after collecting a pass from Cian Darcy. That made it 1-05 to 1-00 and the first half finished with a burst by Midleton that wasn’t enough to dent Sars’ lead or confidence. The game restarted with O’Connor splitting the posts and McCarthy getting his seventh, as their overall lead grew to 1-11 to 1-03. Full-time: @SarsfieldsCork 2-18 @MidletonGaa 1-14 James Sweeney slips home his second goal to ensure that Sarsfields regain the @OfficialCorkGAA senior hurling title, the eighth in their history #rtegaa #sundaygame pic.twitter.com/dJC2GQm8W4 The Magpies did make of a game of it in the end, by bringing it back to four points as more and more black and white jerseys began finding space. This started with a burst that involved Mikey Finn nailing a free and a 45, in addition to Killian McDermott sneaking the sliotar over from the tightest of angles. Then came a goal chance at the near post from Alex Quirke and this was scrambled off the line by Sars. A green flag would have made it a two point game, instead it galvanised the eventual champions as they came through the next 20 minutes without a scratch from their divisional rivals. Even when Midleton got it back to four at 1-13 to 1-09, they remained in control and saw out the game with O’Connor scoring three points from play. Sweeney rounded out the win in the dying seconds with a close range goal after escaping his marker at the City End. Sarsfields: Ben Graham; Conor O’Sullivan, Cillian Roche, Donal English; Bryan Murphy, Luke Elliott, Craig Leahy; Daniel Hogan (0-1), Killian Murphy (0-1); Jack O’Connor (0-5), Colm McCarthy (0-8, 7f), Cian Darcy (0-1); Daniel Kearney, James Sweeney (2-0), Barry O’Flynn (0-1).

by Michael Levanduski TikTok, Shutterstock TikTok, Shutterstock Everyone knows about inflation, and shrinkflation, and a dozen other ways that big companies are trying to boost their profits. This TikToker is shining a light on a whole new method that has been called ‘trickflation,’ and I’m sure you’ve seen it before. He starts his video by saying, “There’s an exciting new way that you’re being ripped off at the grocery store! You’ve, of course, heard of shrinkflation, where manufacturers take an existing product and just shrink it a little bit. Without applying that same shrinkage to the price. You might have even heard of skimpflation, where companies keep the size and the price the same, but just switch out those pesky expensive ingredients for much cheaper ones.” It is a never-ending battle trying to save money. TikTok/earlypete He then introduces the next way they try to get you, “But the new way the grocery industry has tried to screw us is what one Reddit user calls trickflation. You see, they haven’t reduced the amount of soda. Both of these cans are still 12oz. But since the grocery industry thinks the average consumer has the intelligence of a six-year-old child, they’ve put that same 12oz of soda in what looks like a larger can.” Why am I not surprised? Make people think they are getting more when they actually aren’t. TikTok/earlypete He continues, “No, of course, this trickflation only works if they eliminate the previous can, and jack up the price. Which is, of course, exactly what they did.” Great, so it is basically just raising prices with extra steps. TikTok/earlypete He finishes his video by saying, “So, not only do we have to worry about our products shrinking in size, or using ingredients of much lower quality, but we now have to worry about what is almost indisputably deceptive behavior.” They will do anything to keep their profit margins up. Hopefully, people will wise up to this and start shopping with companies that don’t do this type of thing. But I doubt it. Watch the full video below to see what you think. If it didn’t make me so angry, I would honestly be impressed with the creativity the grocery industry comes up with to rip us off #foodfacts#groceryhaul#exposed ♬ In The Hall Of The Mountain King/Grieg – もつ The people in the comments totally support this video. Check them out for yourself. This commenter says those cans actually cost more, too. I mean, this person isn’t wrong. Oh yes, a classic. Just keep paying more, you’ll keep getting less.

Title: Sunday Summary: Marc Holliday Is Not Playing Around

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy SL Green Realty’s earnings call last week was pretty good. The largest office owner in New York City saw cash flow increase ($164.4 million versus $155.9 million the previous quarter). They scored profitable sales. And leasing was downright great —Teneo Holdings, the global consulting firm, took 46,551 square feet at 280 Park Avenue, and asset management firm Sagard Capital Partners added 31,580 square feet to its previous 8,936 square feet at the same address; at One Madison Avenue, SL Green leased the sixth floor (92,663 square feet) to Harvey AI Corporation; and over at the Lipstick Building (885 Third Avenue) the law firm Fox Horan & Camerini signed a 19,200-square-foot lease. All very good. But the thing that most caught our attention was the big continuation bet CEO Marc Holliday just put on Midtown the day before the call: $730 million on 65 East 55th Street (aka Park Avenue Tower), which the REIT is buying from Blackstone. A month earlier, Holliday scooped up 346 Madison Avenue — the former home of Brooks Brothers — and 11 East 44th Street from Claudio Del Vecchio for $160 million. On the call, Holliday gave a sense of what SL Green has planned. “Over the past five years, we saw the heightened demand for well-located Park Avenue and Grand Central assets long before the competition, and now it’s truly paying off,” Holliday said. “Earlier in the quarter, we delivered on our goal of identifying a major new development site, acquiring 346 Madison Avenue and 11 East 44th across the street from One Vanderbilt. This is the perfect place to build the next great building.” Hopefully this can make up for losing out on SL Green’s proposed casino in Times Square — although this might have been a blessing in disguise for the real estate giant. A firm further along in the bidding process for a downstate gaming license, MGM Empire City, looked at the numbers for a Yonkers casino and said, “Thanks, but no thanks.” And, maybe it’s just us, but we’re seeing a pattern. The major developers and tenants are betting big on the Plaza District. BXP found an anchor for its $2 billion, 930,000-square-foot 343 Madison Avenue: The insurance and investment giant C.V. Starr, which is taking about 30 percent of the unbuilt tower. And fashion deity Prada is getting pretty ambitious with its plans for 720-724 Fifth Avenue — they’re currently finishing up talks with Related Companies to build a skyscraper on the prime spot. A few other sites are wooing tenants and, given the fact that new office construction ground to a halt during the pandemic, these sites are actually poised to do extremely well. Not everyone wants to talk about office By sheer numbers, the deal of the week has to be the dizzying, $40 billion bet that is being organized by BlackRock — and includes firms NVIDIA, Microsoft and MGX — for Aligned Data Centers, which consists of about 50 data center campuses globally (with a lot more on the way) to cater to AI mania. And that’s hardly the only big asset bet last week. Whatever anyone thinks about the hospitality market, Cain is seeing the value of the the Dominick Hotel at SoHo’s 246 Spring Street, having plunked down $175 million for the 390-key lodging, which will be reopened as a Delano hotel. Speaking of Cain, they’ve also been planning a lush new park as part of the multibillion-dollar One Beverly Hills in Southern California. This is notable because parks are an increasingly rarefied amenity, with an average of 6,000 acres of open space going bye-bye throughout the country every single day. (Sheesh! When did fresh air and grass become luxuries?) “Land is a finite resource, and it’s an incredibly important one for our cities and communities, and there are a lot of pressures on how we use that land,” said Bianca Clarke of the Trust for Public Land. “The problem is, if we use land for uses other than public spaces, it’s really difficult then to create public spaces where we need them.” The building of parks has fallen increasingly on developers, with private developers accounting for 67 percent of the park and greenway space in 10 major cities in the country. Housing, housing, housing! But the asset we want to talk about most this week is not hospitality, data centers or office. It’s housing. Part of the reason is because of the activity: the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) plunked down $49.7 million for the 154-unit Emerald Apartments in Downtown L.A.; Crescent Heights nabbed a $238.4 million refinancing for Forma, its 40-story, 588-unit luxury tower in Miami’s Edgewater (which comes with a Whole Foods to boot!); and the Miami-based Resident Group secured a $113.8 million refinancing from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for a 32-story, 279-unit luxury tower, also in Edgewater (honestly, we didn’t know HUD backed luxury housing). And we would be lax if we failed to mention that Midtown Park, the $2 billion mixed-use project in Miami from Rosso Development, Midtown Development and Proper Hospitality, got approval last week from the Urban Development Review Board to begin construction. However, the reason we’re most excited about housing this week is that CO dropped its first ever Power Residential list on Tuesday. The list represents our selections for the 35 most important names in residential real estate throughout the country. Some are developers who have quietly built tens of thousands of houses and apartment buildings. Others are brokers who moved billions of dollars worth of luxury condos. There are architects, lawyers and reality TV stars among their number. Take a leisurely look through it. See you next week! Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Title: S&P 500 Earnings Surge: Magnificent 7 Lead As Recession Odds Plunge
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/10/19/sp-500-earnings-surge-magnificent-7-lead-as-recession-odds-plunge/
Time Published: 2025-10-19T11:00:00Z

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its third-busiest week, which includes an earnings report from one of the Magnificent 7. 88 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Coca-Cola (KO), 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA), Intel (INTC), and Procter & Gamble (PG). With relatively few companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 8.5% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 11.0%, and for 2026, it is 13.9%. A strong start to earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. Bank earnings were well above expectations, sending the expected year-over-year earnings growth rate for the financials sector to 18.2%. However, there was a scare after some smaller banks, Zions Bancorp (ZION) and Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), reported loan fraud. Additionally, JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, warned of “cockroaches” in the credit market on his earnings conference call. The mega-banks, JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), can offset small loan losses thanks to robust trading and investment banking revenues. Still, the smaller regional banks don’t have that luxury, causing the regional bank stock index to plunge while the large bank index is sharply higher for the year. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7 are expected to grow earnings by 14.9% year-over-year in the third quarter, while the other 493 companies in the S&P 500 should grow at 6.7%. The first of the Magnificent 7, Tesla (TSLA), is scheduled to report results this week. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises by Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Travelers Companies (TRV), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in the earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 last week. The blended earnings growth rate for the financials sector increased to 18.2% from 13.2%. The energy sector is expected to experience the most significant year-over-year earnings decline due to lower oil prices. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 6.6% is above expectations. Consistent with the earnings picture, energy-sector revenues should see the most significant year-over-year decline. The US dollar weakened relative to the same quarter last year. On the margin, this should benefit companies’ international earnings. According to FactSet, 41% of S&P 500 sales are from international sources. With almost no US economic releases on the calendar due to the government shutdown, the focus will be on earnings. In addition to being the third-busiest week of earnings reports this season, the breadth of companies reporting is expanding further beyond the banks. Despite the lack of government economic reports and the government shutdown, the economy is holding up just fine, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 5%. Economic and market sentiment was helped last week by President Trump indicating that the massive tariffs on China were unsustainable and Fed Chair Powell reinforcing the case for two more rate cuts this year. As the earnings season heats up beyond the financials, earnings will be monitored closely. Given the additional economic visibility issues due to the government shutdown, forward earnings guidance from management will be even more closely watched.

Title: The AI revolution's next casualty could be the gig economy

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. A woman who's been driving for Uber for more than a decade explains how she's looking for new work as her pay drops. Tomorrow's the big launch of First Trade, our new markets newsletter led by Joe Ciolli. Subscribe here! On the agenda today: But first: There's a new gig in town. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. The gig economy is facing a reckoning. Two stories this past week caught my eye. Uber unveiled a new way for its drivers to earn money. No, not by giving rides, but by helping train the ride-sharing company's AI models instead. On the same day, Waymo announced a partnership with DoorDash to test driverless grocery and meal deliveries. Both moves point toward the same future: one where the very workers who built the gig economy may soon find themselves training the technology that replaces them. Uber's new program allows drivers to earn cash by completing microtasks, such as taking photos and uploading audio clips, that aim to improve the company's AI systems. For drivers, it's a way to diversify income. For Uber, it's a way to accelerate its automated future. There's an irony here. By helping Uber strengthen its AI, drivers could be accelerating the very driverless world they fear. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said human drivers won't vanish overnight. Still, he has warned that the eventual decline of driving jobs poses a significant societal challenge to the gig economy. Uber already offers autonomous rides in Waymo vehicles in Atlanta and Austin, and plans to expand. Meanwhile, Waymo is rolling out its pilot partnership with DoorDash, starting in Phoenix. DashMart stores are expected to be the first retailer on the platform. BI reported that customers may be asked to pay a delivery charge — just like they would for typical DoorDash orders — but there will be no need to tip the driver because, well, there's no driver. All of this is ripe fodder for a virtual event Business Insider is hosting on Wednesday, where we'll explore how AI and automation are reshaping the self-driving revolution. I'll be speaking with automotive innovators, AI experts, and urban mobility leaders. The best part about the event — it's free! Hope to see you there. AI startup Friend offers a $129 necklace that aims to help solve the loneliness crisis by going with you everywhere. If the oft-graffitied subway ads are any indication, New Yorkers aren't buying it. BI's Amanda Hoover tested out the necklace for a week. While the bot could hold a conversation, Hoover wasn't convinced it really counted as a friend. What it got wrong about friendship. Also read: Last month, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban joined the ranks of broken-up couples where the woman outearns the man. That particular ending is more common than you may think. Divorce rates for heterosexual couples go up when a woman is more professionally successful than the man, and they go down when the opposite is true. It shows how women's economic progress is clashing with old expectations about marriage, an executive coach said. But it doesn't mean your marriage is doomed. As of this month, the Nvidia CEO has 36 direct reports, according to an internal list obtained by BI. The list offers a glimpse into the group of leaders at the top of the world's most valuable company. Last year, Huang said he had 55 direct reports. He's known for having many people report into him, and has said it helps with information flow. Here's who's reporting to Huang. Amazon Web Services is feeling a shift in one of its biggest clientele segments, according to internal documents obtained by BI. Startups, which typically allocate a significant portion of their budgets to AWS, are instead spending it on AI tools. "Founders tell us they seek to adopt AWS at a later stage," the company warned in one of the documents. The shift represents a massive threat to AWS, which holds a firm grip on the lucrative startup ecosystem. More on Cloud 2.0. This week's quote: "When a brand becomes iconic, simplicity is the ultimate flex." — Matt Sia, executive creative director at design services firm Pearlfisher, on Apple TV ditching the plus sign. How Arizona tea has kept its 99-cent price tag Iced tea cans from Arizona Beverages have had the same price point since 1992. That famous price tag was once under threat, though.

Trade is the talk of the town this week. Investors will be watching for updates on trade policy ahead of a scheduled meeting between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping, as well as a highly anticipated inflation reading, after a volatile week of trading marked by worries about bad loans at regional banks. Friday’s release of the Consumer Price Index for September, delayed by the government shutdown, is likely the last major piece of data the Federal Reserve will receive before its interest rate decision next week. Other government reports could remain delayed until there is a resolution to the budget dispute in Washington. Magnificent 7 member Tesla is set to report earnings Wednesday, when CEO Elon Musk could offer more details on the electric vehicles maker's advances in robotics and artificial intelligence, after a torrid rally in recent months. Intel’s report will be in focus after a flurry of investments in the struggling chipmaker boosted its stock. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Tesla’s scheduled earnings release Wednesday follows stronger-than-expected deliveries as buyers rushed to take advantage of expiring EV tax credits. Big Three automakers Ford and General Motors, also set to report this week, likely benefited from the same tailwinds, though both automakers have scaled back their EV ambitions. Tesla CEO Elon Musk could offer more details on developments in the company's high-tech offerings beyond EVs, including an expansion of its robotaxi services, its Optimus robots, and self-driving technology. Intel’s report, due Thursday, comes as the U.S. chipmaker’s shares have surged after a string of deals including one that saw the U.S. government take a stake and a partnership with AI leader Nvidia. Netflix’s report comes after the streamer recently raised its prices and boosted its revenue outlook. Updates from Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble could bring some insights into consumer spending, while Friday’s earnings from HCA Healthcare may offer a look into the hospital sector. Gold miner Newmont’s report on Thursday arrives as the precious metal has set a string of new all-time highs . With many economic reports in limbo due to the federal shutdown, Friday's CPI inflation report could be the last major piece of economic data the Fed gets before issuing a decision on interest rates next week. Forecasters expect the report to show prices continuing to rise, but at a slower pace than in August. The data could influence whether the Fed will continue with its plans to keep lowering interest rates. Fed officials have said their focus is turning to the weakening labor market, which would favor rate cuts. But higher-than-expected inflation could push them to reconsider. While the release of new home sales data is likely to be delayed, market watchers will still see on Thursday the National Association of Realtors’ existing home sales data for September, as economists look for signs of a resurgence in an anemic housing market. The week will also bring fresh figures on consumer sentiment and Purchasing Managers Index surveys for October. Quick Links: Recap Last Week’s Trading | Latest Markets News Monday, Oct. 20 Tuesday, Oct. 21 Wednesday, Oct. 22 Thursday, Oct. 23 Friday, Oct. 24 Banking fees are rising at one major bank, with new waiver rules for checking accounts taking effect this month.

Title: Hideo Kojima Says AI Is “A Friend,” Not a Threat to Creativity in Game Development
URL: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Hideo-Kojima-Says-AI-Is-A-Friend-Not-a-Threat-to-Creativity-in-Game-Development.1141848.0.html
Time Published: 2025-10-19T01:46:00Z

Hideo Kojima recently shared an optimistic view on artificial intelligence, framing it not as a threat to the games industry or to human creativity for that matter, but a collaborative “friend’ that can handle the more time-consuming aspects of game development. In a recent interview with Wired Japan, Kojima highlighted that while many in the industry use AI to generate ideas, he views it differently, stating: “A lot of people use AI in creative work to come up with ideas. But I think of AI as more of a friend… I would lead the creative part and use AI to boost efficiency.” Kojima’s perspective on the use of AI and its role in creative workflows comes amid a time when many companies like Activision, Level-5, and Capcom are using AI. A recent survey in June and July found that 32% of CESA member companies are using AI to develop in-house game engines, extend to visual game assets, generate text, and assist in programming. It’s pretty surprising how much of a foothold AI already has in gaming, considering some companies have been quite open about their use of AI in pretty much everything from visual upscaling to code generation, even as user and developer pushback continues on multiple mediums. Kojima's approach shows how AI can be used to streamline monotonous tasks such as animation, motion capture, and NPC behaviors without supplanting the core creative process in video game development. He further added in the Wired interview, saying, I’d like AI to handle the tedious tasks. That would lower the cost and cut down on time. It’s more like co-creating with AI instead of just using it. I see a future where I stay one step ahead, creating together with AI. Kojima’s stance on the use of AI stands in stark contrast to the push toward full automation in some sectors, maintaining AI as a tool for efficiency rather than a complete substitute. For instance, during the development of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Kojima Productions employed machine learning for scanning actors, including Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna, to create digital models. While Death Stranding 2: On the Beach has been praised for its high-fidelity visuals, realistic character models, and facial animations, Kojima himself views the result as merely “okay” and seeks even greater realism in future endeavors like OD and Physint. At the New Global Sport Conference in Riyadh in August, he discussed a few challenges during Death Stranding 2’s production, and mentioned: We scanned and we made a rig, an AI machine learning rig. We took so much time and made sure that we scanned them into digital, but made sure that they move analog in a way. And it took so much time. Looking back, I think it’s okay. But my next project, I think I want to make it more realistic. Debates over the use of AI in the game industry continue unabated, even as it remains the leading cause for layoffs in an industry struggling to find sustained profitability. While some developers are aiming for total automation, Kojima’s vision for using AI as a co-creator could help reduce game development costs, while making sure humans remain at the helm of innovation.Buy Death Stranding 2: On The Beach on Amazon Wired - Instagram

Title: Banjo-Kazooie director Gregg Mayles leaves Rare after 36 years as he announces exit on X
URL: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Banjo-Kazooie-director-Gregg-Mayles-leaves-Rare-after-36-years-as-he-announces-exit-on-X.1141847.0.html
Time Published: 2025-10-19T00:58:00Z
Full Content:
Gregg Mayles, the director behind Banjo-Kazooie, has finally bid farewell to Rare after an impressive 36 years at the British studio. Mayles, who joined Rare in 1989 straight out of high school, announced his exit on X in poetic alliteration, titled “A Rather Resplendent Rewarding Rare Ramble,” fittingly referencing the rhyming dialogue that defined Banjo-Kazooie. The poem basically recounts his journey, from his early days ignoring banking for game design to contributing to hits like Battletoads, Donkey Kong Country, Diddy Kong Racing, Grabbed by the Ghoulies, Viva Piñata, and Sea of Thieves, while expressing gratitude to fans and colleagues. He ended the post with the line “Now time to start new tales to tell, Farewell to Rare, he waves, farewell!” Over his tenure, Mayles worked on 30 games, helping shape Rare’s golden era during the Nintendo 64 heyday. He contributed to classics such as the 1998 platformer Banjo-Kazooie, which sold over 3.6 million copies worldwide and spawned sequels like Banjo-Tooie in 2000. He also contributed to many other beloved titles, including the 1994 beat ‘em up Battletoads, the Donkey Kong series starting with Donkey Kong Country in 1994, the 2003 Xbox horror-comedy Grabbed by the Ghoulies, the 2006 life sim Viva Pinata, and most recently, directed the live-service hit pirate adventure multiplayer game, Sea of Thieves, which launched in 2018 and has since amassed more than 40 million players across all platforms. This announcement comes amid a turbulent and dark period for Rare, following Microsoft’s acquisition of the studio in 2002 for $375 million, after which it shifted focus from Nintendo to Xbox. While Sea of Thieves stands as Rare’s most successful release, the studio had nonetheless faced many hiccups throughout the years, like 2013's Kinect Sports. Notable here is ambitious open-world adventure Everwild, whose development was being overseen by Gregg Mayles himself. The game was announced in 2019 and had been in development for over five years. However, Microsoft canceled Everwild in July 2025 as part of broader layoffs, affecting up to 9000 employees company-wide. This also included cuts at Rare and the scrapping of The Initiative's Perfect Dark Reboot, another project tied to Rare’s legacy. Sources report that the cancellation of Everwild, after nearly a decade of troubled development and multiple reboots, likely influenced Mayles' decision to leave Rare. However, he didn’t specify the reason in his post on X. Gregg Mayles - X

Add PCMag as a preferred source on Google. Amazon-owned home security company Ring has partnered with Flock Safety, a company whose network of AI-assisted cameras is used by thousands of law enforcement agencies across the US—just weeks after announcing a similar tie-up with security firm Axon Enterprise. The partnerships will allow police to send requests to Ring camera owners when they're trying to track down footage that could help in an ongoing investigation. The requests must include a specific location and timeframe, as well as details about what is being investigated. This Community Requests feature is optional; agencies can’t see who received a notification or who chose not to respond. You can also turn off Community Request notifications altogether. Amazon previously offered a similar program called Request for Assistance (RFA), which it phased out last year. Though 2,000 police departments across the country were thought to have used the feature, it was dogged by accusations of overreach and misuse among neighbors. Last month, Ring revived the program under the Community Requests moniker. "We believe that when neighbors have simple, secure ways to look out for each other, we all benefit," it said. However, the Flock partnership comes after 404 Media revealed that a division of ICE, the Secret Service, and the Navy’s Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) has access to Flock’s nationwide network of AI-enabled cameras. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said his office investigated reports of abuse by agencies using Flock technology, and "it is my view that Flock has built a dangerous platform in which abuse of surveillance data is almost certain," he wrote in a letter to Flock's CEO this week. "In particular, the company has adopted a see-no-evil approach of not proactively auditing the searches done by its law enforcement customers because, as the company’s Chief Communications Officer told the press, 'it is not Flock’s job to police the police.'"

Title: Ready To Retire? These 8%+ CEFs Show The Way
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/10/18/ready-to-retire-these-8-cefs-show-the-way/
Time Published: 2025-10-18T15:11:00Z

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. I’m regularly struck by something American investors always seem to take for granted: The many choices we have available to gain financial independence. And investors in closed-end funds (CEFs) make the most of these choices. These high-yielding funds kick out 8%+ dividends on average, and the portfolio of my CEF Insider service, which helps investors make the most of CEFs, pays even more, with its 18 holdings paying a rich average yield of 9.4%. Plus, these funds offer stock-like upside, which makes them pretty much tailor-made for delivering financial freedom. We’ll sketch out how two specific CEFs can help you find your way to an earlier, richer retirement in a bit. But first, back to that embarrassment of choices I mentioned a second ago. Back in my 20s, when I was studying to get my PhD in Europe, I was told I had to pay into the national pension fund, and I would get that money back when I qualified for it. At that time, I qualified at 62, which seemed absurd—nearly 40 years for me (a severely underpaid academic!) to get back money I desperately needed today. But as it turns out, I was lucky. Europe’s mandatory retirement age is rising. Denmark, which currently has the oldest retirement age in Europe at 67, is raising that to 70. Germany, where a normal retirement age is currently 66, is discussing raising that to 73. Whether you like the life of a worker or not, I’m almost certain that you like having the ability to choose that life without having to worry about governments changing the rules on you mid-game. This lack of choice pushed me away from Europe in my 20s and led me back to America. Here’s what I found when I returned. This chart shows that the average American household has gone from $200k in savings in the 1980s to $1.2 million now—and, no, that isn’t due to inflation. That $200k in savings would be $535k in 2025 dollars, so more than half of the jump to $1.2 million is due to actual value being created. Of course, that wealth isn’t going everywhere. While all households have gotten richer on average, the top 0.1% of the population is attracting a greater proportion of overall wealth in the US, now near 14%. The ethics of this aside, it’s clear that the households that have more wealth now have more choices—about when to retire, where to live, what lifestyle to adopt and so on. In a way, it seems like Europeans have too little choice and Americans have so much that retirement investing can be tough for individual investors to navigate without either taking undue risks or locking themselves into weak returns. This is where CEFs come in, with their focus on assets from well-established companies. Plus their high yields almost act like a “mini-pension,” boosting your income without leaving you at the whim of the government. This is the way I viewed CEFs in my late 20s, when I began using their high dividends to get the income I needed to make the choices I wanted. I still view them this way. And in addition to their big dividends, these funds often chalk up strong returns, too, thanks in large part to their discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios). As these discounts—which only apply to CEFs, by the way—shrink, they put upward pressure on the fund’s price. And the best part is that CEFs are easy to buy, trading on public markets just like stocks. Consider the first CEF we’re looking at today, the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX). It’s one of the oldest funds in the world, tracing its history back to the 19th century (and is a current CEF Insider holding, too). This one is about as blue chip as it gets, with stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) among its top holdings. What’s more—and this is the key part—ADX trades at an 8.3% discount to NAV as I write this, and that discount is in the sweet spot, cheaper than it was a few months ago but carrying momentum as it steams toward par. ADX has been paying dividends since before the Great Depression, and its 8.3% dividend yield is fully covered by the 13.3% total NAV return (or the return on its underlying portfolio) it’s enjoyed over the last decade. Moreover, ADX has delivered a 5,340% return to its shareholders, with dividends reinvested, since the late 1980s, when US household wealth just started to meaningfully tick higher. That kind of performance—coming our way at a discount and with an 8.3% dividend—is exactly what we want from our “mini-pension,” and ADX delivers. But, as I said, we do have choices here. And ADX isn’t the only US-stock-focused CEF that delivers a large income stream and has withstood the test of time. Another is the General American Investors Company (GAM), which was launched in 1927 and yielded an impressive 9.4% to investors in 2024. GAM also holds large caps, with Alphabet (GOOGL), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and Apple (AAPL) among its top holdings. And, like ADX, this fund’s market price–based return has been strong over the last decade—though not quite as strong as ADX—with a 14.4% annualized return. Moreover, GAM’s 9.3% discount sounds like a good deal, but that’s near its smallest-ever level, so we’re not rushing out to buy the fund today. But it is worth watching, and gets tempting when that discount drops to double digits. But the larger point remains: With high-yielding CEFs like these, we can start generating a meaningful income stream we can choose to use however we like.

Title: A $5 billion deal key to CoreWeave's AI empire just lost another investor's support

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A large shareholder in Core Scientific, a data center developer and operator, said he would reject a proposed purchase of the company by the rival data center firm CoreWeave in an upcoming shareholder vote. "Under the math of the deal today, I would have to vote no," Trip Miller, the founder of the investment firm Gullane Capital, told Business Insider on Friday afternoon. Gullane, based in Memphis, Tennessee, is the third-largest shareholder in Core Scientific, behind Vanguard and BlackRock, and owns a stake in the company worth about $200 million. Miller's opposition adds to other recent pushback against the deal, casting doubt on one of the year's largest data center mergers. CoreWeave — the AI cloud darling racing to scale its computing power — needs the roughly $5 billion takeover to help it continue to grow rapidly and also cut billions of dollars in soaring costs. But a dip in its stock price has weakened the offer's value, exacerbating investor concerns that the deal sharply undervalues Core Scientific just weeks before shareholders are set to vote on the transaction. On October 14, Two Seas Capital, another investment firm that owns about 6.3% of Core Scientific's stock, published a lengthy presentation that outlined its myriad objections to the takeover, including that it was not profitable enough for stock owners. The firm urged investors to reject it in the upcoming shareholder vote on October 30. In response, the CEO of the Livingston, New Jersey-based CoreWeave said the acquisition was "the most compelling path forward for Core Scientific stockholders" and that the present deal would be its "best and final" offer for the company. "The combination will offer Core Scientific and CoreWeave stockholders the opportunity to benefit from the tremendous upside potential and long-term value creation driven by greater verticalization," Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO, wrote in a letter published on October 16. Intrator said the complaints from Two Seas Capital were "misleading and misinformed." CoreWeave's rapid, debt-fueled growth has thrust it into the center of a growing debate over whether AI speculation has become a bubble or if early movers like it are seizing on a historic investment opportunity. In July, CoreWeave announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Core Scientific in a stock conversion deal that valued Core Scientific at roughly $9 billion at the time and $20.40 per share — a 66% per share premium over what Core Scientific stock had then been recently trading for. But in the ensuing months, the economics have shifted as CoreWeave's shares have dipped and Core Scientific's have risen. The stock conversion deal currently values Core Scientific's shares at around $17, more than 10% below its market price of about $19 on Friday.CoreWeave and Core Scientific did not respond to requests to comment. "This is not a popular deal, I think for one simple reason: it's a flawed structure," Miller said. "It would be a deal that would value my shares, actually, at a discount to what they currently trade for today." Since a shaky initial public offering in March, CoreWeave has raced to a $70 billion market capitalization — more than three times its value after the IPO — and a place at the forefront of the booming data center business. It has announced blockbuster deals with some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and the chipmaker Nvidia, and has spent billions of dollars snapping up AI developers and cloud providers to broaden its capabilities and customer offerings. In the company's second-quarter earnings call, Intrator said that its biggest customers required the development of infrastructure, including data centers, on a "planetary" scale. "We are aggressively expanding our footprint on the back of intensifying demand signals from our customers, ensuring that we maintain a durable, multi-year runway for growth," Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO and cofounder, said in the company's second quarter earnings call. CoreWeave said it is expanding its roughly 470 megawatts of operating data centers to more than 900 megawatts by the end of 2025 — enough power to light up about a fifth of New York City on an average day. The Core Scientific acquisition would more than double that by operational megawattage and expand the company's pipeline of contracted future power by 50% to more than 3 gigawatts. Revenue for CoreWeave in the second quarter was $1.2 billion, more than double the same period a year prior, the company reported, and its revenue backlog of $30.1 billion had doubled since the beginning of the year — demonstrating its tremendous business prospects. Its operating margins, however, fell from 20% to 2% year over year, a sign of how costs are increasingly eating into the company's profitability. The company reported its debt had grown to $11.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, a 40% increase from the beginning of the year, and that its borrowing costs ranged from 7% to 15% on its various loans. Gil Luria, an analyst who covers the company, has raised concerns about the high-cost borrowing compared to the company's slimmer profit margins. "They're selling $20 bills for 15 bucks," Luria said. "Sometimes we forget to ask ourselves if this business should even exist," Luria said. "I'm not sure the answer is yes." Acquiring Core Scientific would streamline some of CoreWeave's mounting overhead. CoreWeave rents roughly 270 megawatts of data center space from Core Scientific, and owning the company would allow CoreWeave to save about $10 billion in lease payments for that space over the next 12 years, it has said. "They realize how important this is to the long-term viability of their business model, owning the economics around their largest cost, which is data centers," said Raul Martynek, the CEO of the data center developer and operator DataBank, which is not involved in the deal. Martynek said that Intrator's response letter signified the CEO was making a "full-throated defense of their offer" to purchase Core Scientific. Among the concerns outlined in its presentation, Two Seas said that the deal didn't offer shareholders protection from stock fluctuations that have upended the economics of the transaction. "The initial headline deal price of $20.40 per share undervalued Core Scientific's intrinsic value and strategic value to CoreWeave," Two Seas Capital wrote. "Following one of the worst post-deal drawdowns in an acquirer's stock price since 2020; the current deal value of less than $18 per share reflects a take-under of Core Scientific." In his letter on Thursday, Intrator wrote that CoreWeave represents Core Scientific's only meaningful data center customer and that its business accounts for 76% of Core Scientific's revenue. Intrator added that Core Scientific investors should "think objectively about Core Scientific's stand-alone prospects and the significant risks involved" in rejecting the deal and remaining an independent company." Miller disagreed, stating that in a hot data center market, "the belief is, if you leave this company alone for 18 months, it's a $30 to $40 company" per share, and that he felt it could be a more lucrative acquisition target.

Shares of a major credit card issuer moved higher as a refresh of high-end cards and strong spending among affluent customers helped drive a quarterly earnings beat. Meanwhile, gold prices retreated from their recent highs, exerting pressuring on a major mining company. Major U.S. equities indexes finished higher to close out a volatile trading week as investors shook off concerns about bad loans at regional banks and U.S.-China trade tensions. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow each rose 0.5% Friday to post gains for the week. See here for more coverage from Investopedia of Friday's market moves. Kenvue (KVUE) stock bounced back on Friday, clawing back some of the heavy losses posted in the prior session after a lawsuit in the U.K. claimed that baby powder made by the consumer health products company was linked to cancer. Shares of the Band-Aid, Listerine, and Neutrogena parent company ended 8.4% higher, logging the top daily performance in the S&P 500. American Express (AXP) shares surged 7.3% to close at an all-time high after the company beat quarterly earnings estimates, with revenue climbing 11% year-over-year to a record $18.43 billion. Amex benefitted from the launch of updated high-end credit cards and strong spending trends among its affluent client base. Shares of fellow card issuer Capital One Financial (COF) gained 4% Friday, partly recovering from a downtick the prior day amid pressure on the financial sector. Gilead Sciences (GILD) shares added 4.2% following a price target boost by analysts at Goldman Sachs. Earlier this week, the biotechnology company presented positive results from a Phase 3 study of its cancer treatment Trodelvy. Truist Financial (TFC) also reported better-than-expected results for the third quarter, and shares of the financial services firm rose 3.7%. An uptick in fee income, boosted by strength in the wealth management and mortgage banking businesses, helped drive Truist's strong performance. Gold prices retreated from record levels, and shares of Newmont (NEM), the world's largest gold producer, dropped 7.6% Friday. The stock had reached an all-time high Thursday following a rally in parallel with the precious metal's push higher. Shares of Oracle (ORCL) sank close to 7%. Although the enterprise software giant provided targets for robust sales and profit growth through fiscal 2030, some Wall Street analysts raised concerns about a lack of details on Oracle's capital expenditure plans, as well as the company's heavy reliance on revenue from OpenAI and other major customers. Moderna (MRNA) shares lost 4.2%. Some analysts have voiced worries about declining revenue from the company's COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the company's limited headway on diversifying into other products.

Title: Microsoft laid her off. A layoff support group helped her bounce back — and she got a job at Meta 2 months later.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In May, after 14 years at Microsoft, Deborah Hendersen began to sense her time at the tech giant might be running out. Several colleagues on partner teams were among the roughly 6,000 employees laid off that month. The news made Hendersen, a user researcher in the company's Xbox division, worry that her group would be next. She said it eventually became the "worst-kept secret" that additional layoffs were coming, and that her team was likely to be affected. All she could do was hope to come out unscathed. "It wasn't so much like watching a car wreck," said the 45-year-old, who lives in Seattle. "It was more like you were in the car, knowing it was going to wreck." On July 2, her fears were confirmed. Hendersen was one of about 9,000 employees laid off as part of a sweeping companywide reduction. During previous rounds of layoffs she'd survived, Hendersen said it was often hard to tell who had been let go — something the company attributed to privacy concerns. But in her view, that lack of clarity made the experience more difficult for those still at the company, who were left guessing which colleagues had suddenly disappeared. "It's just very uncomfortable, in my experience, to not know who has been affected," she said. So rather than keeping her layoff a secret, she decided to make sure her network knew about it. The moment she received a mysterious meeting invite that she suspected would bring bad news, she started drafting messages to share internally and on LinkedIn. That decision didn't just bring emotional support — it also helped her land a new role at Meta two months later. Hendersen is among the thousands of Microsoft employees who've been laid off over the past year. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. However, the cuts have also affected individual contributors, such as Hendersen. Microsoft isn't alone. Google, Amazon, and Intel have also announced plans to shed workers. While layoffs remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been disproportionately affected, and a slowdown in white-collar hiring has made it harder for many to secure new roles. But in this challenging environment, some job seekers have found ways to break through. Hendersen shared how she responded to the layoff — and how she landed a job at Meta without ever applying. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Use a personal email address, a nonwork WiFi network, and a nonwork device; here’s our guide to sharing information securely. Read more on the topic: Hendersen's journey to a new role began less than an hour after she learned she'd been laid off, when she posted on LinkedIn to share the news. Next, while she still had access to her email, she messaged colleagues on her team, letting them know she'd lost her job — and hoping to identify others affected. As people replied, she added them to a Microsoft Teams group chat. Over the next week, the group of more than a dozen people became a support hub — where laid-off employees traded tips on how to file for unemployment and make sense of the HR materials they'd received. "I would vastly have preferred that I'd have been the only person who was laid off," Hendersen said. "But the fact that we could immediately build community was just incredibly helpful." Hendersen also took steps to prepare financially. When she first suspected a layoff might be coming, she and her husband sold some of their stock holdings to ensure they had enough cash on hand. They didn't know exactly what the severance package would look like, so they wanted to be ready. Once the layoff hit, Hendersen learned she'd continue receiving paychecks through late August, followed by a lump-sum severance payment based on her years of service. With that information, she and her husband analyzed their budget, determined how far their savings would take them, and identified expenses they could cut. She said the process was stressful. "There was very much a sense of stunning anxiety," she said. By reaching out to colleagues and preparing financially, Hendersen hoped to make the transition from Microsoft a little smoother. But she wanted to take some time to decompress and get organized before beginning her job search. "It had been 15 years since I'd updated my résumé in any meaningful way," she said. "I didn't have standardized cover letters. I didn't have all the little stories prepared that you're supposed to tell about yourself in interviews." However, Hendersen said she didn't decompress quite as much as she'd intended. After posting on LinkedIn, friends and former colleagues began reaching out about job opportunities, leading to informal conversations about whether they could be a good fit for her. "It was just like this ocean of warm hugs and kindness that came from people who were here to help me," she said. Support also came from the other laid-off Microsoft colleagues she'd organized in a Teams chat. Before losing access to their internal chat, the group transitioned to Discord, where they shared job opportunities, helped each other prepare for interviews, vented their frustrations, and celebrated their successes. Since Hendersen was finding opportunities through her network, she generally avoided the traditional application route. In total, she thinks she may have formally applied to one role. Relying on her network felt more manageable, especially since, after more than a decade out of the job market, she wasn't sure how to navigate online job searching. Typically, she would share her résumé with a connection, who would then refer her for a role. A recruiter would follow up to begin the process. In some cases, someone would flag an opening, and she'd message the recruiter directly, rather than applying online. One of the roles that was recommended to her was a user experience researcher position at Meta. Someone she knew at the company told her about the opening, which was similar to her role at Microsoft, where she'd conducted studies to evaluate how players interacted with games in development. The Meta role was under Reality Labs, the company's hardware and virtual reality division, and allowed her to work from Meta's Seattle office. Hendersen said the position seemed like a good fit, and after her connection referred her, she landed an interview. In late August, she received a job offer and started full-time in October. Hendersen said she came away from her job search with a few takeaways. First, it's important to develop a library of stories from your career that you can use in interviews. "You've done amazing things that people should be really impressed by," she said. "But can you remember them in the moment? That's so hard." She also recommends practicing how to tell those stories, especially to people who aren't in your field. When she interviewed at Meta, not everyone she spoke with came from the gaming world. That meant she had to explain her past work in a way that resonated with interviewers who didn't have the same level of expertise. Perhaps her biggest takeaway was the importance of supporting — and being supported by — others going through the same journey. "It's so helpful to have the support of other people who are going through it — both the highs and the lows," she said. "Because everybody gets turned down, gets their hopes up, and is just figuring out how to remain sane in a really challenging time."

Title: Black Women Leaders Found Joy And Reclaimed Their Resilience At The 2025 C-Suite Summit

ByDominique Fluker, Contributor. Black women are experiencing a reckoning. Many of us have found ourselves without a job this year due to mass layoffs, despite our capabilities and accomplishments. Throughout this year, you might’ve come across articles with the headline akin to, “350,000 Black Women Ousted From The Workforce,” highlighting the mass exodus of Black women professionals and documenting where we currently are professionally, despite the despite the grim reality many face. But what hasn’t been as explored are the resources being offered to help keep those who are still in corporate America encouraged, emotionally and spiritually—as many of colleagues, family members and broader community are looking to us for moral support, inspiration, leadership and refuge. Who do we turn to in the face of unprecedented change, confusion and heartache? Is there a soft place to land without judgment and high expectations to perform? That’s where the Martha’s Vineyard African American C-Suite Summit comes into play. Co-founder of Martha’s Vineyard African American Film Festival, Stephanie Tavares-Rance dreamt up the idea in 2019 to create a safe, tangible space for women occupying the highest levels of leadership. The idea morphed into an anticipated event of the Martha’s Vineyard African American Film Festival in 2021, initially as a C-suite luncheon, and has since expanded to include additional cities like Los Angeles, California, Denver, Colorado, and Atlanta, Georgia, featuring notable guests and speakers like April Ryan; Zola Mashariki, head of Audible Studios; Latasha Gillespie, global head of diversity, equity and inclusion at Amazon Studios; award-winning actress Uzo Adubo; and ​​Nicole Avant, to name a few. In October 2024, in the C-Suite Series, the experience evolved into a confluence of women leaders at the inaugural C-Suite Summit, which convened in beautiful Beaver Creek, Colorado, for attendees to “Exhale” and embrace wellness, networking, mentorship and inspiration. In all of these spaces, attendees are encouraged to cultivate new relationships and professional possibilities while engaging in provocative and intimate discussions. This year’s summit was aptly named “Resilience,” as multitudes of Black women are finding themselves in a precarious spot regarding their emotional bandwidth, stretching themselves at work by trying to keep their roles by any means necessary, or recovering from a layoff, while also balancing the stressors of their personal lives. Held from October 9 to 12, at the luxurious Park Hyatt Aviara, in Carlsbad, California, a Forbes Travel Guide Five-Star rated hotel, the summit, sponsored by Disney, L’Oreal Groupe, Carolina Herrera, Amazon MGM Studios, and ESPN, welcomed C-suite executives, entrepreneurs, A-list actresses, from across the country to convene, participate in transformative workshops, and listen to inspiring fireside chats rooted in reclaiming their resilience, while learning how to expand their professional footprint and deepen their influence and leadership skills. Beyond career strategy, the 2025 C-Suite Summit became a safe space for rest, joy, reflection, and establishing the balance in the face of professional turbulence, intentionally designed that way by Tavares-Rance and her team. From early morning Afro-Soca workouts sponsored by ESPN and hosted by Ariel Belgrave to workshops about how to reclaim resilience and position oneself for power from a health perspective, (both sessions led by chief executive officer Dr. Wizdom Powell and Dr. Kelly Elmore, GME president and OBGYN physician), the topic of the sessions showcased a need to focus on health and wellness, as a means of leverage within the workplace and beyond. Lunch-and-learn and fireside chat conversations with the likes of Vanessa Morrison, president of streaming at Walt Disney Studios, and others also proved meaningful, covering the gamut of aspirational career strategies and taking strategic leaps of faith to move forward in line with your purpose. Professional footprint and leadership skills takeaways from the workshop sessions throughtout the summit highlighted the importance of holistic healing (regulating and tending to your mind, body, and spirit) by doing activities that you once loved to do, actively receiving therapy or working with a life coach to understand previous trauma and address it, exploring ways how to bring your whole self to work, like being vulnerable and open. The sessions also guided attendees on how to regain confidence in themselves and work productively after a layoff or career shift, by encouraging them to be open to pivoting and to lean on authentic communities of support for referrals, advice, and job opportunities. Aside from purposeful discussions, the summit offered fun, joyful experiences such as rejuvenating spa sessions, yoga and an exclusive Amazon MGM screening of Hedda. As an attendee of the summit, I got a sense that Tavares-Rance designed this experience to be a safe space for Black women that went beyond the stuffy workshop sessions you may experience at corporate-based career summits and conferences; instead, she wanted to enrich and empower their spirits, especially after a turbulent and trying year. And she did. “I really believe that Black bodies deserve to be spoiled, and I wanted the summit not just to be entertainment focused, because that’s my background. I feel like as Black women, we’re just so siloed with our industries, but you never know where your next job opportunity, your next friendship, your next board position is going to come from," she tells me. "I wanted to create a space where all women from all over could come together, meet new people, be vulnerable, have a really good time, and spoil themselves with spas, hikes, and walks." Tavares-Rance shared that the goal of this summit was to let Black women know that they aren’t alone, no matter what industry they’re in. “Being a Black woman, we all go through the same challenges, and this space has let you know that you’re not alone and that we're here to help,” she says. While career growth and intentional expansion were at the center of the conference, another vital topic lingered—women’s health and self-care, which are critical to overall success and elevation in and out of the workplace. “I believe women’s health is so important, as well as our mental health. As women, we're just told to stuff down our trauma and put on our armor, go to the office, and be strong. And there's no place for us to be vulnerable. So I wanted to talk about things that matter to us at this summit,” she states. When it comes to this year’s summit title and theme, resilience, Tavares-Rance was clear about the intention: using joy as a form of resistance. “I think it's essential for us to realize that we're not alone, and our ancestors have been through much worse. I've chosen to focus on joy because I believe joy is a form of resistance. We are resilient, and the thought and the act of reclaiming our resilience has a lot to do with owning our power and our capabilities and not getting caught up in the title of your job,” she shares.

US banking sector concerns sparked a sell off in Europe with major banking stocks in Ireland and the UK tumbling, including Bank of Ireland, AIB, and Barclays. The Iseq All-Share index ended the session down 1.83 per cent on 11,438.22. Few of the big stocks ended in the black. Kerry Group was one, ending the day 0.78 per cent firmer on €77.45, alongside healthcare services group Uniphar plc, which was up 0.13 per cent. Irish Ferries brand owner Irish Continental Group also went against the tide to close 0.34 per cent ahead. The losses were led by Bank of Ireland and AIB which fell 5.7 per cent and 3.47 per cent respectively amid fears over credit quality in US regional banks which rippled through markets on Friday. Permanent TSB Group got off more lightly, falling 0.43 per cent to end the week on €2.29. Listed home builders also suffered, all ending in the red. Cairn Homes was down 2.07 per cent to €1.896. Glenveagh Properties was off 0.87 per cent and Irish Residential Properties REIT fell 1.07 per cent. Further share price drops came from wind and solar energy group Greencoat Renewables – down 2.62 per cent – and titanium minerals miner Kenmare Resources, which shed another 2.5 per cent at the end of a difficult week for the group. London’s benchmark index hit a two-week low on Friday, weighed down by losses in heavyweight lenders that joined a global sell-off in financial stocks. The benchmark FTSE 100 ended down 0.9 per cent at 9,353 points. Though off its session lows, the index still marked its second consecutive week in the red. The banks index shed 3.1 per cent. HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered fell 3 per cent, 5.4 per cent and 3.2 per cent respectively as investors revived memories of the crisis of confidence that shook sentiment just over two years ago. Defensive sectors were among those in positive territory, with personal goods, beverages, personal care, drug & grocery and utilities reflecting the cautious mood among investors. The aerospace and defence index dropped 3.5 per cent, tracking losses in European counterparts. Among other movers, precious metal miner Fresnillo slumped 11 per cent as gold and platinum prices tumbled. Pearson gained 2.5 per cent to the top of FTSE 100 as the education company expects stronger sales growth in the fourth quarter. Man Group gained 6.3 per cent after the hedge fund’s growth in assets under management surpassed expectations. The continent-wide STOXX 600 index closed nearly 1 per cent lower but still managed to log a modest weekly gain of 0.4 per cent. European banks were down 2.5 per cent, with Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Italy’s UniCredit and France’s BNP Paribas all losing between 3.3 per cent and 6.5 per cent. The flight to safety pushed gold to another record high of $4,378.69 per ounce. Luxury stocks helped cushion the broader market as Ray-Ban maker, EssilorLuxottica jumped 13 per cent on investor enthusiasm for its AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta glasses. Luxury was the best performing sector this week, powered by LVMH, which beat forecasts and reported its first quarterly sales rise this year. Continental was up 11.3 per cent after the German auto supplier’s preliminary third-quarter sales came in at €5 billion – just in advance of its own consensus forecast. All three major US stock indices were struggling for direction in midafternoon trading on Friday, while gold pulled back from all-time highs after a record run. Worries over potential systemic credit problems in the banking sector abated the day after Zions disclosed it would take a $50 million loan loss in the third quarter and Western Alliance initiated a lawsuit alleging fraud by an investment firm. The KBW Regional Banking index advanced in a partial recovery from Thursday’s 5 per cent plunge. Amid cooling of tariff rhetoric between Washington and Beijing, analysts now expect third-quarter S&P 500 earnings growth of 9.3 per cent year-on-year, up from 8.8 per cent as of October 1st, according to LSEG data. – Additional reporting, Reuters, PA.

Title: Micron Stock Slips From Record High Amid China Business Concerns—Watch These Key Price Levels

Micron Technology (MU) shares lost ground Friday following a report that the company will suspend some of its business in China. Reuters reported Friday that Micron will no longer supply server chips for data centers in China, after the business struggled following a ban imposed by Chinese authorities on use of the company's products in critical infrastructure. Micron will continue to sell chips to automotive and mobile phone sector customers in China, the report said. Micron shares were down 2% at around $198 in recent trading, after gaining more than 5% yesterday as Wall Street analysts offered bullish commentary on the stock. Analysts at UBS raised their price target on the stock to $245, noting that Micron should benefit from "intensifying" memory and storage hardware shortages. Citi lifted its target to $240 and said the company sits well positioned to team up with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which has recently stuck deals with Nvidia (NVDA), Advance Micro Devices (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO). Through midday Friday, Micron shares had gained 135% since the start of the year and were up 19% in October, as investors bet that surging AI date-center demand will fuel a memory chip boom. Below, we break down the technicals on Micron’s chart and point out key price levels that investors will likely be watching. After climbing above $200 for the first time earlier this month, Micron shares consolidated in a pennant before breaking out from the pattern on Thursday. Importantly, the move occurred on the highest trading volume in more than three weeks, potentially laying the groundwork for a continuation move higher. While the relative strength index sits near its overbought threshold, the indicator still remains significantly below its June and September peaks that preceded consolidation periods, indicating the stock has ample room for the recent uptrend to continue. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast where Micron’s price may be headed next and also point out key support levels worth watching during pullbacks in the stock. Investors can forecast where Micron shares may be headed by using bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes prior trends to project future directional movements. When applying the analysis to the chipmaker's chart, we take the stock’s strong move higher that immediately preceded the pennant and reposition it from Thursday’s breakout point near the pattern’s top trendline. This indicates the share price could rapidly climb to around $245 if a continuation move plays out. During pullbacks, investors should initially watch the $158 level. This area could offer support near the prominent June 2024 swing high and a minor dip on the chart in September this year after an impulsive move higher. Finally, a more-significant drop could see Micron shares revisit lower support near the key $130 level. Investors may look to set buy limit orders in this location near the top of a prior symmetrical triangle, which closely aligns with major peaks on the chart in April 2024 and June this year.

The company, which provides in-person and virtual care tailored to women, cut 27% of its corporate team, or 17 people; 22% of its providers, or 27 people; and 23% of its field support team, or 28 people, according to an email to employees sent Monday evening by Tia CEO Felicity Yost. Tia's layoffs show how even buzzy, well-funded startups are being forced to reckon with healthcare's economic pressures against venture capital's growth expectations. Once a rising star backed by Melinda French Gates, Tia is now under pressure to prove that its hybrid model of tech-enabled women's clinics can actually turn a profit. The demise of similar healthcare startups like former Silicon Valley darling Forward has shown how hard tech-enabled healthcare can be to scale; even Amazon owned-health clinic company One Medical has struggled with profitability. Tia confirmed the layoffs in a statement to Business Insider. Tia operates as a one-stop healthcare shop for women, providing services from gynecology and primary care to mental healthcare, with options for in-person and virtual care. The startup runs 11 clinics, according to its website, including six locations in Los Angeles, two in New York City, one in San Francisco, and two in Arizona. Yost told employees in her email that the layoffs were a response to feedback Tia received in a recent fundraise. Yost said Tia sought that funding after its business's underperformance meant Tia would not be able to reach profitability without more cash. The feedback from the fundraise "required us to rethink our business in the current economic and policy climate, which is one that prizes cost and profit-consciousness," Yost said in her email. "We must manage towards a faster timeline to be corporate-level profitable than we previously contemplated." "Tia has seen strong growth, particularly in membership, which has outpaced our expectations for 2025. At the same time, we're facing ongoing structural challenges impacting the broader care delivery sector, such as cost pressures from rising labor rates and tighter reimbursement rates, which require us to be more disciplined in our operations," a Tia spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. In-person clinics have proven difficult to sustain financially, even for well-funded healthcare companies. Forward shut down abruptly in November 2024 after raising over $650 million to scale its tech-driven clinics and automated "CarePods." Primary care chain VillageMD has begun selling its clinics after spinning off from Walgreens in the retailer's sale to Sycamore Partners in August; Walgreens had announced plans to close 160 VillageMD clinics in April 2024 to curb losses. Walmart shuttered all 51 of its health centers later in April, citing a lack of profitability. While Tia hasn't announced a round of funding since its $100 million Series B in 2021, Yost's email to employees references Tia's "Series C growth plan." Tia didn't respond to a question from Business Insider about its Series C. The startup also raised an undisclosed amount of Series B extension funding from Melinda French Gates' Pivotal Ventures in 2023, which Tia said brought its total funding to $150 million. "Across healthcare, we're seeing organizations respond to market trends that favor operational efficiency, sustainable growth, and sharper financial discipline. Tia is doing the same, and from a position of strength," the Tia spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that Tia has more health system partnerships and expansion announcements planned for early next year. Yost said in her email to employees that the fires in Los Angeles in early January had challenged Tia's business in the first quarter. She also cited "slower than necessary growth that hampered our business." Tia introduced new projects in the second quarter, "meant to counteract the dip in Q1 performance," Yost wrote. Those initiatives included a new model to allow patients to get care from Tia without becoming a member, a partnership for Tia members to access compounded GLP-1 prescriptions, and a national rollout of Tia's virtual care services. While the new no-membership-required model outperformed expectations, Yost said, underperformance across the rest of the business led Tia to seek additional funding because "we would not achieve profitability with our existing cash runway, as planned." Yost said Tia did ultimately secure additional funding, but received feedback in the process that led to the layoffs. Yost and Witte started Tia in 2016, focusing on in-person clinics. The startup began rolling out virtual care services in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and later shifted to a hybrid model. Tia's last reported layoff occurred in July 2022, as Business Insider reported the following November. Tia cofounder and then-CEO Carolyn Witte told BI that the layoffs were a preemptive response to the market downturn so Tia could continue to grow responsibly. Witte stepped down as Tia's CEO in April 2024 and into the role of Tia's chairwoman. Witte said a LinkedIn post about her departure from the role that Yost, formerly Tia's president, would serve as Tia's interim CEO. A Tia spokesperson told Business Insider after publication that Witte had stepped down as board chair shortly after departing the CEO position. Yost is now Tia's permanent CEO. In addition to the layoffs, Yost said in her Monday email that Tia would make significant changes to its operating expenses, including to its tools and contracts, and cut compensation for its senior leaders. Yost also said that Tia could no longer afford to hire clinical roles ahead of demand and "must creatively rethink how we optimize our administrative and care support roles across a broader range of responsibilities." She said the startup aims to make these changes without compromising its high-quality patient care standards. Employees affected by the Tuesday layoffs, including patient-facing providers, were cut off from Tia's systems immediately following the email.

Title: These Beloved Fast Food Chains Are Losing Their Edge In 2025, According To Customers
URL: https://www.mashed.com/1994565/beloved-fast-food-chains-getting-worse-2025/
Time Published: 2025-10-17T16:33:00Z
Full Content:
The success of a fast food chain often depends in equal parts on nostalgia and change. On one hand, a fair number of, say, McDonald's customers are perpetually chasing the taste of a Quarter Pounder from their youth. On the other hand, virtually all leading fast food companies continually keep their menus fresh with limited-time offerings or updated recipes, ensuring there's always a new reason to visit. Domino's even overhauled its pizza recipe entirely in the late 2010s and never looked back, permanently altering its flagship offering. Sometimes change is helpful, like in the case of Domino's. But, occasionally, a major change or series of changes at a fast food chain is so detrimental that the classic, nostalgic experience is pretty much lost. In 2025 alone, more than a handful of beloved fast food chains have changed for the worse and started to lose their edge, according to online comments from customers. Isolating the most significant fast food chains declining in 2025 first meant identifying chains with a pronounced downturn, as opposed to a years-long, persistent lull. Furthermore, since the price of fast food is up across the board, complaints from customers needed to cite more than just higher prices. Based on those criteria, then, the following are all popular fast food chains that customers think have lost their edge. Signs that Wendy's was struggling were apparent by the end of 2024, and plenty of customers started to notice those struggles affecting the quality of the Wendy's experience the following year. Pivotal to the chain's decline — and something that started to become evident in 2024 — has been a decrease in the quality of the food. Customers have noticed classic items like the Baconator and the Vanilla Frosty, among others, tasting worse than they remember. Another common critique of Wendy's restaurants is that they're insufficiently staffed. Issues with understaffing recounted by customers in 2025 have included closed drive-thrus, odd hours, and an inefficient ordering system. One Reddit user posted about a series of Wendy's closures in their area, all roughly within the last year, and theorized this was ultimately the fault of the chain no longer delivering on the higher level of quality for which it was once known. "I don't know what the quality control at Wendy's is, but in my opinion, they need to start reigning in the franchises and really look at how the food is getting made," they wrote. "[Wendy's] has always been the more expensive fast food option versus McDonald's or Burger King, but for that price, you used to be guaranteed a certain quality. When the quality is gone, there's really no reason to go there instead of the cheaper option at McDonald's." While the consensus among customers that Wendy's is struggling is a relatively new phenomenon, the decline of Pizza Hut has taken place on a considerably lengthier timeline. Pizza Hut was disappearing across the country in 2020, for example. Nevertheless, things have only gotten worse for the chain in 2025. In response to a post about a particularly low-quality stuffed-crust pizza, for example, a former Pizza Hut manager on Reddit claimed that the chain's dough, cheese, and sauce recipes all changed for the worse in or around 2025. Perhaps even more notable to the Pizza Hut story, however, is the fact that the chain switched from in-house delivery drivers to partnerships with third-party delivery apps in 2025. Many customers are unhappy about this change, generally preferring the experience of dealing with a local Pizza Hut store employee over DoorDash or Uber Eats systems. Even former Pizza Hut employees are denouncing the chain and warning other potential customers away. "As a former Pizza Hut delivery driver, because they gave us two days' notice before they told us they were going 100% DoorDash, I agree," wrote a user on Reddit, in response to a critique of the new DoorDash system. Chipotle has always been a little divisive. For its proponents, items like the burrito bowl make for a fast, largely affordable, and relatively healthy lunch. But to the chain's critics, there are some secrets Chipotle doesn't want the public to know. Some of these suggest a business that doesn't always live up to its own ethos. As much as Chipotle has always faced criticism, some noteworthy changes to the company have negatively affected its 2025 trajectory in particular. Emblematic of Chipotle's 2025 struggles, to the extent it inspired a dedicated Reddit thread, was a significant stock price drop in July. Near the end of 2024, Chipotle hired a new CEO, and some commenters blamed him for the chain's downturn. One analysis of his impact suggested that a purported push to increase Chipotle's volume of catering orders was energy best spent elsewhere. More impactful, this analysis suggested, would be increasing portion sizes. Portion sizes decreasing was, indeed, a complaint shared in numerous posts commenting on the stock price drop. "I was a near-daily Chipotle guy for 10 years," wrote one Reddit user. "Not only did the meat quality nosedive, but as others have mentioned, the portion size reduced by about 33%. I'm done with Chipotle." Like Chipotle, Chick-fil-A elicits strong feelings, both from fans of the chain and those who claim there are better chicken sandwiches at competing restaurants. While Chick-fil-A may cycle limited-time offerings in and out of its rotation, it's the regular chicken sandwich, basic waffle fries, and even its signature chicken nuggets that keep customers coming back — all simple, year-round staples. But as much as Chick-fil-A is reliant on its steadfast classics, some customers are noticing that, classics though they may be, they're just not hitting like they used to. Chick-fil-A made two notable changes to its most popular items. First, in 2024, the chain replaced its antibiotic-free chicken with chicken it describes as raised with no antibiotics important to human medicine. Whether or not that change is resulting in lower quality chicken is up for debate, but regardless, a fair number of Chick-fil-A customers have found that its chicken has gone downhill. Then, in 2025, the chain altered its fry recipe. The big difference compared to the old fries is that the new style of fry is coated in pea starch, intended to keep an order crispier for longer. While that does seem to be working as intended, plenty of fans of Chick-fil-A's classic waffle fries are straight up unhappy with the new recipe's flavor. "Literally tastes like oil, they stick together, and it's not even worth heating up. I'd rather take the soggier ones than what they did this time around," wrote one Reddit user. Around the start of 2024, there were already signs that Panera Bread might not be around much longer. The issues the soup and sandwich chain was facing at that time seem to have only gotten worse, given the volume of customers who noticed the quality drop off in 2025. In a Reddit thread about overrated fast food chains, for example, the two comments with the most upvotes — more than twice as many as the third-most upvoted comment — mentioned Panera. While customers have found that Panera has been steadily declining over the years, the chain announced in July of 2025 that it would no longer prepare its own fresh dough. For those who were already starting to feel iffy about the state of Panera in 2025, this decision was just about the opposite of what the chain needed to win back some goodwill. "Panera's initial concept was that there was a lack of neighborhood bakeries in the U.S., particularly in suburban areas," wrote one Reddit user. "That concept is long gone. There's nothing that makes products at Panera better than elsewhere. You can get similar products in so many places. Sometimes the grocery store selling pre-made sandwiches is in the same strip mall, and it's just as good and cheaper." Sonic Drive-In is sort of a black sheep in the fast-food chain restaurant world. While most fast food chains have a signature item or items, there's no single must-have at Sonic. Rather, it's the chain's old-school drive-in concept that it's most well-known for. Indicative of Sonic's 2025 decline is the fact that some Sonics have closed down the drive-in stalls at times, instead urging customers to order in the drive-thru. A price reason for Sonic's 2025 trajectory is unclear, but that trajectory has been clear enough to inspire multiple online discussions about a sudden lack of quality Sonic restaurants. It's not just the drive-in experience that has been impacted, either. Customers have reported issues with Sonic's food, ranging from overcooked burgers to excessively sweet drinks to drinks being watered down. "I'd like Sonic if it would build its products right," wrote one Reddit user. "Every time I go, all the stuff is on one side of the main item. Like a chili cheese dog with half the wiener exposed. Full serving of chili and cheese falling off the other end. A burger with a patty in the middle of the bun, but half the patty naked and the other half with full portions of everything. It doesn't matter how slow it is or which location I go to." The same way In-N-Out is a business in which Californians take pride — even if its footprint technically extends to a handful of additional states — Whataburger is a Texas chain through and through. Discussion of Whataburger's decline kicked off in a major way around the end of 2024, when The Dallas Observer published an article agreeing with a December Washington Post piece suggesting that Whataburger had fallen off. That sentiment persisted into the following year. Texans recounted issues with the chain in 2025, ranging from cold food to excessive wait times to insufficiently portioned ingredients. Its fries in particular garnered significant criticism — the chain's burgers are cooked to order, sometimes leaving an order of fries to sit out for some time. Even if this practice may have affected orders in the past, customers have shared that in 2025 in particular, subpar fries started to become increasingly common. "Lifelong Whataburger diner here — I am 61," one Reddit user posted. "In my last couple of experiences have noticed a different taste. Last night, I had French fries that were "rubbery," not crisp or fresh like the kind that you find at In-n-Out. I am so disappointed that I want a refund." California has In-N-Out, Texas has Whataburger, and Chicago has Portillo's. From famously delicious hot dogs to Italian beef sandwiches to a famed chocolate cake shake — made with a blended chocolate cake slice — Portillo's specializes in indulgent favorites from Chicago and the Midwest. In 2025, Portillo's attempted to expand significantly outside of Chicago with restaurants smaller than the average Chicago location, focused on quick service. That plan fell so short of expectations, Portillo's parted ways with its CEO in September. Amidst this discord and its inevitable financial impact, customers have noticed the quality of the food at Portillo's locations dropping off. One customer, for example, noted that the size of its Italian beef sandwiches is shrinking. Other customers have noticed that items like the beef and cheddar croissant pretty much never include adequate cheese. "Now every time I go, they always mess up my order, sometimes the cheese on my beef and cheddar croissant isn't even melted," wrote one Reddit user. "I've watched my bag just sit on the counter, ready to get pushed out, while other people are getting theirs. Just not the same anymore."

Will cut 9,000 employees, which is less than 4% of its global workforce across teams, role types, and geographies. The reduction follows a series of layoffs earlier this year: It cut less than 1% of the headcount in January, more than 6,000 in May, and at least 300 in June. Is laying off 65 employees in Bellevue, Washington, according to media reports. The parent company of TikTok arrived in Seattle in 2021 and has been expanding its presence there by growing its TikTok Shop online shopping division. Announced on June 30 that the company is cutting 300 jobs, or 10% of its workforce, as part of organizational restructuring within its sales and support divisions amid the AI shift. The startup is an Amsterdam-based location tech startup that provides navigation and mapping products. Has reduced its headcount by approximately 140 employees, accounting for roughly 1% of its total workforce. The recent layoffs mostly affected Rivian’s manufacturing team.

Announced that it is letting go of around 90 employees, with 40 in Israel and 50 in Poland. The most recent round of job cuts comes after the Israel-based gaming company laid off 50 employees a few weeks ago.

Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) shares slumped in early trading Friday after President Trump promised to lower the prices of popular weight-loss drugs, such as Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Eli Lilly’s Zepbound. In comments to reporters during a White House event Thursday, Trump said prices could drop to $150 a month from $1,300. When asked which treatment he meant, Trump pointed to Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic, saying prices for weight-loss drugs like it will be "much lower." Ozempic’s current list price is $1,000 a month, but Novo Nordisk offers it to consumers buying in cash without insurance for less. Dr. Mehmet Oz, head of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), said the CMS has not yet finished negotiating costs with pharmaceutical firms. Shares of Novo Nordisk were down about 4% in recent trading, while shares of Eli Lilly dropped 3%. President Trump’s recent comments come amid a broader effort by the administration to cut drug prices in the U.S. to align with lower international rates. A Novo Nordisk spokesperson told Investopedia the company has engaged with the Trump administration, and "will continue to work to find solutions that help people access the medication they need." U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk have lost more than a third of their value this year as the company faces growing competition in the weight-loss drug market. Shares of Eli Lilly have added about 3%.

Title: Expansion of the functional genomics GRACE library reveals genes relevant for temperature-dependent fitness in Candida albicans
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003409
Time Published: 2025-10-17T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
A small percentage of species in the fungal kingdom can cause devastating infections in humans, with Candida albicans reigning as a leading cause of systemic disease. One of the key virulence phenotypes for pathogenic fungi is the ability to survive at host body temperature; however, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate thermal adaptation in fungi remains incomplete. In this study, we expand the largest functional genomics resource in C. albicans, reaching 71.3% coverage of the entire genome, and perform screens under six different temperatures to identify genes important for temperature-dependent fitness. We describe the function of genes involved in translation (GAR1), splicing (C1_11680C or YSF3), and cell cycle progression (C6_00110C or RHT1) in enabling fungal survival at both low and high temperatures. Through experimental evolution, we also show that C. albicans can rapidly overcome deleterious mutations and adapt to extreme temperature environments. Overall, our study highlights the transformative potential of genome-wide functional genomics to uncover critical vulnerabilities in pathogenic fungi.

Among the estimated 5 million fungal species, only a few hundred can cause infections in humans [2]. One of the major barriers restricting fungal species from becoming human pathogens is the ability to grow at human physiological temperature [3]. However, climate change has been implicated in enabling thermal adaptation in fungi, facilitating geographical spread of endemic fungal diseases, and expanding the human fungal pathogen repertoire [4,5]. For example, higher global temperatures have been suggested to promote the spread of the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus deuterogattii, which is more thermotolerant than other species in the same Cryptococcus gattii species complex [6,7]. Another emerging fungal pathogen, Candida auris, first identified from an ear infection in 2009 in Japan, is now a significant public health concern causing nosocomial outbreaks in hospitals globally [8,9]. Importantly, the global emergence of C. auris as a human pathogen is hypothesized to stem from adaptations driven by climate change, allowing it to transition from historically environmental niches to human hosts [10]. Thus, understanding how fungi adapt to extreme temperatures is critical to understand how these species spread and cause disease in human hosts. Deviation from optimal growth temperatures at times induces a temperature shock that disrupts protein homeostasis, challenges cellular physiological state, and jeopardizes fungal survival [11]. In response to temperature upshifts, fungal cells employ a conserved heat shock response, involving reprogramming of gene expression to repress protein biosynthesis and up-regulating cytoprotective heat shock protein-encoding genes. Two of the key players in that response are heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and heat shock transcription factor 1 (Hsf1), which are conserved from yeasts to humans. In the commensal fungal pathogen Candida albicans, the Hsf1-Hsp90 autoregulatory circuit governs the cellular transcriptional response to heat stress [12]. Upon transient heat shock, C. albicans cells rapidly up-regulate over 12% of the genome in an Hsp90-dependent manner with gene functions enriched in the unfolded protein response, proteasome/ubiquitination, oxidative stress response, cell cycle, biofilm formation, and pathogenesis [13]. Hsp90 orchestrates this transcriptional response by modulating chromatin nucleosome positioning enabling transcriptional regulation by Hsf1 [13]. Additional cellular stress response pathways are implicated in tolerance to extreme temperatures as well. In the opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, calcineurin, a conserved calcium-calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine-specific phosphatase modulates heat stress to enable cell survival, and the cold stress response is regulated by the phosphatase Gpp2, a target of the Hog pathway [14–17]. Furthermore, biofilms, or surface-associated communities, have been shown to enhance fungal tolerance to both heat and cold stresses [18]. Due to the pleiotropic effects of these temperature shock defense mechanisms, heat/cold stress adaptation is often accompanied by broader physiological changes, leading to alterations in the cell cycle, transcription, translation, and metabolic processes, which can enhance the potential for fungal pathogenesis [4,11]. With the growing threat of fungal pathogens to human health, the antifungal arsenal remains limited, consisting of only three major classes of antifungal drugs (polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins) targeting essential functions [19]. Unfortunately, each of these antifungal classes is limited by significant host toxicity issues, limited spectrum of activity, and/or the frequent development of resistance [20]. Moreover, heat stress has been shown to induce aneuploidy formation in all major fungal pathogens, including C. albicans, to enable antifungal drug tolerance and resistance [21]. Amid the threat of climate change, fungal pathogens are primed to gain the upper hand in the ongoing antifungal arms race, highlighting the urgency in understanding fungal thermal adaptation. In C. albicans, genetic mutant libraries have enabled large-scale functional genomic screens to identify and characterize genes that govern fungal survival, virulence, and pathogenesis [22–27]. One of the largest functional genomic resources in C. albicans is the Gene Replacement and Conditional Expression (GRACE) collection consisting of heterozygous deletion mutants, where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele is regulated by a doxycycline (DOX)-repressible promoter [23]. Upon its original release, this collection consisted of mutants representing 2,326 genes or ~37% of the 6,198 genes in the C. albicans genome [23]. Genomic coverage increased to 48% with the release of an expanded set of mutants representing 866 genes (GRACEv2) [25]. However, despite the instrumental role this collection has made in furthering our understanding of C. albicans biology [27], over half of the genome has yet to be investigated to identify genes required for important biological traits, including growth at extreme temperatures. Here, we introduce the expansion of GRACE mutants, bringing the cumulative coverage of the GRACE library to 71.3% of the C. albicans genome. Screening of the expanded GRACE library at multiple temperatures identified hundreds of genes that are important for fitness, many of which were selectively required for growth at extreme temperatures. Through the integration of phenotypic clustering, structural similarity analyses, and experimental evolution, we described the function of genes involved in translation (GAR1), splicing (C1_11680C or YSF3), and cell cycle progression (C6_00110C or RHT1). Furthermore, through experimental evolution, we showed that C. albicans can rapidly overcome deleterious mutations via diverse mechanisms in response to high temperature. Overall, this work significantly expands a critical functional genomics resource in C. albicans and characterizes the function of unknown genes with temperature-dependent importance for fitness in this human fungal pathogen. Despite the clinical importance of C. albicans, our understanding of this fungal pathogen remains incomplete due to a lack of comprehensive mutant collections to interrogate gene function. Thus, we first sought to expand the GRACE collection to improve genome coverage. Specifically, C. albicans heterozygous deletion mutants marked with strain-specific molecular barcodes [23] were transformed with a DNA construct consisting of a nourseothricin (NAT)-resistance marker, a DOX-repressible promoter, and homologous sequences to drive homologous recombination immediately upstream of the start codon of the target gene of the remaining allele (Fig 1A). Through this approach, we generated 1,240 novel GRACE strains (GRACEv3) representing 1,228 genes absent from the previous two iterations, expanding genome coverage of this collection from ~48% to ~71% (Fig 1B). For those strains present in the GRACE collection, genes were grouped into broad categories based on manual curation of their annotation status from the Candida Genome Database (CGD) in the gene ontology category of “biological process” [28]. Specifically, genes were determined to have been annotated (i) directly with experimental characterization in C. albicans, (ii) indirectly with conservation in sequence and/or protein domains to other fungal species, or (iii) unannotated based on evidence codes denoting the type of experiments or prediction data presented to support functional annotations. Construction of GRACEv1 and v2 libraries was guided by orthologous gene functions covering all major biological processes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Thus, unannotated genes only make up 11.6% and 15.4% of genes in these two iterations [23,25] (Figs 1B and S1A). In contrast, the construction of GRACEv3 library was not guided by gene functions in S. cerevisiae, resulting in the inclusion of 375 genes (30.6%) lacking functional annotations (Figs 1B and S1A). The remaining ~50% of unannotated genes in the C. albicans genome will benefit from continued efforts of library expansion. A) Schematic of GRACE mutant construction.

To do so, the arrayed GRACEv3 library was grown in liquid culture with a high concentration (100 μg/mL) of DOX before transferring onto solid medium containing 100 μg/mL DOX in technical duplicate to ensure maximum transcriptional repression. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. Colony images were scored independently by two researchers from 0 to 4, with 4 representing no growth and 0 representing growth comparable to wild type [25] (Figs 1C and S1B). Given the importance of thermotolerance for the success of C. albicans as a human fungal pathogen, we also screened the entire GRACE collection (v1, v2, and v3) for growth at elevated temperature (39 °C) using an analogous approach. Screening results for the GRACEv3 collection at 30 °C were compiled alongside previous results from the v1 and v2 collections [25] and compared to those obtained at 39 °C. This revealed 793 and 887 genes that were important for C. albicans fitness at 30 and 39 °C, respectively, with 734 genes that were important at both temperatures (essentiality score >1, Figs 1C and S1C). To further interrogate the role of temperature in C. albicans fitness, we arrayed 947 strains that showed moderate to severe growth defects (average score > 1 in the presence of DOX) in our initial screen (Fig 1C). To avoid preselection for genes important for fitness during adaptation to DOX suppression, mutants were grown overnight in liquid culture in the absence or presence of 0.5 µg/mL DOX at 30 °C. Mutants were then spotted onto agar plates in the presence and absence of 100 µg/mL DOX and incubated at six different temperatures (16, 22, 30, 37, 39, and 40.5 °C). At the respective timepoints, plates were imaged, and growth of mutants was scored independently by three individuals and averaged to obtain a final growth score for each mutant (S1D Fig and S1 Data). Compared to the 887 strains that were annotated with an essentiality score >1 at 39 °C in the initial screen, 648 strains scored >1 at 39 °C in the secondary screen, suggesting lower DOX pretreatment enabled a more fine-tuned assessment of genes important for fitness at different temperatures (S1 Data). Mutants were then organized by hierarchical clustering of growth scores across screened temperatures to identify clusters of genes with minimal to moderate importance for growth (cluster 4), as well as temperature-independent (cluster 1), heat-sensitive (clusters 2 and 6), cold-sensitive (cluster 3), and extreme temperature-sensitive (cluster 5) phenotypes (Fig 1D). To identify functional enrichment within each cluster, gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using the 947 genes screened as the background (Fig 1E). As expected, mutants displaying temperature-independent essentiality (cluster 1) were enriched for core biological processes like ‘translation’ and ‘protein metabolic process’, which are indispensable for survival. Cold tolerance genes (cluster 3) showed significant enrichment of various RNA metabolism and regulatory-related processes. Additionally, the GO term “filamentation in response to pH” was enriched in cluster 5, which consisted of genes essential for survival at both low and high temperatures. Finally, genes grouped together based on essentiality at extreme high temperatures (cluster 6) were enriched for functions related to cell cycle, filamentation, and stress response, biological processes previously shown to be important for thermotolerance [13,29]. Overall, this highlights that genes involved in similar biological processes often cluster together based on growth phenotypes at different temperatures. The findings from our functional genomic screen revealed a distinct set of genes required for growth, particularly at elevated temperature, many of which were uncharacterized or poorly characterized based on S. cerevisiae orthologs. One of these genes from cluster 6 was the putative H/ACA snoRNP pseudouridylation complex protein, Gar1. Pseudouridylation is the most abundant RNA modification in noncoding RNAs in all living organisms and plays essential roles in transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) functions [30]. To verify the importance of GAR1 for C. albicans growth at elevated temperature, we performed spot dilution assays with the tetO-GAR1/Δ strain in the absence and presence of DOX and observed a severe growth defect at all temperatures tested upon DOX-mediated transcriptional repression, particularly at 22 and 40.5 °C (Figs 2A and S2A). To confirm the importance of GAR1 for C. albicans fitness, a homozygous deletion mutant was constructed and assessed for growth at different temperatures. Similar to the GRACE strain, spot dilution assay confirmed the importance of this gene for C. albicans fitness, particularly at 40.5 °C where no growth was observed for the deletion mutant. Complementation of the deletion mutant with two wild-type alleles (GAR1A/A) resulted in growth phenotypes similar to wild type (Fig 2B). A) Strains were grown overnight in YPD with or without 0.05 µg/mL DOX and spotted in 10-fold dilutions starting from an OD600 of 0.8 onto YPD with or without 100 µg/mL DOX.

The data underlying Fig 2C, 2D and 2G can be found in S1 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003409.g002 In S. cerevisiae, the box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex converts uridine into pseudouridine in rRNAs and consists of four core proteins (Cbf5, Nop10, Nhp2, and Gar1), one RNA-binding protein (Naf1), and one chaperone (Shq1) [31–33]. Spot dilution assays confirmed the importance of the C. albicans core genes for growth at all temperatures. In contrast, the chaperone SHQ1 had the least impact on fitness across all temperatures compared to other genes of the box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex (S2A and S3 Figs). These observations suggest Gar1 may be partially dispensable for complex function under optimal conditions, but becomes absolutely required at extreme temperatures. The box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex is important for rRNA pseudouridylation modifications and maturation in S. cerevisiae [33,34]. To investigate the role of Gar1 in C. albicans, we quantified the presence of precursor internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) by qRT-PCR. During rRNA maturation, ITS1 and ITS2 are cleaved from precursor rRNAs to form mature 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNAs [35]. Deletion of GAR1 resulted in significant increases in ITS1 and ITS2 relative to wild-type and complemented strains (Fig 2C), similar to what was observed upon depletion of the core H/ACA ribonucleoprotein CBF5 (S2A and S2B Fig), supporting a role of Gar1 in rRNA maturation (Fig 2C). Defects in rRNA maturation ultimately result in impaired translation [36]. Hence, we performed a fluorescence-based assay to monitor translation activity in the presence or absence of GAR1 [37]. An alkynylated methionine analog, l-homopropargylglycine (HPG), was used to label newly synthesized proteins, and a click reaction of the alkyne with a fluorescent azide provided a fluorescent readout of the translation activity. Treatment of wild-type cells with the translation inhibitor anisomycin or deletion of GAR1 reduced the fluorescent signal compared to wild type or the complemented control. Wild-type cells treated with the non-translation inhibitor fluconazole did not show reduced fluorescent signal, confirming the reduction in fluorescence intensity was not simply due to reduced cell growth (Fig 2D). To further elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying Gar1’s role in temperature-dependent essentiality, we devised a selection strategy to identify mutants with a restored ability to grow at elevated temperature. To this end, we plated 108 gar1Δ/Δ cells on agar plates, incubated the cells at 42 °C for 14 days, and successfully isolated one bypass mutant (ByM1) that was able to grow at 40.5 °C (Figs 2B and S4A) and partially restored ITS1 and ITS2 to wild-type-like levels (Fig 2C). Whole genome sequencing analysis of the evolved mutant showed no aneuploidy or copy number variation in comparison to the reference SC5314 genome or compared to the gar1 mutant from which it was derived (Fig 2E). Variant calling identified a mutation in KRR1 in the LOH region (cyan) on Chr1 at position 109, resulting in an amino acid substitution at position 37 from glutamic acid (E) to lysine (K). KRR1 encodes a nucleolar protein functioning in the 90S pre-ribosome facilitating pre-rRNA cleavage during rRNA maturation [38]. To confirm this substitution was sufficient for the restored growth observed at elevated temperature, we replaced both KRR1 alleles in the gar1 mutant with those identified in ByM1 (Krr1E37K) and confirmed this strain was able to grow at high temperature (Fig 2F). To confirm this substitution was necessary for the growth at elevated temperatures, we replaced both KRR1 alleles in ByM1 with those from the parental gar1 mutant (Krr1K37E), which resulted in a loss of growth at 40.5 °C (Fig 2F). Finally, we evaluated whether the temperature-dependent essentiality of GAR1 plays a role in virulence using the wax moth Galleria mellonella model at both 28 and 39 °C [27]. This invertebrate model has successfully been used to study C. albicans pathogenesis and highlight those genes important for C. albicans virulence in a temperature-dependent manner [27,39]. We infected larvae by proleg injection with wild-type, gar1Δ/Δ, or complemented strains and incubated the G. mellonella at 28 or 39 °C. Deletion of GAR1 significantly attenuated virulence at both temperatures compared to wild-type and the complemented strain with a greater significance at 39 °C, confirming the importance of Gar1 in C. albicans pathogenesis in vivo, especially at human febrile temperature (Fig 2G). Overall, these experiments support the role of Gar1 in thermal tolerance and highlight the increased dependency on translation and rRNA processing at elevated temperature for C. albicans. While the ability of C. albicans to survive within the human host requires it to thrive at physiological and febrile temperatures, this organism also causes a significant number of chronic mucocutaneous infections on the skin, nails, and other mucous membranes, and can survive on different environmental surfaces [40,41]. This requires C. albicans to grow at temperatures below 37 °C. Thus, to investigate which genes are specifically important for growth at lower temperature (cluster 3), we focused on the uncharacterized gene C1_11680C lacking functional annotation on CGD [28]. Using spot dilution assays on YPD agar plates with and without DOX, we confirmed transcriptional repression of C1_11680C impaired fitness at all temperatures, with a more severe growth defect observed at temperatures below 37 °C (Figs 3A and S2A). While we were unable to identify a potential homolog based on DNA sequence comparisons with S. cerevisiae, BLASTp searches against S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe genomes predicted C1_11680c as a splicing factor (Ysf3) belonging to the SF3b subcomplex of the U2 snRNP [42–45]. Template modeling (TM) of the predicted C. albicans C1_11680c structure with S. cerevisiae Ysf3 and S. pombe Sap10 by AlphaFold [46] yielded TM-align [47] scores above 0.7, supporting C1_11680c as Ysf3 in C. albicans (Fig 3B).

Spot dilution assays confirmed that across all temperatures depletion of RDS3 and RSE1 had little to no impact on fitness, whereas depletion of HSH49 and HSH155 caused severe growth defects, with HSH155 being essential (S2A and S5A Figs). Interestingly, depletion of CUS1 resulted in similar growth phenotype across all temperatures tested to depletion of YSF3 (S5A Fig). This highlights the differential dependency of various splicing genes in fitness across different temperatures. To test the hypothesis that C1_11680C encodes Ysf3 and is important for C. albicans splicing, we examined the splicing efficiency of the ACT1 transcript upon depletion of YSF3. We also included the tetO-PRP19/Δ strain, as PRP19 is known to be important for splicing of ACT1 in C. albicans [49]. To avoid potential off-target effects by DOX, 20 µg/mL was used, which was sufficient to deplete YSF3 transcript levels in the tetO-YSF3/Δ GRACE strain (S5C Fig) [50]. ACT1 was efficiently spliced in the wild-type control in the absence or presence of DOX, suggesting DOX has no impact on splicing efficiency of the ACT1 transcript (Fig 3C). In the tetO-YSF3/Δ and tetO-PRP19/Δ strains, we observed an accumulation of unspliced ACT1 in the presence of DOX at both 22 and 37 °C, supporting that Ysf3 is important for splicing in C. albicans (Fig 3C). While it has been previously reported that high temperatures reduce splicing efficiency in C. albicans leading to enhanced intron retention (IR) [49], the link between low temperature (temperatures below 30 °C) and splicing efficiency has yet to be investigated. To explore the impact of low temperature on global IR and assess the importance of Ysf3 for global pre-mRNA splicing, we employed 150 bp paired-end RNA-Seq on polyadenylated RNA to map splicing of all intron-containing genes using the tetO-YSF3/Δ GRACE strain and the wild-type control in the presence and absence of 20 µg/mL DOX at both 22 and 37 °C. Principal component analysis of gene expression profiles showed that biological replicates behaved similarly and clustered together (Fig 3D). Furthermore, a significant reduction of YSF3 RNA expression upon DOX treatment led to altered gene expression profiles and the formation of distinct clusters at the two tested temperatures (Fig 3D and S2 Data). Confirming the RT-PCR results (Fig 3C), we detected increased intronic reads for ACT1 when YSF3 was depleted by DOX (S6A Fig). To assess the degree of pre-mRNA splicing globally, we performed a junction-read based analysis to estimate the fraction of IR in all 8 conditions (Fig 3E). This revealed that most introns are well spliced in wild type and the tetO-YSF3/Δ strain in the absence of DOX (median IR fraction for WT: 0.02 (22 °C)/0.04 (37 °C); for tetO-YSF3/Δ without DOX: 0.02 (22 °C)/0.05 (37 °C)) (S3 Data). A modest, but significant increase in IR was seen at 37 °C in wild type and the tetO-YSF3/Δ GRACE strain without DOX, as reported previously (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.0001****, Figs 3E and S6B) [49]. However, depletion of YSF3 at both temperatures increased IR substantially to median IR fractions of 0.43 and 0.39 at 22 °C and 37 °C, respectively (Fig 3E). IR differences upon depletion of YSF3 were similar and well correlated between all intron-containing genes at both temperatures; however, slightly more pronounced at 22 °C than at 37 °C (Fig 3F and S4 Data). According to the function of S. cerevisiae Ysf3 within the SF3b complex, we hypothesized that C. albicans Ysf3 could be involved in recognizing branchpoint sequence (BPS) and influence splicing of introns with diverse cis-regulatory features as the U2 snRNP [45,48]. To assess this, we analyzed the impact of YSF3 depletion on the accumulation of introns with diverse features, such as intron length, BPS to 3′ splice site (SS) distance, SS consensus, polypyrimidine tract length, and composition and intronic GC-content (S6C and S6D Fig and S4 Data). All features could be extracted from the annotated intronic sequence (Methods). To analyze C. albicans BPSs, we scored intronic 7-nt (nucleotide) motifs according to their similarity to the 7-nt BPS found in S. cerevisiae and also reported for C. albicans [51,52]. For most introns, a single motif close to the intron end (3′ SS) was detected, consistent with the evolutionarily conserved distance of BPS and 3′ SS [52]. For introns with multiple high-scoring 7-nt motifs, the motif was chosen that had the closest match to the typically observed distance of 15−74 nts (median 24 nts) to the 3′ SS and the higher score. As reported previously, the consensus BPS is 5′-UACUAAC-3′ and can be found in >80% of introns (S3 Data) [51,52]. Consistent with our hypothesis, IR and IR differences were increased for introns with non-consensus BPSs and for BPSs that are more distal or proximal to the 3′ SS than the typical branchpoint at both temperatures (Figs 3G and S6D). Interestingly, variation in other intronic features, such as intron length, and 5′ SS sequence also correlated with variation in IR difference (Figs 3G and S6C and S6D). This analysis suggests C. albicans Ysf3 is an important splicing factor, including for those introns that are short and/or exhibit nonconsensus cis-regulatory elements. Given the high prevalence of unspliced mRNAs upon YSF3 depletion, the incompletely processed mRNAs could produce incomplete and possibly toxic, truncated or misfolded proteins that could impact growth. Combining mRNA expression and IR estimates for all intron-containing genes passing our minimal read depth cutoffs for splicing and expression quantification, we estimated that the pool of unspliced, adenylated, and possibly translated cytoplasmic mRNAs increased 6-fold (from 4.1% to 23.9% at 22 °C) and 4-fold (from 5.2% to 20.3% at 37 °C) upon YSF3 depletion (Figs 3H and 6E and S5 Data). This could lead to an increase of prematurely terminated translation products that could be cleared by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) or require increased proteasome capacity [53,54]. Although we did not see evidence for increased expression of NMD components, genes associated with proteasomal function were increased in their expression relative to all expressed genes and enriched in the group of upregulated genes (Figs 3I, 3J, and S6F and S6 Data). Among downregulated genes, genes involved in filamentous growth and cellular responses to the environment were enriched, consistent with the previously established link between splicing and filamentation [49] (S6G Fig). Interestingly, depletion of YSF3 significantly reduced filamentation in YPD supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum at 37 °C compared to wild-type controls (S5B and S5C Fig). This phenotype was similar to what was observed upon depletion of EFG1, a transcription factor known to be required for filamentation. Overall, we conclude that CaYsf3 is important for splicing of most intron-containing genes with particular importance for short introns and/or nonconsensus cis-regulatory elements. Uncharacterized Candida clade-specific genes essential for growth can enable discovery of new biology relevant to developing antifungal treatments. Hence, we turned to a Candida clade-specific gene C6_00110C that was identified as important for growth at elevated temperature (cluster 6). As observed by spot dilution assays, transcriptional repression of C6_00110C with DOX abrogated growth only at 40.5 °C (Fig 4A). To confirm the temperature-specific essentiality phenotype, we generated a homozygous deletion mutant of C6_00110C, as well as a complemented strain. When examining the growth phenotype of these mutants, we confirmed that deletion of C6_00110C resulted in little to no growth at temperatures at or above 37 °C (Fig 4B). Thus, we named the gene Required for Heat Tolerance 1 (RHT1). BLASTp analysis, conserved domain searches, and co-expression data [55] failed to predict a function for Rht1 and AlphaFold prediction yielded a structure with low model confidence scores for the majority of the amino acids in the protein sequence (pLDDT < 70) (Fig 4C), leaving the function of this Candida-specific protein elusive. Thus, we turned to our bypass mutant selection strategy to uncover the function of this elusive gene and plated 108 rht1Δ/Δ cells on YPD agar plates and incubated at 42 °C for 5 days. Through this approach, we evolved 10 independent bypass mutants (ByMs) with a restored ability to grow at 42 °C in the absence of RHT1 (Fig 4D). Interestingly, when these ByMs were passaged at 30 °C, colonies with restored high-temperature sensitivity (ByMRs) were readily isolated (S4B Fig). ByMRs were successfully isolated for nine out of the 10 ByMs (Figs 4D and S4B). A) Spotting assay was performed as described in Fig 2A except plates were incubated for 2 days. B) Spotting assay was performed as described in Fig 2A. C6_00110CA/A represents the C6_00110cΔ/Δ strain which was complemented with both A alleles.

When examining the genomic changes of the ByMs, we observed significant chromosomal copy number changes for all ByMs. In particular, we detected trisomy of Chr1, Chr2, Chr4 and Chr5 for ByMs 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9; trisomy of Chr1, Chr2, and Chr4 for ByM3; segmental monosomy of Chr7 and ChrR for ByM4; and trisomy of Chr1 and Chr5 as well as segmental trisomy of Chr2 for ByM5 (Fig 4E). When analyzing chromosome copy numbers for ByMRs including 1R, 2R, 3R, 6R, 7R, 8R, and 9R, all strains shared the concurrent loss of Chr1 and Chr2 trisomies, despite differences in Chr3, Chr4, and Chr7 trisomies (Fig 4E). ByM4R and ByM5R gained segmental and full length Chr7 and ChrR trisomies, respectively (Fig 4E). While aneuploidies were detected for ByM10, variant-calling identified a heterozygous mutation in IML3. Iml3 was recently characterized as a C. albicans kinetochore component and is required for heat tolerance [27]. The identified mutation resulted in a substitution of leucine (L) to serine (S) at the amino acid position 67 (Fig 4F). Substitution of S back to L at position 67 in ByM10 abrogated growth at high temperature, whereas both heterozygous and homozygous substitution of L to S at position 67 in the rht1Δ/Δ background restored growth at 40.5 °C, confirming the mutation in Iml3 was both necessary and sufficient for bypassing high-temperature essentiality in rht1Δ/Δ (Fig 4F). Overall, the ploidy changes and mutation in a kinetochore gene observed in rht1Δ/Δ mutants grown at elevated temperature suggests Rht1 may be involved in chromosome segregation and/or genome stability. Given a potential role for Rht1 in genome stability, we examined whether this gene was important for cell cycle progression. Interestingly, the rht1Δ/Δ strain produced both yeast and filaments under non-filament-inducing conditions with the filaments resembling wild-type cells treated with cell cycle inhibitors hydroxyurea (HU) or nocodazole (NOC), suggesting a defect in cell cycle progression in the absence of RHT1 (Fig 5A). Furthermore in a dose-response assay, deletion of RHT1 resulted in a higher sensitivity to G1/S phase inhibitors HU and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) [56,57] and the G2/M phase inhibitor NOC [58], supporting the potential role of Rht1 in cell cycle progression (Fig 5B). Higher temperature further exacerbated sensitivity of the rht1Δ/Δ mutant to all three drugs (Fig 5B), reinforcing the greater requirement of cell cycle-related genes at high temperature. While the complemented strain fully restored tolerance to all three drugs, ByM1 and ByM10 only partially restored tolerance to HU and MMS (Fig 5B). A) Candida albicans strains were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in YPD and grown at 30 °C for 4 h. Cells treated with 25 mM hydroxyurea (HU) or 50 µM nocodazole (NOC) were used as controls. Scale bar represents 20 µm. B) Dose-response assays were performed with 2-fold titrations of hydroxyurea, nocodazole, and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) at 30 and 35 °C. OD600 was measured after 48 h, values were normalized relative to wild type without drug (see color scale bar).

(BFDR threshold = 0, average spectral counts ≥ 20, fold change relative to Eno1 ≥ 50). Protein-labeled nodes are colored based on protein function annotations.

The data underlying Fig 5B, 5D, and 5E can be found in S1 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003409.g005 Identification of protein interaction partners can provide further insights into gene function. Hence, we performed affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) of a C-terminally GFP-tagged Rht1 strain to define the protein’s interactome using Eno1-GFP as a control for background [25,27]. The homozygous tagged protein was expressed and fully rescued the rht1Δ/Δ high-temperature essentiality phenotype, confirming functionality of Rht1-GFP (S7A and S7B Fig). AP-MS identified 62 high-confidence protein interactors (Bayesian False Discovery Rate [BFDR] = 0, average spectral counts ≥20, and fold change relative to Eno1 ≥50; S7 Data). Consistent with our genetic evidence, the majority of the interactors were found to function in chromatin remodeling, DNA replication and repair, cell cycle progression, transcription, and transcription regulation (Fig 5C). A total of 29 genes encoding Rht1-interacting proteins were included in the secondary fitness screen across six different temperatures. Twelve genes were found in cluster 1 (genes important for fitness across all temperatures) and 15 genes were found in clusters 2 or 6 (genes important for fitness at elevated temperatures), including six genes encoding proteins of the Remodels the Structure of Chromatin (RSC) complex (S7C Fig). Interestingly, five of the six RSC complex members are located on Chr1 or Chr2, chromosomes that increased in copy number upon growth of the rht1 mutant at elevated temperature. The specificity of Rht1 to the Candida clade, its requirement for growth at high temperatures, and its implication in genome stability motivated assessment of its role in virulence and antifungal susceptibility. To determine the role of Rht1 in C. albicans virulence, we turned to the G. mellonella model of C. albicans infection. While injection of the wax moths with the wild-type and complemented strains resulted in profound lethality, the rht1Δ/Δ strain had significantly attenuated virulence only at 39 °C, confirming that Rht1 is required for C. albicans pathogenesis at febrile temperature (Fig 5D). Genome stability modulates fluconazole susceptibility in C. albicans [59], and therefore, we wanted to investigate whether Rht1 was important for azole activity. Dose-response assays with fluconazole showed that loss of Rht1 rendered fluconazole cidal only at 35 °C (Fig 5E). Similarly, when we performed an ETEST strip assay and disc diffusion assay by spotting 50 µg of fluconazole onto a disc placed on a lawn of C. albicans, we confirmed that Rht1 is important for azole activity at 35 °C, as the deletion mutant grew in the absence of fluconazole at 35 °C and showed enhanced clearance around the fluconazole strip or disc relative to wild type (Fig 5F and 5G). The zone of clearance remained after 5 days of incubation at 35 °C (S8A and S8B Fig). Interestingly, growth around the fluconazole disc was restored in ByM10 at 35 °C but not in ByM1 (Fig 5G), suggesting aneuploidy could not fully mask the requirement of Rht1 in fluconazole susceptibility, but the substitution in Iml3 could. Since its original release in 2003, two subsequent expansions of the GRACE library, including the set of 1,235 genes introduced in this study, have increased the total coverage to 4,492 genes [23,25], representing the largest mutant library in C. albicans. Screens of subsets of the GRACE library have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of C. albicans biology and pathogenesis mechanisms including gene essentiality [23,25], fitness in different environmental conditions [27], morphogenesis [22,24,49,60,61], adhesion [62], macrophage interactions [63], and antifungal susceptibility [64,65]. With our expanded GRACE collection, we sought to identify genes required for fitness in diverse temperatures in C. albicans by screening the collection of mutants at both low and high temperatures. Our functional genomic screen identified dozens of genes with important roles in governing C. albicans fitness in a temperature-dependent manner, including GAR1, YSF3, and RHT1. Gar1 plays an important function in pseudouridylation in S. cerevisiae. In C. albicans, deletion of GAR1 caused a severe growth defect across all temperatures tested and completely abrogated growth at 40.5 °C, indicating that GAR1 is important for fungal survival. Interestingly, the nonsynonymous mutation in KRR1 was able to compensate for the fitness defect of the gar1Δ/Δ strain. Krr1 functions in protein and RNA binding via two KH domains for ribosome assembly [66]. The nonsynonymous mutation in the evolved mutant is located in the first KH domain, which lacks the typical GXXG RNA-binding motif [67]. The mutation could either directly or indirectly prime Cbf5 for its catalytic activity in the absence of Gar1. Supporting this hypothesis, Krr1 was shown to physically interact with Cbf5 in multiple studies in S. cerevisiae [38,66,68–70]. In S. cerevisiae, a point mutation in the conserved XLD motif of CBF5 abolishes its pseudouridine synthase activity and eliminates rRNA pseudouridylation, but the mutant remains viable [71]. Thus, whether Gar1 and Krr1 impact temperature-dependent growth via rRNA pseudouridylation in C. albicans remains to be elucidated. Initially thought to be an obligate human commensal fungal pathogen, C. albicans has been found to persist in the environment [72–74], expanding its thermal adaptation range. In this study, we showed that genes in cluster 3 are enriched in RNA metabolic processes and rRNA processes, and they are important for tolerance to temperatures lower than the host temperature of 37 °C. C1_11680C grouped with cluster 3 in the secondary screen, and spot dilution assays confirmed that C1_11680C depletion resulted in no growth at 16 °C and severe growth defects at all other temperatures. Functional characterization of C1_11680C revealed that the gene likely encodes Ysf3, a component of the SF3b complex required for splicing. RNA-sequencing analyses at 22 and 37 °C showed that depletion of YSF3 reduced the efficiency of pre-mRNA splicing, likely increasing the translation of truncated proteins. The effect was slightly stronger at the lower temperature, correlating with a more pronounced growth phenotype at this condition. The high protein structure similarity of C. albicans Ysf3 to S. cerevisiae Ysf3 coupled with the reduced splicing efficiency upon YSF3 depletion suggests that Ysf3 has an important role for splicing in C. albicans. However, future studies are needed to experimentally confirm its function as part of the Sf3b complex and its possible involvement in BP recognition. Among the 30.6% of genes without functional annotation in the GRACEv3 collection is C6_00110C (RHT1), which we identified as a gene required for C. albicans fitness at high temperature. Compared with the gar1Δ/Δ strain, the rht1Δ/Δ strain exhibited an astonishing capacity to evolve bypass mutants, overcoming the fitness defect of the strain at elevated temperatures. Nine out of the 10 bypass mutants were driven by aneuploidy, and seven shared Chr1 and Chr2 trisomies. Interestingly, all seven bypass mutants lost Chr1 and Chr2 trisomies when passaged at a lower temperature, suggesting Chr1 and Chr2 trisomy may contribute to the bypass mechanism. The dynamic ploidy changes observed at different temperatures in rht1Δ/Δ mutants suggest that Rht1 may play a role in maintaining genome stability; however, the temperature-dependent effects of Rht1 on genome stability remain to be elucidated. Among the 62 high-confidence Rht1 interactors, 10 proteins function in the RSC chromatin remodeling complex and 8 are encoded by genes located on Chr1 and Chr2 [75]. It is possible that in rht1Δ/Δ mutants, upregulation of RSC complex genes on Chr1 and Chr2 could enhance chromatin remodeling activities. Supporting this hypothesis, experimental evolution for high temperature survival identified mutations in the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex that enables thermal adaptation in S. cerevisiae [76]. However, additional experiments are warranted to confirm this model. The evolvability of bypass mutants in the rht1 background highlights that C. albicans is able to employ diverse mechanisms in mitigating environmentally contingent detrimental mutations. Such phenomena have also been described in C. albicans when examining the ability of this species to evolve resistance to the azoles [59]. Aneuploidy formation, in particular, isochromosome formation on the left arm of chromosome 5, drives fluconazole resistance [59,77,78]. Chromosome 5 contains ERG11 and TAC1, encoding the fluconazole target and a transcription factor regulating drug efflux pumps [79]. Interestingly, the aneuploidy identified in ByM1 failed to restore azole susceptibility despite the increased copy number of Chr5. In contrast, the evolved mutation in IML3 identified in ByM10 largely restored fungal viability in the presence of fluconazole, suggesting Rht1 likely exerts pleiotropic functions that regulate fitness at elevated temperature and azole exposure. Identification of Rht1 as a novel Candida clade-specific gene required for heat tolerance and virulence highlights the power of functional genomic screens to advance our understanding of C. albicans biology and the importance of continuous expansion efforts to reach whole-genome coverage. Despite our functional characterizations of Rht1, the exact molecular mechanism underlying its role in cell cycle progression and genome stability remains elusive. Interestingly, the functionally relevant kinetochore protein Iml3, implicated by bypass mutant selection, was not present in the Rht1 interactome elucidated by AP-MS. Similarly, close examination of the Iml3 interactome failed to identify Rht1 [27], suggesting a lack of physical interaction between the two proteins. Additional experiments are warranted to pinpoint Rht1’s functional link with the C. albicans kinetochore. Overall, our work characterized genes required for fitness in diverse temperature environments for the major fungal pathogen C. albicans. While connections between temperature and antifungal resistance have been described in the literature [80], more examples continue to be unveiled. In the recently discovered fungal pathogen Rhodsporidiobolus fluvialis, human body temperature elevates mutation rates and drives pan-drug resistance against all three classes of antifungal drugs [81,82]. In Cryptococcus deneoformans, heat stress enhances transposon mobility, which may enable adaptation during infection [83,84]. Thus, it is crucial to continue to probe the mechanisms by which thermal tolerance enables antifungal resistance to disarm fungal threats. Strains used in this study are listed in S1 Table. Plasmids used in this study are listed in S2 Table. Strains were frozen in 25% glycerol at −80 °C for long-term storage. Active cultures were maintained on solid yeast extract peptone (YPD; 1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% glucose, and 2% agar) at 4 °C for no longer than 1 month. Liquid cultures were grown in YPD at 30 °C, unless otherwise indicated. To select for NAT-resistant mutants, NAT (Jena Bioscience, 96736-11-7) was solubilized in water and supplemented into YPD agar plates (150–250 μg/mL). Prototrophic colonies were selected on SD plates (0.674% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids with ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, and 2% agar). Temperature-dependent fitness screens were performed using minimal medium plates (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and without ammonium sulfate, with 2% glucose, 0.1% glutamic acid (MSG), 0.002% histidine, and 2% agar). DOX (Bio Basic, DB0889) stock was prepared at a concentration of 50 mg/mL in H2O, filter-sterilized, and added to the media at the indicated concentration. All genes in the C. albicans genome were analyzed for GO annotations by biological functions on CGD website [28]. Genes with GO terms assigned with codes IC (inferred by curator), IDA (inferred by direct assay), IEP (inferred from expression pattern), IGI (inferred from genetic interaction) in C. albicans, IMP (inferred from mutant phenotype), IPI (inferred from physical interaction), and TAS (traceable author statement) were categorized in the “experimentally characterized” group. Genes with GO terms assigned based on evidence in S. cerevisiae with codes IEA (inferred from electronic annotation), IGI, ISA (inferred from sequence alignment), ISM (inferred from sequence model), ISO (inferred from sequence orthology), and ISS (inferred from sequence or structural similarity) were categorized in the “putative based on S. cerevisiae ortholog” group. Genes with GO terms assigned based on evidence in S. pombe with code IEA were categorized in the ‘putative based on S. pombe ortholog’ group. Genes with GO terms assigned based on evidence in other fungal species with codes IEA, ISA, ISO, and ISS were categorized in the ‘putative based on other fungal species’ group. Genes with GO terms assigned based on conserved protein domains with codes IEA were categorized in the “putative based on conserved protein domains” group. Genes with GO terms assigned codes ISA based on nonfungal species, ISM, and NAS (nontraceable author statement) were categorized in the ‘other’ group. Genes with no GO terms assigned were categorized in the “no data available” group. Double-barcoded HET mutants that were not present in the original collection were constructed, as described previously [25]. Briefly, the CaHIS3 cassette was PCR amplified from pLC1251 using primer 5 and primer 6, each containing 43 base pairs of homology to the 5′ or 3′ of the target gene, internal unique 20 base pair strain-identifying barcodes with flanking common sequences, and 18 base pairs that anneal to the 5′ or 3′ of the CaHIS3 cassette. The cassette was transformed into the histidine auxotrophic parental strain, CaLC6106, that contains the tetracycline-repressible transactivator.

C. albicans GRACE strains in the GRACEv3 library were screened for growth at 30 °C, as previously described [25]. Briefly, GRACE strains were pinned into 96-well plates (Sarstedt) containing liquid YPD medium and grown overnight at 30 °C. The next day, cells were transferred into liquid YPD medium in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX in technical duplicates and grown at 30 °C overnight. Approximately 2 μL of cultures were then transferred onto minimal media agar plates in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX using a metal replicator and grown for 2 days 30 °C. The plates were imaged on a ChemiDoc, and growth fitness was scored independently by two people, using the scoring system outlined in Fig 1C. The entire GRACE library was screened for growth fitness at 39 °C following the same screening pipeline except that cells were grown on minimal media agar plates in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX at 39 °C (S1B Fig). C. albicans GRACE strains with a fitness score above 1 in the presence of DOX from the growth screens at 30 and 39 °C were prioritized for a secondary screen at six temperatures (S1D Fig). 947 strains were arrayed and pinned into 96-well plates (Sarstedt) containing liquid minimal medium in the absence and presence of 0.5 µg/mL DOX and grown overnight at 30 °C. The next day, 5 µL of mixed cells were diluted in 95 µL H2O and then 5 µL diluted cells were inoculated onto minimal media agar plates in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX using a multi-channel pipettor and grown for 10 days at 16 °C, 4 days at 22 °C, 2 days at 30 °C, 2 days at 37 °C, 3 days at 39 °C, and 4 days at 40.5 °C. The plates were imaged on a ChemiDoc, and growth was scored independently by three people, using the scoring system outlined in Fig 1C. Four biological replicates were performed for growth screens at 16 and 22 °C, and three biological replicates were performed for growth screens at 30, 37, 39, and 40.5 °C. Genes represented by the 947 strains screened at the six distinct temperatures were clustered based on fitness scores in six temperatures by Euclidean distance (k = 6). GO enrichment analysis was performed using CGD for genes in each cluster against the background of 947 genes screened. P-value was adjusted by false discovery rate (FDR), and only terms with p-adjusted values greater than 0.05 were plotted. Count represents the total number of genes assigned to a given GO term. Blast analyses were performed for C1_11680C and C6_00110C DNA and protein sequences using NCBI (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) [89], FungiDB (https://fungidb.org/fungidb/app/workspace/blast/new) [90], and SGD (https://www.yeastgenome.org/blast-sgd) [91] blast tools. AlphaFold [46] predicted structures were obtained from UniProt31 Website (https://www.uniprot.org/). Similarity between pairs of protein structures was assessed through TM-Align (https://zhanggroup.org/TM-align/) [47]. Wild-type and GRACE strains were grown in YPD in the absence and presence of 0.05 µg/mL DOX overnight at 30 °C. Aliquots of each overnight culture (1 mL) were washed once in H2O and diluted to an OD600 of 0.8. Cells were 10-fold serially diluted four times in H2O in a 96-well plate and 3 µL of cells from each dilution were spotted on YPD agar in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX. Cells from YPD overnight were spotted on YPD agar and cells from YPD supplemented with 0.05 µg/mL DOX overnight were spotted on YPD agar supplemented with 100 µg/mL DOX. YPD agar plates for box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex and SF3b complex GRACE strains were grown for 5 days at 30 °C. YPD agar plates for the tetO-RHT1/Δ GRACE strain were grown for 2 days at 30 °C. Spot dilution assays were performed the same way for wild type, deletion mutant, complemented strains, and bypass mutants without DOX. To evolve bypass mutants, single colonies were cultured in 3 mL YPD under shaking conditions at 30 °C for 48 h and 24 h for CaLC10712 and CaLC10720, respectively. Cells were washed once in H2O and 108 cells were plated on YPD agar media and incubated at 42 °C for 2 weeks and 5 days, respectively. Colonies were propagated on YPD agar and grown at 30 °C to isolate single colonies. A single colony was used to validate bypass phenotype, isolate genomic DNA extraction, and archive in 25% glycerol for −80 °C storage. For rht1Δ/Δ bypass mutants, lineages with restored high temperature sensitivity were obtained from the YPD agar plate during isolation for single colonies (S4 Fig). To confirm DOX-dependent transcriptional repression, wild-type and GRACE strains were grown in YPD in the absence and presence of 0.05 µg/mL DOX overnight at 30 °C, shaking. The next day, the cultures were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in 10 mL YPD in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX and grown for 4 h at 30 °C. GRACE mutants for essential genes were sub-cultured to an OD600 between 0.3 and 0.4 in 10 mL YPD in the presence of 100 µg/mL DOX for 4 h at 30 °C. To confirm DOX-dependent transcriptional repression for YSF3 and EFG1 GRACE strains used in the filamentation assay, cells were grown as above except on the second day, cells were sub-cultured in YPD in the absence and presence of 20 µg/mL DOX. For ITS1 and ITS2 quantification, overnight cultures of wild-type, gar1Δ/Δ, GAR1A/A, and gar1Δ/Δ ByM1 strains were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in 10 mL YPD and grown for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted, washed once with cold H2O, flash frozen, and stored at −80°C. Cells were lysed by bead beating four times for 30 s, with one minute on ice between. RNA was extracted using the QIAGEN Rneasy kit and Dnase-treated using the Invitrogen DNA-free DNA removal kit. cDNA synthesis was performed using the iScript cDNA synthesis Kit (Biorad). Standard curve was performed for each pair of primers using wild-type samples to determine the optimal cDNA dilutions for qRT-PCR. cDNAs were diluted 80-fold for expression analysis and 800-fold for ITS1 and ITS2 level quantification. qRT-PCR was performed in technical triplicate with a 10 µL reaction volume in a 384-well plate, using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the BioRad CFX-384 Real Time System. The following cycling conditions were used: 95 °C for 3 min, then 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 30 s, for 40 cycles. The melt curve was completed with the following cycle conditions: 95 °C for 10 s and 65 °C for 10 s with an increase of 0.5 °C per cycle up to 95 °C. The primers used to monitor expression are listed in S8 Data. The fluorescent translation assay was performed with the Click-iT HPG Alexa Fluor 488 Protein Synthesis Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher C10428), as previously described [37]. Overnights of SC5314, CaLC10712, and CaLC10713 were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 into 5 mL synthetic defined (SD) medium without amino acids, without ammonium sulfate supplemented with 2% glucose, monosodium glutamate, and uridine and grown at 30 °C, shaking, for 4 h. For positive and negative controls, 1 mL aliquots of SC5314 cells were spun down, and the pellet was resuspended in SD with 100 µM anisomycin or 4 µg/mL fluconazole, and the cultures were incubated under shaking conditions at 30 °C for 10 min. One milliliter aliquots of each sample and drug-treated SC5314 cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 mL of SD with l-HPG at 1:1,000 dilution. SC5314 cells resuspended in SD without HPG were used as the no-HPG control. All samples were incubated at 30 °C, shaking, for 30 min. Cells were spun down, supernatant removed, and pellets washed once with 1× PBS before being resuspended in 500 µL PBS. Cells were fixed by adding 500 µL 70% ethanol in 1× PBS and rocking for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then pelleted and washed twice with 3% BSA in PBS. Pellets were resuspended with 500 µL of the reaction cocktail containing the azide fluorophore (prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol) and incubated for 30 min, shaking in the dark. The samples were washed once with the rinse buffer, pelleted, and resuspended in 20 µL of 1× PBS. Cells were imaged by differential interference contrast microscopy and the EGFP channel on a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 at the same exposure time and analyzed using a CytoFlex flow cytometer (Backman Coulter) to quantify fluorescence intensity. A total of 20,000 events were documented and median fluorescein isothiocyanate value was determined using the CytExpert software. Drug susceptibility was measured using a modified broth microdilution protocol in 96-well plates (Sarstedt) format, as previously described [92]. Drugs fluconazole, HU, NOC, and MMS were tested in liquid YPD. Cultures were grown in 2-fold dilutions of drug for 48 h as indicated. To assess cidality, 5 µL of mixed cultures were pipetted onto YPD agar following OD600 measurements, and the agar plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. Data were displayed quantitatively as heat maps using Java TreeView software (version 1.1.6r4). Reported results are representative of two independent experiments, each performed in technical duplicate. Genomic DNA was isolated using the phenol-chloroform extraction method as previously described [78]. Libraries were prepared using NEB Ultra II FS DNA Kit and sequenced with Illumina Novaseq X Plus PE150bp to obtain 50–1,000× coverage. Sequencing data were processed as previously described, with minor modifications [77,93]. For genomes with 1,000× coverage, quality control and trimming were performed using fastp (v0.23.4) [94] with minimum qualified phred quality of 20, a 40% limit on unqualified bases, a mean quality requirement of 20, a cut window size of 5, both front and tail cutting, and with correction enabled. For genomes with 50–100× coverage, adaptor sequences and low-quality reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (v0.39 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36 TORPHRED33) [95]. Trimmed reads were aligned to the C. albicans reference genome (SC5314_version_A21-s02-m09-r10) [28] using BWA-MEM (v.0.7.17) [96] with default parameters. Aligned reads were sorted, duplicate reads were marked, and the resulting BAM file was indexed with Samtools (v.1.17) [97] and picard (RRID:SCR_006525, v.2.26.3). The quality of trimmed FASTQ and BAM files was assessed with FastQC (v.0.12.1) [98] and Qualimap (v.2.2.1) [99]. Chromosome copy number changes were visualized using the Yeast Mapping Analysis Pipeline (YMAP v.1.0) [100]. Aligned BAM files were uploaded to YMAP and mapped to the reference genome C. albicans SC5314 (A21-S02-m09-r10) with GC-content bias correction for read-depth. Read depth along the x axis indicating chromosome position (Chr1–ChrR) was plotted as the log2 ration that was converted to 0–4 as the y axis indicating chromosome copy number [100]. Haplotypes are color-coded with gray, magenta, and cyan indicating heterozygous AB, homozygous B, and homozygous A, respectively. Variant calling and filtering were performed for bypass mutants that failed to revert with Mutect2 and FilterMutectCalls within the GATK package (v.4.6.1.0) [101]. Pairwise variant calling was run for each bypass mutant and its parental strain with the bypass mutant as “tumor” and the parental strain as “normal” using the reference genome C. albicans SC5314 (A21-S02-m09-r10). The resulting VCF files were further filtered using bcftools (v.1.21) [97]. Specifically, the parental strain was removed from the VCF file and variant calls were filtered for a quality status of “PASS“ and exclusion of calls in repeat regions as marked in (SC5314 v.A21-s02-m09-r10_features.gff) and 5,000 bp subtelomeric regions. Hard filtering was performed with the following parameters: minimum of 5 supporting reads, at least one supporting read in both forward and reverse direction, minimum alternate allele frequency of 0.2. Identified variants were compared among bypass mutants and only unique calls were kept. Variants were annotated with SnpEff (v.4.3t; database built from SC5314 v.A21-s02-m09-r10, with alternate yeast nuclear codon table) [102], formatted using bcftools [97], and verified in IGV [103,104]. Verified variants were compiled into S3 Table. A Galleria mellonella larvae model of infection was performed to test C. albicans temperature-dependent virulence as previously described [27]. Briefly, wild type (SC5314), deletion mutants, and complemented strains were grown overnight shaking in YPD at 30 °C. Cells were counted using a hemocytometer to prepare inoculum of 1 × 108 cells per mL. Trypan blue was added to all inoculum stocks to a final concentration of 0.04% as a visual indicator of proper injection in the larvae. Larvae were screened using a weight filter of 230–300 mg and lack of dark spots indicative of injury and visible signs of pupation. Twenty larvae per group were injected in the last left proleg with 1 × 106 cells in a 10 μL volume using a 500 μL gas-tight 1750 series syringe (Hamilton, Ref: CAL81230) with the PB600 repeating syringe dispenser attachment (Hamilton, 83700) for each strain. A group injected with PBS without cells were used as control. Larvae were incubated in petri dishes by treatment group at indicated temperatures and monitored for 144 h for mortality as defined by lack of response to physical touch. Mortality was first checked at 12 h postinfection, then every 4 h between 12 and 24 h postinfection, every 6 h between 24 and 60 h postinfection, and finally every 12 h thereafter until the endpoint of 144 h. Larvae and pupae were euthanized by freezing at −20 °C. Overnight cultures of wild-type, tetO-YSF3/Δ, and tetO-PRP19/Δ strains in YPD in the absence and presence of 0.05 µg/mL DOX were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 and 0.4 in 10 mL YPD in the absence and presence of 20 µg/mL DOX and grown for approximately 3 h at 22 or 37 °C. RNA was extracted, Dnase-treated, and reverse transcribed as described above with the iScript cDNA synthesis Kit (Biorad), which uses a blend of oligo (dT) and random primers to avoid 5′ and 3′ bias. ACT1 splicing assay was performed as previously described [49]. Briefly, 1 µL of cDNA product was mixed with 0.1 μL of each ACT1 primer at 100 μM (oLC9781 and oLC10309), 2.5 μL of the supplied 10× reaction buffer, 2 μL of the supplied 2.5 mM dNTP mix, 0.25 μL of TAKARA ExTaq DNA polymerase, and 19 μL of ddH2O and subjected to a 30-cycle PCR reaction of 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel at 100 V for 60 min, and the SYBR Safe-stained gels were imaged on a ChemiDoc. Illumina Stranded mRNA Ligation Kit was used to prepare libraries for wild-type and tetO-YSF3/Δ RNAs. Libraries were sequenced with Illumina Novaseq X Plus PE150bp to obtain >50 million reads per sample. Following quality control by FastQC/0.11.9 [98] using the following command: fastqc -o QC_$OUTNAME $R1 $R2 # “$OUTNAME”_R1t.fastq.gz “$OUTNAME”_R2t.fastq.gz, detected Nextera adapter sequences were trimmed off of the paired-end 150 bp reads using cutadapt/2.10 [105] with the following flags and settings: --cores=0 -b CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT -B CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT -e 0.1 -O 10 -m 16 –output=”$OUTNAME”_R1t.fastq.gz –paired-output= ”$OUTNAME”_R2t.fastq.gz $R1 $R2. Another FastQC quality control was performed after trimming. HISAT2/2.2.1 [106] was used to map the trimmed reads to the Candida albicans SC5314 genome version A22 with the following specifications: hisat2 –summary-file “$OUTNAME”_A22_summary.txt –max-intronlen 2000 -x $GENOME2 –rna-strandness FR -1 $R1 -2 $R2 -S “$OUTNAME”_A22.sam –novel-splicesite-outfile “$OUTNAME”_novelSS.txt. Unmapped reads were removed, and the generated output of the mapped reads was converted into tdf and bedgraph files using SAMtools/1.16/1 [107], BEDtools/2.30.0 [108] and IGVtools [104] for IGV visualization and further analyses. Read counts per gene for differential gene expression analysis were obtained using a custom bash script involving SAMtools/1.9, BEDTools/2.27.1 and a custom R script, as described in Lash and colleagues [49]. Specifically, the resulting bam files from mapping were split into first and second reads with SAMtools view -h -b -f 0x40 $BAM > r1.bam/ 0x80 $BAM > r2.bam. Following intersection with the genome annotation by bedtools intersect, reads overlapping with annotated features were counted using awk and bash commands. Resulting files contained reads per gene, as well as total mapped reads (including intergenic regions). Differential gene expression analysis was performed with custom R scripts using the DESeq2 package [109] from Bioconductor. DESeqDataSetFromMatrix was used to create the DESeqDataSet object to run DeSeq, comparing every condition with each other (S2 Data). Principal component analysis was performed by using vst and plotPCA functions. To create custom colors and shapes based on condition, ggplot2 [110] was used for better visualization of the PCA plot. For the analysis towards Figs 3H and S6E, intron-containing gene expression values were adjusted to consider exclusively the CDS for gene expression and excluding reads covering introns that are expected to differ strongly in counts due to decreased pre-mRNA splicing upon YSF3 depletion. First, the reads per intron were calculated using the same approach as for obtaining reads per gene, except for using the intron annotation for bedtools intersect. The obtained intron counts, as well as the total gene counts were normalized for library size by dividing by the number of total mapped reads for each sample. Following normalization, the average counts were calculated between replicates of the same condition. Next, the normalized, averaged number of reads per intron was subtracted from the number of reads per (intron-containing) gene to obtain ‘reads per exon’, to get a measure for expression of transcripts that could actually be subject to translation. Combined exon length was calculated by subtracting the intron length from gene length. Then, reads per kilobase (RPK) values were calculated by dividing number of reads per exon by the exon length in kilobases. To obtain spliced and unspliced intron-containing gene expression, RPK values were multiplied by the respective IR fraction for that gene and condition (S5 Data). Genes with multiple introns were excluded from this analysis. For splicing and IR quantification, the intron annotation used contained annotated introns from CGD, including 5′UTR introns. Analysis was carried out as in Lash and colleagues [49] using custom bash and R scripts. Specifically, bam files were split into forward and reverse reads again using samtools view -h -b -f 0x40 $BAM > r1.bam/0x80 $BAM > r2.bam. Afterwards, reads were overlapped with the annotated introns maintaining strand information using bedtools intersect. A minimum overlap of three bases was required to consider a read overlapping. The block count shows the number of continuous aligned segments in a read. Reads with a block count of 1, indicating alignment without gaps, were considered unspliced and were further categorized into intronic or unspliced, depending on the start and end position of the read; If the block count is > 1, indicating a gap in the aligned read and thus an exon-exon junction, it was classified as spliced. Split reads were further divided into spliced (exactly matching annotated intron) or alternatively spliced (no perfect match). For each intron, reads for each of the categories were counted. For each intron, IR fraction was calculated by dividing the number of unspliced reads by the sum of the number of unspliced and 2 × the number of spliced reads (S3 and S4 Data). We introduced factor 2 for “spliced” junction reads to account for the aspect that one unspliced transcript can give rise to two “unspliced” reads, but a spliced transcript can only yield one “spliced” read. A minimal read cutoff of 20 was required for further analysis. IR difference was calculated as the difference between the fraction of IR of each induced (+ DOX) and uninduced (− DOX) sample. To computationally identify likely BPSs in C. albicans introns we made use of previously annotated 7-nt branchpoint motifs in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans [52,111]. First, we calculated the frequency, position weight, and logOdds matrix from the frequency of nucleotides at each position within the 7-nt motif and the average nucleotide frequency across S. cerevisiae introns using a custom R script and the Biostrings package. Using the S. cerevisiae LogOdds matrix we calculated a branchpoint score for each 7-nt running window across C. albicans introns by summing up LogOdds matrix entries at the respective motif position (column) and base identity (row). To select likely BPSs we required a score above 4. Three introns did not have a score above 4, filtering for a score greater than 0 yielded a likely branchpoint for all three introns. Overall, 333 introns showed the consensus BPS of 5′ UACUAAC 3′ and 76 introns showed slight variations of that motif (non-consensus BPSs) (S3 Data). Seventy-nine introns had more than one possible branchpoint, whereas we considered the BPSs matching the median distance between BPS and 3′ SS best as the primary branchpoint for our analysis. The median distance between BPS and 3′ SS is 24 nts and matches previous estimates [51]; the distance includes the 7-nt BPS. Introns were categorized by their BP motif (consensus/non-consensus) and into four ranges of BPS to 3′ SS distance using quantile to ensure equal distribution of the data. Intron lengths were obtained through the start and end intron coordinates. As intron lengths underlie a bimodal distribution (S6C Fig), we determined a cutoff between short and long introns by analyzing the distribution of intron lengths in our dataset using kernel density estimation (density() function in R). The density plot revealed two prominent peaks, corresponding to two major intron length modes. We used the findpeaks() function (pracma package) to identify these peaks and then determined the local minimum (valley) in the density curve between them. This valley was used as a threshold to classify introns into “short” (≤valley position) and “long” (>valley position). The first 6 nucleotides of an intron were considered for the 5′SS analysis and the last 3 intronic nucleotides to call 3′SS sequences. The conserved 5′SS motif consists of the sequence GUAUGU (GTATGT in the DNA sequ“nce),”and we defined the 3′SS consensus as the most conserved TAG motif, while also including CAG and AAG, which are common 3′SSs in C. albicans as well [51]. We found that all introns for which we measured IR by RNA-seq had a consensus 3′SS, with TAG being the most abundant comprising 298 introns (73%), AAG was found in 58 introns (14%) and 50 introns had a CAG 3′SS (12%). There was some variation within the 5′ SS, while most of them (336 introns) had the full consensus sequence, which is almost 83%, and 62 introns had only the strongly conserved first three nucleotides GTA of the motif, which in combination makes up almost all introns (398/98%). Thus, we categorized the SSs into consensus or variable 5′ SS (S4 Data). When plotting the Δ IR fraction (IR difference) for the categories intron length, BP motif, SS motif and BP–3′SS distance, we verified that the observed effects are consistent when all other variables are kept constant (optimal motifs/distance). Similar analysis for GC-content, polypyrimidine tract length and CU-fraction within the polypyrimidine tract did not produce significant differences in IR upon Ysf3 depletion. As in Lash and colleagues [49] GO term enrichment was performed using the combined GO annotations from CGD (https://geneontology.org/, version from 08/10/2023, gaf-version: 2; and version from 17/01/2024, gaf-version: 2.2) and GO annotations from S. cerevisiae orthologs (https://geneontology.org/, version from 18/01/2024, gaf-version: 2.2). S. cerevisiae orthologous genes were matched according to the information on CGD. GO term annotations were extended to all parents of individual GO terms using the “get_parent_nodes” function from the GOfuncR package. Occurrences of GO terms were counted in each gene group of interest (up- or down-regulated genes upon YSF3 depletion at 22 or 37 °C, respectively) and compared to their frequency in the gene background. For GO term enrichment among groups of differentially expressed genes we distinguished between upregulated genes (log2-fold change of differential expression > 0.5 and adjusted P-value < 0.00001, 592 genes at 22 °C and 239 genes at 37 °C) and downregulated genes (log2-fold change of differential expression >0.5 and adjusted P-value <0.00001, 616 genes at 22 °C and 342 genes at 37 °C). In this case, the gene background was formed by all genes that were quantified as expressed in the RNA-seq data. To assess the significance of GO term enrichment, we performed the Fisher’s Exact Test and multiple testing correction (Bonferroni correction). A P-value cutoff of <0.01 was used to call positively enriched GO terms for “Biological Process.” Enriched GO terms for “Biological Process,” “Molecular Function,” and “Cellular Component” across up- and down-regulated genes are listed in S6 Data. To determine the impact of YSF3 on morphogenesis, CaSS1, YSF3, and EFG1 GRACE strains were grown in YPD in the presence and absence of 0.05 µg/mL DOX overnight at 30 °C, shaking, and sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in YPD supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum in the presence and absence of 20 µg/mL DOX at 37 °C, shaking, for 6 h. Cells were then imaged on a Zeiss Axio Imager MI. To determine the impact of RHT1 on morphogenesis, overnight cultures of SC5314, CaLC10720, and CaLC10721 were grown in YPD at 30 °C, shaking, and sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in YPD. SC5314 cells treated with 25 mM HU and 50 µM NOC were used as controls. Cultures were grown at 30 °C for 4 h before imaging on a Zeiss Axio Imager MI. Immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged Rht1 was performed to assess RHT1-GFP expression, as previously described [112]. Briefly, overnight cultures were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in 50 mL YPD and grown for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted and washed in 1 mL of F300 buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.2, 300 mM KOAc, and 10% glycerol) and stored at −80 °C. To prepare whole cell lysate, each pellet was resuspended in 1 mL F300 and disrupted by bead-beating (2 min on; 1 min rest on ice) for three cycles. Crude lysates were mixed with a half-volume of F300 supplemented with 0.06% IGPAL-CA630 and sonicated (20 s × 4) at 30% amplitude using a 3-mm diameter probe. Sonicated lysates were treated with ~30 U Benzonase (Millipore) for 20 min after the addition of MgCl2 to the final centration of 2 mM and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C. Total protein (~6 mg) in supernatant was incubated with 20 µL of anti-GFP magnetic beads (GTMA-20; Chromotek) for 90 min on a revolving rotator. Bead-bound proteins were captured using a magnetic rack and washed with F300 + 0.02% IGEPAL-CA630 × 3 before boiling in 30 µL 1 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer. All eluted proteins were resolved on 10% precast SDS-gels and blots probed with HRP-conjugated anti-GFP antibody (118144600012; Roche; 1:3,000) followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (170-65169; Bio-Rad; 1:5,000). All F300 buffers were supplemented immediately prior to use with 1× PhosSTOP (Roche) and 1× Complete inhibitor cocktails (Roche) to inhibit phosphatase and proteinase activity. AP-MS experiments were performed as previously described [27]. Briefly, Rht1-GFP (CaLC10748) and Eno1-GFP (CaLC4449) strains were grown overnight at 30 °C in YPD. Stationary phase cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 in 1 L YPD and grown to an OD600 between 0.6 and 0.8. Cells were harvested at 3,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold water, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen bath. For protein extraction, samples were diluted 1:1 by weight in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA, 5mM DTT, 0.1% NP-40, 1× ROCHE protease inhibitor cocktail tablet [Roche Diagnostics, Mississauga, ON, Canada]) and vortexed with glass beads (0.5 mm) for 4 × 1 min. Lysates were collected by stacked transfer for 5 min at 100g with a 18-gauge needle and clarified by centrifugation at 16,110g for 20 min in 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. To affinity purify the GFP-interacting proteins, we used 25 µL of GFP-TRAP_M magnetic beads (ChromoTek, Martinsried, Germany) for each 1 L culture. Beads were equilibrated three times with 1 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% NP-40, 1× ROCHE protease inhibitors [Roche Diagnostics, Mississauga, ON, Canada]). The protein extract was then added to the resin and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were magnetized then washed with 1 mL of lysis buffer and then 1 mL of wash buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 2 mM CaCl2). The dried beads were resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, and incubated with 0.5 μg trypsin (Sigma, T7575) with rotation at 37 °C overnight (~15 h). The samples were digested on-bead with 0.75 μg trypsin (0.2 μg/μL in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) at 37 °C overnight with rotation. Magnetization and digestion were repeated once more with a shorter incubation of 3–4 h without rotation. Formic acid was added to a final concentration of 2% and stored at −40 °C until used for MS. AP-MS samples and controls were analyzed by MS in two biological replicates. 1/16th of each sample was acquired in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) via LC–MS/MS. Samples were loaded onto Evotip Pure cartridges and eluted from the Performance EV1109 column (8 cm × 150 µm with 1.5 µm beads), heated at 40 °C, with the 60SPD gradient on an Evosep One. The column was coupled to the timsTOF Pro 2 using a 20 µm diameter emitter tip (Bruker 1811107). Peptides were eluted from the column with an acetonitrile gradient generated by an Eksigent ekspert nanoLC 425 and analyzed on a TripleTOF 6600 instrument (AB SCIEX, Concord, Ontario, Canada). The total DDA protocol is 22 min. The MS1 scan had a mass range of 100–1,700 Da in PASEF mode. TIMS settings were accumulation and ramp time of 100 ms (with 4 PASEF ramps and active exclusion at 0.4 min), and within the mobility range (1/K0) of 0.85–1.3 V·s/cm2. This was at a cycle time of 0.53 s. The target intensity was set to 17,500 and the intensity threshold set to 1,750. 1+ ions are excluded from fragmentation using a polygonal filter. The auto calibration was off. MS data generated were stored, searched, and analyzed using the ProHits laboratory information management system (LIMS) platform and searched using MSFragger v4.1 [113] against the C. albicans UniProt database (UP000000559) acquired from NCBI, supplemented with common contaminants, decoy entries were added. Acetylated protein N-term and oxidated methionine were set as variable modifications. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm on either side. Fragment mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm. Enzymatic cleavage was set to trypsin with 2 missed cleavages. MSBooster and Percolator were turned on. Percolator required a minimum probability of 0.5 and did not remove redundant peptides. The target-decoy competition method was used to assign q-values and PEPs. For ProteinProphet, the maximum peptide mass difference was set to 30 ppm. When generating the final report, the protein FDR filter was set to 0.01. FDR was estimated by using both filtered PSM and protein lists. Razor peptides were used for protein FDR scoring. All other parameters were default. Results were analyzed with SAINTexpress (v3.3) [114] with Eno1-GFP samples as negative controls. A total spectral count greater than or equal to 20 and a BFDR value equal to 0 were required for proteins to be classified as significant interaction partners (S7 Data).

Cytoscape [115] was used to visualize high-confidence protein interactors identified by AP-MS. E-test strip assay and disc diffusion assays were performed to test fluconazole tolerance for C. albicans strains, as previously described [116]. Wild type, rht1Δ/Δ mutant, complemented strain, ByM1, ByM1R, and ByM10s were grown in liquid YPD at 30 °C overnight, washed once with sterile H2O, and diluted to a cell density of 108 cells/mL. About 100 µL cells were spread on YPD agar using a sterile cotton swab. Fluconazole E-test strip (bioMérieux) or a 0.5 cm precut filter disc was placed at the center of the YPD agar plates. A volume of 5 µL of 10 mg/mL fluconazole stock was spotted on the filter disc. Plates were incubated upside down at 30 or 35 °C and imaged on a ChemiDoc after 3 days.

Full Content:
ByBoaz Sobrado, Contributor. Howard Lindzon, co-founder and CEO of StockTwits, created an index in May 2023 that tracks companies enabling gambling, day trading, and memecoin speculation. It has returned 130% since inception. The index includes the cornerstone of the speculative economy. It holds Nvidia, Apple, Robinhood, Coinbase, DraftKings, and Bitcoin. These are the infrastructure providers for what Lindzon calls the Degenerate Economy, where investing has converged with entertainment and the lines between trading and gambling have collapsed entirely. Traditional investors find themselves in an uncomfortable position. While retail trading is generally considered to be uninformed, it effectively drives the market. Traditional investors can dismiss what retail traders are doing, or they can acknowledge that Howard Lindzon’s index has doubled the returns of conventional benchmarks while holding household names alongside controversial platforms. The performance gap demands explanation beyond simply calling market participants degenerates. Lindzon built the Degenerate Economy Index around 13 public companies plus Bitcoin. The portfolio divides into clear categories that reveal how speculation became infrastructure. The technology backbone includes Nvidia, Apple, Google, and Meta. These companies provide the computing power, mobile devices, cloud services, and social networks that enable 24/7 access to markets. Without smartphones and social media, retail speculation remains constrained to trading hours and requires desktop computers. The trading platforms include Robinhood, Coinbase, and Interactive Brokers. Commission-free trading, mobile-first design, and cryptocurrency access democratized speculation in ways that traditional brokerages never attempted. Robinhood alone has 24 million funded accounts, most under age 35. The derivatives infrastructure includes CME Group and CBOE. These exchanges provide the futures, options, and volatility products that professional and retail traders use for leveraged speculation. The existence of 3x leveraged ETFs and weekly options expiries reflects demand for higher-risk instruments. DraftKings represents the sports betting category. The company went public in 2020 and now operates in 25 states with 5 million monthly active users. Sports betting legalization following the 2018 PASPA Supreme Court decision created an entirely new category of speculation accessible from phones. Bitcoin itself holds a position in the index. Not as currency or store of value, but as the original digital speculation vehicle that introduced millions to 24/7 trading and extreme volatility as entertainment. The index has seen only about 10 changes since inception. This represents high conviction in the infrastructure thesis rather than trading around momentum. Lindzon is not betting on which memecoin wins or which sports betting platform dominates. He is betting that the infrastructure enabling speculation continues growing regardless of individual winners and losers. The 130% return over 18 months occurred during a period of significant market uncertainty. Interest rates rose from near zero to 5.5%. Regional banks collapsed. Commercial real estate faced existential questions. Geopolitical tensions escalated. None of this mattered to the Degenerate Economy Index. Robinhood stock increased from $8 in May 2023 to over $40 by January 2025. It currently trades at $130. Coinbase moved from $50 to $330 over the same period. Nvidia returned over many multiples as AI demand for GPUs accelerated. DraftKings doubled despite increasing competition in sports betting. The performance occurred because the infrastructure providers collect their rake regardless of whether individual speculators win or lose. Robinhood earns revenue from payment for order flow, margin interest, and premium subscriptions. Coinbase charges transaction fees on every trade. Nvidia sells chips whether they mine Bitcoin or train AI models. CME Group collects fees on every futures contract regardless of who profits. This represents the fundamental insight behind the index construction. Lindzon invested in the arms dealers, not the soldiers. The casinos, not the gamblers. The platforms, not the users. More conservative market participants may argue that this rewards the casino-ification of markets. They point to Robinhood's gamification features, Coinbase's promotion of questionable tokens, and DraftKings' advertising targeting young males with gambling problems. These criticisms are accurate. They are also irrelevant to whether the companies generate profits and grow user bases. Three technological convergences enable the Degenerate Economy and show no signs of reversing. Mobile platforms provide the foundation. The iPhone launched in 2007 and Android followed shortly after. By 2023, global smartphone penetration exceeded 6.8 billion users. These devices enable what Lindzon calls "living life with a wallet on your phone" where stocks, crypto, sports bets, and NFTs sit accessible with a few taps. The friction of desktop trading and phone calls to brokers disappeared. Social networks provide the distribution mechanism. StockTwits, which Lindzon founded in 2008, now has 6 million users discussing markets in real time. Twitter financial content reaches hundreds of millions. Reddit's WallStreetBets has 15 million members. Discord servers coordinate trading activity. Information that previously required expensive Bloomberg terminals or Wall Street Journal subscriptions now spreads instantly and free across social platforms. Blockchain and cryptocurrency provide the rails for 24/7 global trading. Markets that previously closed at 4pm EST now operate continuously. Weekends on StockTwits trend with memecoin tickers rather than traditional stocks. Coinbase reported that approximately 1 million tokens per week are being created as of January 2025. The barriers to launching speculative instruments have collapsed to near zero. The economic context makes these technologies particularly potent. Housing affordability in the US reached its worst level in decades. Student debt exceeds $1.7 trillion. Wage growth lags asset price appreciation. For younger cohorts priced out of traditional wealth building through homeownership and stable employment, high-risk speculation represents a rational response rather than irrational exuberance. Commentators have coined the term "financial nihilism" to describe this phenomenon. When you have nothing to lose, perceived risk changes dramatically. A 23-year-old with no realistic path to buying a house may reasonably conclude that risking $5,000 on memecoins or sports betting parlays offers better expected value than saving for a down payment that never arrives. Sports betting provides the clearest quantitative evidence of speculation becoming entertainment. The Wall Street Journal reported in January 2025 that America is "addicted to parlay bets." Studies show sports betting significantly reduces household savings and increases credit card debt among financially constrained households. The National Council on Problem Gambling estimates $14 billion in social costs from problem gambling, with 38% of male sports bettors aged 18-49 reporting betting more than they should. Crypto adoption follows similar patterns. Coinbase has 108 million verified users. MetaMask has over 30 million monthly active users. These numbers represent genuine adoption rather than speculative bubbles that burst and disappear. The infrastructure exists and users remain engaged even when individual tokens collapse. Market structure has fundamentally shifted in ways that benefit the index holdings. The top 10 stocks now represent 38% of the S&P 500, matching dot-com bubble concentration levels. Passive flows create what Epsilon Theory's Michael Green calls "a giant mindless robot" market where price discovery occurs through flows rather than fundamental analysis. Social sentiment now leads price action rather than following it, and its global. South Koreans stream live perpetual futures trading like esports competitions in what they call "T-POP" (Trading as K-POP). Similar phenomena emerge in India and China. This is not an American cultural quirk but a global transformation in how markets operate. Lindzon himself expressed doubts about the thesis in August 2024. "The term 'degenerate economy' is sloppy in that I do not want to glorify the idea that you are on your own. I take pride in helping people learn the language of the markets. My utopian idea of this economy is that 'speculation is entertainment' and 'investing is a sport'. That is not happening." He considered changing the terminology but ultimately continued using it while emphasizing education and risk management. The discomfort stems from observing friends joke about investing in gambling addiction treatment centers as a growth industry. The normalization of behavior that previous generations would consider pathological creates ethical questions that performance data does not answer. The January 2025 launch of Trump and Melania memecoins crystallized these concerns. The $TRUMP token hit $60 billion in initial valuation three days before inauguration. This represents a massive wealth transfer from retail speculators to insiders rather than democratization of finance. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's founder, experienced a crisis of faith in February 2024: "Do I feel good when I hear people from crypto twitter and VC firms telling me that PvP KOL degen casino that's money-losing for over 99% of its own users is the best product market fit that crypto is going to get?" This captures the tension between builders wanting utility and markets demanding entertainment. Traditional value investors see casino-ification killing price discovery and allocating capital inefficiently. When GameStop or AMC trade based on social media sentiment rather than business fundamentals, markets stop performing their core function of directing resources toward productive uses. These concerns are valid, but they do not make the Degenerate Economy Index wrong as an investment thesis. Investors face a choice. They can refuse to participate in infrastructure they find morally questionable and accept lower returns. Or they can acknowledge that opposing a trend does not stop it from generating profits. The Degenerate Economy Index provides a framework for the latter approach. By focusing on infrastructure providers rather than attempting to pick winning meme stocks, investors gain exposure to the trend without participating in its most problematic aspects. Owning Nvidia does not require endorsing AI girlfriends. Owning Apple does not require approving of mobile gambling addiction. Owning CME Group does not require celebrating leveraged speculation by retail traders. These companies provide tools that serve many purposes, some productive and some destructive. The counterargument holds that providing the infrastructure makes you complicit in the outcomes. Often people seek out “ethical” investments which avoid alcohol companies, casinos, tobacco, or any industry with negative externalities. Investors must decide their own ethical boundaries. For now, the performance data suggests that those boundaries cost money. The 60 percentage point gap between the Degenerate Economy Index and the Nasdaq-100 over 18 months represents real wealth not created for those avoiding the trend. Lindzon’s advice to his son Max perhaps illustrates a middle path: if you are going to make a parlay bet, invest an equal amount in the Degenerate Economy Index. The Degenerate Economy entered what Lindzon calls "Ludicrous Mode" in January 2025. The SEC rescinded SAB 121, allowing banks to custody Bitcoin. David Sacks serves as Crypto Czar. Robinhood, Visa, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs all hit all-time highs simultaneously. Both old and new financial platforms benefit from the same trend. Traditional banks adding crypto custody compete with Coinbase while simultaneously validating the asset class. This represents market expansion rather than zero-sum competition. Lindzon predicts several developments that would further benefit index holdings. Vegas sportsbooks will morph into "degenerate economy clubs" combining gambling, trading, and entertainment. CNBC's Squawk Box could evolve into a global streaming phenomenon focused on trading as sport. On-chain peer-to-peer betting will expand to cover everything from stock movements to sports outcomes to prediction markets. The wealth gap will accelerate dramatically as asset owners vastly outperform wage earners. Retail participation may reach 30% of market volume, up from historical 20%, as platforms become more sophisticated. AI will replace traditional Wall Street analysts for many functions, further commoditizing financial research. For crypto specifically, Lindzon predicts that supply will crush demand. With 1 million tokens created weekly, most will fail spectacularly. This benefits infrastructure providers like Coinbase that collect fees regardless of which tokens succeed. The platforms always win. The question facing investors is whether this represents a temporary mania that will revert or a permanent transformation in market structure. The 18-month performance of the Degenerate Economy Index suggests the latter. The technological infrastructure exists and cannot be uninvented. The economic conditions driving participation show no signs of improving. The regulatory environment is becoming more permissive rather than restrictive. Traditional investors can question their sanity for participating in what they see as casino-ification of markets. The alternative is questioning their sanity for ignoring a trend that has doubled benchmark returns while showing no signs of reversal.

Title: Bully For Investment Banks!
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/bully-for-investment-banks/
Time Published: 2025-10-17T13:30:07Z
Full Content:
By Sean Ring PostedOctober 17, 2025 I remember getting my offer letter from Lehman Brothers in early 1997, a full 11 years before they went bankrupt, I hasten to add. For a whopping $34,000, I was theirs, green as a Granny Smith apple. My job was in a division called Global Corporate Equity Derivatives, and I was going to help the traders keep their trading books reconciled with the general ledger. It was my first, and last, accounting job, and it sucked from Day 1. But I didn’t know that, so I leaped with glee into my family’s New Jersey living room, and yelped, “Ma, I got the job!” My mother squealed, “I’m soooo proud of you!” And then she paused. “I always wondered how those banks made all that money.” I had no idea because my undergraduate macroeconomic classes were a heaping mess of Keynesian nonsense. They failed to mention things like money printing, interbank lending, and bailouts. I was about to get the education of my life. I remembered this episode fondly as I read that every major U.S. bank beat earnings estimates this quarter. JPM, MS, WFC, BAC, and GS shot the lights out. But the reasons why are no longer a mystery. After you read this piece, it won’t be a mystery to you, either. Sure, the Rothbardian reason that banks are closest to the money printer is still valid, perhaps more now than ever. And yes, during good times, CEOs idiotically decide to acquire or merge with another company in transactions that make money for white-shoed investment bankers, but not their shareholders. During bull markets, it’s almost impossible for banks’ sales and trading teams to lose money. That’s not even their doing. It’s their clients —the pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, endowment funds, and other asset managers—who want to hedge their bets. I’ll explain. Investment banks (the sell side) service asset managers, or the buy side. The buy-side is the people who take all of our assets and buy stuff, like stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate. Asset managers are buyers of mammoth amounts of stock. That means they are constantly long. Of course, if they’re long, they always want the market to go up. And, yes, that is, for the most part, true. But we must keep two things in mind, only one of which is obvious. The obvious one is they don’t want violent downward moves, like the March 2020 Covid crash. The not-so-obvious point is that they also don’t tend to want the market to move too violently upwards, either. It’s like “quality of earnings.” A nice, steady increase is good enough for most of them. Of course, TSLA quadrupling is just fine and dandy. But asset managers would’ve certainly been at least partially hedged. So asset managers do two things to combat a precipitous fall or to prepare for a “sideways move” in the stock. Here they are: An asset manager will go to their investment banks and say to them, “Listen, I’m long this stock that has, say, appreciated 40% in the past year. I need to hold on to it because it’s part of my investment plan, but I’m worried about the downside. Can I please buy a put from you?” When you take a long stock position and combine it with a long put position, you have what’s called portfolio protection. It synthetically creates a long call option on the stock. This means you’re still exposed to the upside, which is great, but you no longer have any downside. The asset manager eliminated that downside by paying the option premium. The second scenario is this: a fund manager may be forced to own a stock that is not particularly good—a dog, in asset management parlance—a stock that hasn’t moved up in many years and doesn’t pay the best dividend in the world. But they have to hold it because it’s a part of their index or basket. So what fund managers often do is sell call options against those stocks. They are what we call covered call positions, and, synthetically, they are short puts. The asset manager will do this for a few reasons: If you’ve got fund managers who are both long puts and short calls, who are long those calls and short those puts? The investment banks are. They facilitate this trade, so they are synthetically long the stock market. How is that? The investment banks are the ones who buy the calls from the fund managers and sell the puts to the fund managers. A long call plus a short put is equal to a long stock position. We call this an “ax.” Who are the two most prominent investment banks in the United States? Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, occasionally known as Government Sachs. Other universal banks like Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, and Bank of America also participate. Now you can see why there is an implied upward bias in the markets. And, of course, vested interests don’t want the markets to come down. This gives credence to rumors of a plunge protection scheme and the “Fed put” that Alan Greenspan was famous for. BTFD takes on new meaning when you understand this state of affairs. But if you are someone who doesn’t have many assets yet, you’re waiting to get in on the action. And waiting, and waiting… You haven’t been exposed to the natural price deflation seen in economic cycles because banks, asset managers, the government, and the media have done their level best to eliminate deflation altogether. Guido Hülsmann, in his masterful essay Deflation and Liberty (page 26), gives us the exact reason why the vested interests will not yield to price depreciation: There is only one fundamental change that deflation brings about. It radically modifies the structure of ownership. Firms financed per credits go bankrupt because at the lower level of prices they can no longer pay back the credits they had incurred without anticipating the deflation. Private households with mortgages and other considerable debts to pay back go bankrupt, because with the decline of money prices their monetary income declines too whereas their debts remain at the nominal level. The very attempt to liquidate assets to pay back debt entails a further reduction of the value of those assets, thus making it even more difficult for them to come even with their creditors. The game may be rigged, but all you have to do to benefit like the banks is get long the market and stay long. Until the market finally, mercifully, turns.

Title: AVGO: Why Broadcom Stock Jumped 110%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/17/avgo-why-broadcom-stock-jumped-110/
Time Published: 2025-10-17T12:45:26Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom (AVGO)’s stock didn’t merely rise - it soared over 100%, driven by more than just impressive figures. A nearly 10% increase in revenue and a remarkable 71% rise in net margin suggested enhanced efficiency, but the true excitement lay just beneath the surface. Investors are rallying around the company’s ambitious advancements in artificial intelligence, selling application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) — custom chips that big tech companies use to run AI workloads efficiently, besides supplying high-speed networking solutions. Buoyed by stronger-than-expected Q2 results and a wave of upward analyst revisions, Broadcom’s latest surge reflects not just growth, but a strategic evolution — making its stock’s rise a story worth watching. So what is going on here? The stock price surged an impressive 108%, fueled by a mix of significant factors. Revenue saw a modest increase of 9.9%, and the net margin experienced a notable rise of 71%, indicating enhanced profitability. In the meantime, the valuation, reflected by the P/E multiple, grew by 11%, pointing to increasing investor confidence. Collectively, these elements illustrate the reasons behind the price movement - creating the opportunity to examine the specific events, announcements, and strategic actions that contributed to this strong performance. Before delving into the events that contributed to the stock increase, here’s what market wisdom suggests: investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant value in a more diversified approach, exemplified by the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you purchase one stock you prefer or develop a portfolio designed to thrive across market cycles? Our data reveal that the High Quality Portfolio has turned the uncertainty of stock selection into consistent market-beating performance. This portfolio is incorporated into the asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management – a Boston-based wealth manager and Trefis partner – whose asset allocation framework generated positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P experienced losses of more than 40%. Separately, see – S&P 500 Poised For A 40% Crash? Here Is Why Broadcom Stock Moved Our Current Assessment Of AVGO Stock Opinion: We currently consider AVGO stock appealing yet volatile. Why? Explore the full narrative. Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to understand what shapes our current viewpoint. Risk: Nevertheless, AVGO is not exempt from significant declines. It dropped nearly 48% during the Covid pandemic, around 35% during the inflation shock in 2021, and about 27% during the 2018 market correction. Even with strong fundamentals, it's evident that the stock can experience a sharp decline when the market shifts. Good companies still feel the impact when sentiment changes drastically. Consistently picking winners is a challenging endeavor – particularly given the volatility associated with individual stocks. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has shown a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4-year period. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother investment journey, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

October 17, 2025 08:45 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and Kraig Labs 24/7 Market News and Kraig Labs DENVER, Oct. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and information, reports that, as the fashion industry confronts mounting pressure to overhaul its wasteful practices, Circular Fashion is emerging as both an ethical mandate and a massive economic opportunity. Kraig Biocraft Laboratories (OTCQB: KBLB), the undisputed global leader in the development and commercialization of spider silk, is positioning to be at the forefront of this transformation, offering a scalable, biodegradable alternative to petroleum-based fabrics that could reshape the $1.5 trillion global apparel industry. The Circular Economy’s Billion-Dollar Fashion Upside Circular fashion, a model that emphasizes durability, recyclability, and closed-loop systems, aims to eliminate the staggering 92 million tons of textile waste discarded globally each year. Analysts project the circular fashion market could grow to over $200 billion by 2030, driven by consumer demand, ESG mandates, and regulatory changes. Governments and major fashion houses alike are accelerating toward sustainability targets: Kraig Labs: Bioengineered Spider Silk for the Circular Age Kraig Labs’ recombinant spider silk, produced through proprietary silkworm-based biotechnology, offers a powerful solution for this new era. Unlike synthetic fibers derived from fossil fuels, spider silk is both biodegradable and renewable, while delivering extraordinary strength, elasticity, and breathability. The Kraig Labs spider silk platform will enable luxury and performance brands to meet sustainability mandates without sacrificing quality or performance and support an entirely new circular materials economy. By utilizing traditional silk production infrastructure and replacing the silk protein with engineered spider silk protein, Kraig Labs is able to offer a scalable and economically viable supply chain. This puts the company in a unique position to help apparel brands replace unsustainable materials like polyester, nylon, and conventional silk. Economic Impact: Premium Pricing Meets ESG Demand With the luxury fashion market expected to surpass $330 billion by 2030, and sustainable fashion already outpacing industry growth at large, spider silk could capture a significant slice of this fast-expanding segment: Circular fashion principles also open the door for take-back programs, rental models, and closed-loop recycling, where biodegradable spider silk garments could fully decompose or be re-engineered into new fibers, further boosting the sustainability narrative and lifecycle economics. KBLB: A Biomaterial Solution Whose Time Has Come Kraig Labs (OTCQB: KBLB) has already demonstrated success with its spider silk fibers, developed through years of R&D and protected by an extensive IP portfolio. As the company begins ramping up commercial-scale production, the timing aligns with fashion’s urgent pivot to circularity and transparency. Key catalysts include: As fashion shifts away from fast-disposable goods toward long-lasting, sustainable, and recyclable materials, Kraig Labs’ spider silk is emerging as a leading contender to define the future of circular fashion.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Although Advanced Micro Devices increased by 47% over the last month, its counterpart Nvidia could be the preferable option. Continuously assessing alternatives is essential to a robust investment strategy. NVIDIA (NVDA) stock presents outstanding revenue growth during critical periods, higher profitability, and comparatively lower valuation compared to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock, indicating that investing in NVDA might be more advantageous. Investing in a single stock can be precarious, yet there is significant value in a broader diversified strategy we employ with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management - a wealth manager from the Boston area - whose asset allocation strategies produced positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P experienced declines exceeding 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into this asset allocation framework to provide clients with improved returns while minimizing risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a less turbulent investment journey, as evidenced by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Tech industry stalling as AI takes over, with junior roles cut in half

Graduate tech jobs are down 46% from last year When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A new report from the Institute of Student Employers (ISE) has found that the UK tech industry has experienced a 46% drop in tech graduate jobs from 2024, and a further 53% drop projected in 2026. This probably won’t come as much of a shock to many, but recent tech graduates most likely have AI to blame for the dramatic decline in jobs on offer. After all, why train a junior worker for basic digital tasks, coding, or data analysis when you could ask AI to do it? The UK isn’t the only country suffering. Junior tech workers are in trouble across the world. The Stanford Digital Economy Lab released statistics confirming that entry level tech job postings are down 67% between 2023-2024, with a 13% drop in employment for 22-25 year-olds since AI arrived on the scene at the end of 2022. Tech jobs aren’t the only ones facing this issue. Employers reduced hiring by 8% in the last academic year (2024/2025), and another 7% is predicted for the coming year - but this figure focuses on responses from three large employers. “It is a tough market for students and young people in general. There is not much churn in the labour market and young people are suffering,” Stephen Isherwod, joint chief executive of ISE, told the Financial Times. The data suggests that organisations are simply focusing on hiring experienced workers, and cutting juniors out of the company structure as a cost saving measure, and to become more efficient. Whilst companies may see short-term gains with this strategy, it sets up a scenario for 10-20 years time when experienced professionals are set to retire, but no one has invested in training any juniors to take their place.

Title: Will the AI Bubble Trigger a Financial Crisis?

Experts might not expect a stock-market crash to cause a financial crisis, but what if they are wrong? With leverage built up in so many parts of the system and asset-price movements so closely correlated, the current US financial system looks like a tinder box just waiting for a spark to land on it. WASHINGTON, DC – OpenAI Co-Founder Sam Altman, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have joined the chorus of people talking about an AI bubble and expressing concern that the US economy will nosedive when it bursts. But what would a post-bubble nosedive look like? Given the weakness in almost every other sector of the US economy, it could well mean a recession. Economic slumps come in many flavors, though, and the worst tend to follow from financial crises. Yet most experts (with a few exceptions) have not warned of the AI bubble causing a financial crisis. Instead, the conventional wisdom seems to be that if there is a recession, it will look more like the one that followed the dot-com bubble in 2000 than the one following the 2008 global financial crisis. History does provide some support for this view. One well known paper on bubbles and financial crises concludes that “the post-WW2 era appears to have weathered numerous equity price bubbles that did not turn into financial crisis episodes.” But the authors also note that equity-price bubbles can precipitate financial crises if they are fueled by borrowed money. After all, the Great Depression was preceded by a debt-fueled “roaring 20s” equity bubble. This matters because, as economist Noah Smith points out, banks are funding “private credit” funds that in turn are lending money to fund the data-center construction for an anticipated AI boom. Smith wonders whether we will see defaults on those construction loans when the AI bubble bursts, and whether private credit losses could cause a crisis for the banks that ultimately extended that credit. It is also worth pondering whether a bursting AI bubble could compromise the ability of other non-bank financial institutions to repay their loans. A recent JPMorgan analyst note on hedge-fund trading observes that concentration in the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks (companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia) remains near historic highs. Yet the prices of these stocks are highly dependent on the companies’ AI ambitions. If they fall short of their goals, and prices come crashing down, highly leveraged hedge funds may be forced into fire sales, unloading stocks to meet margin calls or repay bank loans. And if those fire sales don’t fetch enough cash, the funds will default on their repayment obligations, potentially undermining the financial condition of the broker-dealers, primary dealers, and banks that extended them credit. Moreover, the same dynamics will also drive down the prices of tech stocks further, potentially forcing other leveraged financial institutions to sell off their portfolios, and so on. Nor should we assume that financial institutions desperate for cash will restrict themselves to selling off tech stocks. On the contrary, they may need – or prefer – to dump other types of assets, transmitting problems to other asset markets.

SUBSCRIBE NOW Such a scenario is not far-fetched. The Fed reports that hedge-fund leverage hit historically high levels in 2024, and in a September 2025 commentary, analyst Adam Josephson notes that “hedge fund borrowing/leverage [is] at a record high of $6.2 trillion, up more than 25% vs. a year ago at the end of March.” Specifically, outstanding margin loans from broker-dealers and repurchase agreements from primary dealers are at historically high levels. And bank lending (particularly lending by large banks) to non-bank financial institutions – including broker-dealers, primary dealers, and the hedge funds themselves – is also significantly elevated, with bank loans to NBFIs now accounting for “$1.7 trillion in bank loans, or 13% of loans outstanding.” Meanwhile, US financial regulators continue to permit this expansion of leverage, as well as greenlighting the integration of traditional financial markets with crypto markets (which are also rife with leverage). Despite narratives about Bitcoin and other crypto assets serving as a hedge against risks in other markets, their price movements are highly correlated with equities. Thus, we should expect to see crypto prices fall when the AI bubble bursts, and not just because of fire-sale dynamics. Both crypto and the AI bubble have been inflated by the same kinds of narratives about new technologies shattering old paradigms. If evidence of AI’s limitations starts to permeate the public consciousness during a market crash, more pessimistic sentiment on tech assets could well undermine crypto hype as well. This could then prompt a crash in Ponzi-like crypto assets such as Bitcoin, as well as runs on asset-backed stablecoins. If stablecoin issuers are forced to withdraw their cash reserves from banks, they could trigger a run on those institutions; and if they are forced to dump Treasuries from their reserves, another critically important financial market could be sucked into the maelstrom. Experts might not expect a stock-market crash to cause a financial crisis, but what if they are wrong? With leverage built up in so many parts of the system and asset-price movements so correlated, what if the financial system is a tinder box that could explode when the first spark lands on it? Of course, the financial system may well weather the bursting of the AI bubble, especially if the end arrives with a low hiss rather than a sudden bang. But we shouldn’t count on it.

Title: Axon Enterprise Stock Dropped 13% – Have You Assessed The Risk
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/17/axon-enterprise-stock-dropped-13--have-you-assessed-the-risk/
Time Published: 2025-10-17T10:02:17Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Axon Enterprise (AXON) stock has decreased by 13.3% over the course of 21 trading days. Do you already own this stock, or are you considering purchasing it? You may want to rethink your decision based on the valuation, as the stock appears expensive. Take a look at the following data: While we typically prefer to buy on dips if the fundamentals are sound – for AXON, see Buy or Sell AXON Stock – we also remain cautious about falling knives. Specifically, it's important to evaluate whether we can hold on to the stock if conditions worsen and AXON declines another 20-30% to around $457. What is the worst-case scenario? We refer to this as downturn resilience. It turns out that the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We measure this by considering (a) how much the stock declined and (b) how quickly it rebounded. AXON stock has suffered a significant decline recently, and we currently view it as relatively pricey. While this might seem like a buying opportunity, there are substantial risks associated with relying on one stock. Conversely, there is great value in the more diversified approach we advocate with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth manager situated in the Boston area – whose asset allocation strategies produced positive returns during the 2008-09 financial crisis when the S&P lost over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into this asset allocation framework to deliver improved returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a smoother ride, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – S&P 500 Poised For A 40% Crash? Here are the details, but first, for some context: AXON provides conducted energy devices and hardware-software solutions for law enforcement to capture, store, manage, share, and analyze digital evidence globally. Concerned that AXON may drop further? You might explore the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which includes a selection of 30 stocks that have consistently outperformed its benchmark, encompassing all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded improved returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother ride, as is clear from the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: META Appears To Be A More Attractive Buy Compared To Alphabet Stock

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. META is Alphabet's counterpart within the Interactive Media & Services sector that possesses: 1) A lower valuation (P/OpInc) in comparison to Alphabet stock2) Yet higher revenue and operating income growth This disparity between valuation and performance could suggest that investing in META stock is more advantageous than purchasing GOOGL stock Investing in individual stocks can be precarious, but there is significant value in adopting a broader diversified strategy as we do with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth management firm in the Boston area – which has implemented asset allocation strategies yielding positive returns during the 2008-09 timeframe when the S&P declined over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into this asset allocation strategy to deliver improved returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a smoother investment experience, as shown in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – S&P 500 Poised For A 40% Crash? OpInc = Operating Income, P/OpInc = Price To Operating Income Ratio Do these figures, however, encompass the entire picture? Read Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock to determine if Alphabet still possesses an advantage that remains viable beneath the surface. For context, Alphabet (GOOGL) offers a variety of products and services, including advertising, Android, Chrome, hardware, cloud solutions, health technology, and internet services across diverse markets. This is merely one method for assessing investments. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio conducts a more comprehensive evaluation and is designed to mitigate stock-specific risks while providing potential growth opportunities. A method to evaluate whether Alphabet stock is currently overpriced compared to other tickers would involve examining how these metrics compared among companies exactly one year ago. Specifically, if there has been a notable trend reversal for Alphabet over the past 12 months, then the ongoing disparity may likely reverse. Conversely, sustained underperformance in revenue and operating income growth for Alphabet would reinforce the notion that its stock is overpriced relative to its competitors but might not revert soon. OpInc = Operating Income Considering buying based on valuation, while appealing, must be assessed thoroughly from various perspectives. This multi-faceted evaluation is precisely how we develop Trefis portfolio strategies. If you desire potential gains with a more stable journey than an individual stock offers, explore the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, delivering over 91% returns since its inception.

Business Shares in Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica rose 14 per cent to hit an all-time high on Friday, adding nearly $20 billion in market value as investor enthusiasm for its AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta glasses gathered momentum. The Paris-listed group, founded by late Italian entrepreneur Leonardo Del Vecchio and a possible contender in the race to buy fashion group Armani, reported on Thursday third-quarter sales growth of 11.7 per cent from a year ago to 6.9 billion euros ($8.1 billion). The results beat expectations and marked the company's best quarterly performance ever amid strong demand for wearable products such as the smart glasses it has been developing with Meta since before the pandemic. Even though the smart glasses business has until now accounted for only a fraction of EssilorLuxottica's total revenue, it has become a focal point for analysts and investors, as well as a catalyst for the company's investments.

Title: 'Non-Productive' Gold Zooms to $30T Market Cap, Leaving Bitcoin, Nvidia, Apple, Google Far Behind
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/17/non-productive-gold-zooms-to-usd30t-market-cap-leaving-bitcoin-nvidia-apple-google-far-behind

Full Content:
Gold (XAU), a traditional store of value but also a "non-productive" asset, has surged to a market capitalization exceeding $30 trillion in 2025, dwarfing digital gold, bitcoin, and U.S.-listed tech giants alike. The yellow metal's price per ounce has surged 66% to a record high of approximately $4,380, with prices rising 13% in October alone, according to TradingView data. This rally has pushed gold's market capitalization to about $30.42 trillion, based on an estimated above-ground global supply of 216,265 metric tonnes, as reported by the World Gold Council. Nvidia (NVDA), arguably the most consequential company globally due to its foundational role in powering the AI revolution, holds a distant second place with a market capitalization of $4.42 trillion. It is followed by Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (Google), silver, Amazon (AMZN). Meanwhile, bitcoin BTC$108,147.03, considered digital gold, ranked eighth with a market cap of $2.17 trillion. Gold's premium to tech giants doesn't necessarily reflect a positive outlook for the global economy because it is a non-productive asset. Unlike stocks, bonds, or real estate, gold does not generate dividends, interest, or rent, nor does it contribute directly to economic activity. Its price is directly tied to its appeal as a traditional safe haven and store of value asset as opposed to underlying cash flow or productive output. So, the fact that it trades at a significant premium to the most valuable tech companies is likely a telltale sign of economic malaise. It indicates that investors are seeking refuge in perceived safe havens amid broader economic uncertainty. Ken Griffin, CEO of Citadel, recently expressed significant concern over the trend of investors viewing gold as a safer asset than the U.S. dollar, calling the yellow metal's record rally as cautionary signal about the U.S. economy's stability. According to analysis, the rally has been catalyzed by fiscal imprudence in the U.S. and across the advanced world, sticky inflation, geopolitical tensions and expectations for the Fed rate cuts. The consensus is for the uptrend to continue. Features that describe gold as a non-productive store of value also apply to bitcoin.

Title: Diane Keaton, Her Own Brand; Jennifer Meyer Jewelry at 20; Spring 2026 Runway Accessories to Try Now

Full Content:
WrapStyle: Diane Keaton was not defined by any fashion brand, she was her own Diane Keaton was not defined by any fashion brand, she was her own. Jennifer Meyer’s trailblazing L.A. jewelry business at 20. Moncler’s epic Robert De Niro and Al Pacino campaign. Spring 2026 runway accessories to try now and Native American designer Jamie Okuma’s must-have moccasins. Diane Keaton had personal style the likes of which we may never see again, not just because she was a singular creative, but because of the celebrity-fashion industrial complex we’re now living in. Keaton, who died Saturday, showed that there could be power in covering up, even in Hollywood; made androgyny approachable and whimsical; and later found a distinctive uniform that was eccentric yet controlled — structured suits, turtlenecks, long skirts and coats, gloves, hats and wide belts in black and white. Although she wore designer clothing over the years — Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani and Thom Browne, to name a few — and modeled in a J.Crew campaign, Keaton wasn’t defined by any one brand. She was her own. If you can find it (it’s sold out nearly everywhere now), Keaton’s coffee table book “Fashion First” explains how she started experimenting with clothing from an early age, often altering Goodwill finds, then eased into her 1970s style with “Annie Hall,” before finding her uniform in the 2000s. It covers the what and the how of her style, but sadly is light on the why. Still, it’s full of fun photos, some of them hilariously annotated. “Someone please help me!” Keaton writes of a 1980s fashion don’t. There were no stylists, no glam squads, just her. And she owned it, for better or worse. The fashion scene in Los Angeles certainly has changed over the last two decades. Back in 2005, magazines like Us Weekly and In Touch were the chroniclers of celebrity style and the engines of discovery for brands. Jewelry designer Jennifer Meyer was perfectly suited to harness the power of Hollywood having grown up in it as the daughter of industry vet Ronald Meyer. Celebrating 20 years in business, she threw a party last week to celebrate her relaxed brand of luxury jewelry to layer and live in, and there was so much good will, even her ex Tobey Maguire showed up. The crowd mingling over wine and canapés in Meyer’s Brentwood home was a testament to how much L.A. has grown into a fashion business capital, with Erin and Sara Foster (Favorite Daughter), Tina Chen Craig (U Beauty) and Andrea Lieberman (A.L.C.) among those who have built brands here by tapping into L.A.’s entertainment and creator economy. “When she had this idea, I remember thinking, OK, good luck,” Sara Foster said. “She’d sit in the back office of her house all day designing and bagging samples. And then it just snowballed. I don’t wear her jewelry because she’s my best friend of 25 years, I wear her jewelry because you can sleep in it, but you also get stopped in the street because someone is desperate to know what that piece is. That’s the sign of a real jewelry designer.” Meyers’ first celebrity fan was Jennifer Aniston, who wore her Gold Leaf necklace in the 2006 film “The Break-Up.” “It didn’t break the Internet because the Internet wasn’t booming. But it broke Us Weekly and InStyle and from there, she wore all kinds of pieces I couldn’t keep in [stock],” Meyer said. “Courtney Cox’s hoop earrings were in InStyle, which came out monthly then. People were just waiting for it so they could see what to buy,” she said of early-aughts tabloid fashion culture. Meyer’s 18-karat Good Luck charm, which features all the good luck symbols—an elephant, evil eye, Om, horseshoe, four-leaf clover, and heart—has been another key piece, worn by Rihanna, Alicia Keys and many guests at the party as well. “Sometimes people come up to me on the street to tell me about their good luck, how they gave it to their daughter and she got pregnant, all these great stories,” Meyer said. Still, she’s as surprised as anyone to still be at it. “I invested hardly any money, there was no overhead, so the risk was minimal. And I wasn’t scared,” Meyer said of starting out. “I was just thinking you know what, let’s see how this goes and suddenly it’s 20 years later.” Next year, she’s looking forward to reopening her store at Palisades Village. “I can’t wait to bring business back,” she said. “L.A. is an amazing community, and we really come together, especially when people are in need.” One of the biggest trends from the Spring 2026 runways was, in fact, jewelry, which seems strategic during an economic slowdown. Costume jewelry typically has lower price points than apparel and leather goods which could help draw in some of the aspirational shoppers that have been fleeing luxury brands in recent years, scared away by relentless price hikes. I love getting a jump on the next season by shopping things in my closet, on The RealReal, or wherever, and mimicking runway looks. A white button-down shirt, à la Chanel, has already been moved to the front of my closet. I’m also ready to dive back into my jewelry box like it’s the early 2010s, when Jenna Lyons at J.Crew and Michelle Obama in the White House were setting the trend with statement pieces. One thing I’ve already dusted off is a 1980s enamel and rhinestone bow-shaped brooch I bought at the Paris flea market. Inspired by Tory Burch’s runway styling (see above), I pinned it to the collar of a polo sweater. Dig up those island souvenirs, too, because Burch also had a ton of seashell pendant necklaces, also seen at Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Versace and Dries Van Noten. This Celine tailored “neckmess” as they say, is already one of the most shared Spring 2026 images on fashion Substack. I love the juxtaposition of the global beads and the white suit jacket, and it’s easy to replicate. Silk scarves were also a fun trend at Celine, as seen below. “Why don’t you tie one to your leather-bound agenda?” as Diana Vreeland would say. For the first time in a while, Hermès sent its famous (and relatively affordable) silk scarves down the runway, styled in several ways, including at the neck intertwined with diamond necklaces—a look I plan to try with a thin chain. The luxury brand also showed a scarf bag, which has to cost less than a Birkin, right? Statement earrings are back too—the bigger, the better—from chandeliers at Saint Laurent to vintage-style flower clip-ons at Chloé. At Balmain, ropes of shell beads blurred the line between necklace and top in the coolest way. All of it converged in the Chanel collection where the fire coral necklace was a favorite. Brooches, big earrings and ropes of beads were here, too. The message? Just start piling it on, you can’t go wrong. Speaking of Chanel, newly-minted ambassador Ayo Edebiri has already stepped out in one of the best looks from designer Matthieu Blazy’s Spring 2026 runway debut. She wore the gown (with a slight modification, the bow moved to the other shoulder) to the premiere of “After the Hunt” in London and looked like a dream. In other brand news, fans of Maria Grazia Chiuri’s feminist-centered, commercially-minded work at Dior can now follow her to Fendi. Ending months of speculation, the designer is heading home to Rome as the new chief creative officer for the Roman fashion house. There are so few female directors of luxury houses, so it’s good to see her back at the top. We’ll see if she can strike gold twice at a Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy-owned brand—and how similar or different her vision will be from Dior to Fendi. With Jonathan Anderson’s Dior skewing much younger, it could be an opportunity for Fendi to pick up the lost Dior generation. In one of the all-time best celebrity campaigns, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are now modeling for uber-luxe outerwear brand Moncler. Titled “Warmer Together,” the campaign features the Hollywood titans, who have been friends for 50 years, wearing Moncler puffers in cinematic black-and-white photos by Platon, including the choice shot above of the duo gazing at the Manhattan skyline. The advertising blitz includes photos and short films, and is running across outdoor, web and social, so you’ll be seeing a lot of it. There is also a newly recorded rendition of Bill Withers’ “Lean on Me” by Moncler ambassador Tobe Nwigwe, as part of the campaign. Pacino and De Niro have appeared in multiple films together throughout their long friendship, including “The Godfather: Part II,” “Righteous Kill,” “The Irishman” and more. “Warmth was never about the outside. It was always about what was happening on the inside,” De Niro says in the teaser film, his voice like a warm cup of cocoa on a winter day. “Friendship is the greatest thing you can have,” Pacino adds. Getting these two together is a flex for CEO Remo Ruffini and Moncler, which saw more than $1 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025. The born-in-the-Alps brand has been looking to the U.S. for growth and will show its Fall 2026 collection in the Hollywood winter haven of Aspen on Jan. 31, 2026. It’s sure to be celeb-packed: Moncler’s last show in snowy Courchevel drew dozens of stars, including Jessica Chastain, Adrien Brody and Anne Hathaway. Native American fashion designer Jamie Okuma has dressed Lily Gladstone and Jessica Matten for the red carpet, is a finalist for the 2025 CFDA Vogue Fashion Fund and her work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian among other institutions. Now, fresh off her New York Fashion Week debut, Okuma has a new collaboration offering a taste of her museum-worthy beadwork at an accessible price point. The gorgeous Manitobah x Jamie Okuma Modern Moc Chukkas ($260) are decorated with floral beadwork designed by Okuma, who is Shoshone-Bannock and Luiseno based in La Jolla, Calif. The design is inspired by her grandmother’s artistry (there’s a long line of creative gifts in the family; Jamie’s mom, Sandra Okuma, is also a renowned artist) and the traditional styles of her tribes in the Great Basin and Plateau regions. Manitobah is a Métis-founded Canadian shoe company that has funneled more than $1 million back to Indigenous artisans, supporting communities and preserving traditions through education, employment and collaboration. The drop is part of the Manitobah Artist Series, which brings in creatives to craft products that honor their stories—from sketch to marketing campaign. The floral Chukkas are limited edition, and Okuma has a lot of serious fans, so they’ll go fast, but there is a possibility of a future restock according to Manitobah reps. Meanwhile, the ready-to-wear collection Okuma just showed at NYFW is available on her website. Prada has been somewhat quiet retail-wise in Southern California in recent years compared to its luxury peers, but the Italian brand just opened a new 5,000-square-foot store at Westfield Topanga. The boutique features an illuminated façade in the brand’s iconic pastel green with a repeating triangle pattern echoing the brand’s logo. Inside, the black-and-white checkered marble floor pays homage to the original Prada store in Milan’s Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. The Topanga store has the full run of men’s and women’s ready-to-wear, Re-Nylon outerwear, the new Prada Explore handbags, the latest fall shoes and more. It’s the latest arrival at Westfield Topanga, which opened three years ago to cater to the monied West Valley — aka Kardashian Country. In that time, the shopping center has added 62 new stores — Hermès, Dior, Dolce & Gabbana and Rolex, to name a few — and now boasts the largest concentration of luxury retailers in L.A. County outside of Rodeo Drive. Maybe it’s time for a “Valley Girl” reboot! Forwarded this newsletter?Subscribe here to get WrapStyle directly every week! Have a news story for our readers?
