Good e-Reader 14 February 2025 by Angela Waterfield Leave a Comment Amazon’s recent decision to shut down all seven of its Quebec warehouses, laying off more than 1,900 workers, is more than just another round of corporate restructuring—it’s a flashpoint in the ongoing battle between multinational corporations and labor unions. The Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), representing the affected workers, has wasted no time launching legal action, seeking to annul the layoffs, reopen the warehouses, and secure compensation for employees. The timing of Amazon’s move is suspect, coming less than a year after the successful unionization of its DXT4 warehouse in Laval—the first Amazon facility in Canada to achieve this milestone. Amazon insists the closures are part of a “strategic shift” aimed at optimizing its North American delivery model. However, labor advocates see it differently, arguing that the timing suggests retaliation rather than efficiency. An Amazon spokesperson stated, “Our goal is to align operations with evolving market demands,” but did not directly address concerns about union-busting. Amazon has indicated a willingness to discuss the matter with Canadian and Quebec officials but has not signaled any intention to reverse its decision. This lack of transparency is fueling skepticism, particularly among workers who see a pattern reminiscent of past corporate tactics. CSN president Caroline Senneville didn’t mince words in a press conference, calling out Amazon’s reasoning as a smokescreen: They’re not fooling anyone. The only reason for Amazon to have a different business model just for Quebec is that there’s a union here and an arbitrator could have imposed a first collective agreement as early as the summer of 2025.” If this sounds familiar, it’s because it is. In 2005, Walmart shut down a store in Jonquière, Quebec, shortly after workers unionized—a move the courts later ruled was a violation of labor law. Now, history appears to be repeating itself, only this time, Amazon is the corporate heavyweight on the defensive. Beyond the immediate labor dispute, Amazon’s decision has ignited broader political and economic tensions. Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne has suggested that the federal government could reevaluate its business relationship with Amazon, including contracts with Amazon Web Services. If that happens, the financial stakes could extend far beyond a few warehouses. Meanwhile, the CSN is upping the ante by urging the public to hit Amazon where it hurts—its bottom line. The union is calling for a boycott, encouraging Canadians to stop shopping on Amazon and cancel their Prime subscriptions. Given the rising anti-American corporate sentiment fueled by U.S.-Canada tensions—most recently exacerbated by President Trump’s tariff threats—this call to action may find a very receptive audience. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a recent press conference, “Canadians are more united than ever.” At its core, this battle isn’t just about one company or even one industry—it’s about the growing friction between corporate behemoths and the workers who fuel their profits. The pandemic solidified Amazon’s dominance, but it also heightened awareness of the often-precarious conditions for its workforce. Unionization efforts, once seen as nearly impossible in Amazon’s high-turnover, high-pressure environment, are gaining momentum. Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos’ latest public appearance only fuels accusations of his corporate opportunism. Once critical of Donald Trump threat to democracy, Bezos was front and center at Trump’s 2025 inauguration, alongside other tech giants like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. His presence signals a stark reversal from his 2016 warnings about “Trump’s authoritarian tendencies” are “eroding our democracy”. Rather than ideological alignment, Bezos’ attendance suggests that his business interests take precedence over past political stances. To be fair, he may have had a genuine change of heart, but for many employees and consumers, his shifting stance only deepens uncertainty about where he truly stands. The outcome of the CSN’s lawsuit remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: This isn’t just a labor dispute—it’s a test case for the power dynamics between multinational corporations, governments, and organized labor in an era of economic turbulence. Amazon may be accustomed to controlling the narrative, but in Quebec, the fight is far from over. An avid book reader and proud library card holder, Angela is new to the world of e-Readers.

Title: ‘AI may become judge, jury and executioner’ – global risks expert to RT
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/612575-ai-may-become-judge/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T18:55:24Z
Full Content:
Last week, Google revised its artificial intelligence principles, removing the company’s stance against using AI to develop weapons or technologies or directly facilitate injury to people, or for surveillance that violates internationally accepted norms. Google’s AI head Demis Hassabis said the guidelines were being overhauled in a changing world and that AI should protect “national security”. RT has interviewed Dr. Mathew Maavak, a senior consultant for Malaysia’s National Artificial Intelligence Roadmap 2021-2025 (AI-Rmap), scholar on global risks, geopolitics, strategic foresight, governance and AI, on the potential consequences of Google’s new policies. RT: Does this mean that Google and other corporations will now start making AI-powered weapons? Dr. Mathew Maavak: First and foremost, Google was largely the creation of the US national security apparatus or simply, the “deep state”.The origins of many, if not all, Big Tech entities today can be traced to ground-breaking research undertaken by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and its predecessor the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). So, the quasi-private entity called Google is inextricably beholden to its “national security” origins, as are other Big Tech entities. Weaponizing AI and creating AI-powered weapons is a natural progression for these entities. Microsoft has long established its own “military empire”. Furthermore, Big Tech platforms have been extensively used for data and intelligence-gathering activities worldwide. This is a reason why China has banned many US Big Tech software and apps. A nation cannot be sovereign if it is beholden to Big Tech! As for Google changing its guidelines on AI, this should not come as a surprise. Big Tech was actively promoting universal AI governance models through various high-profile institutional shills, United Nations agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), think tanks and national governments. Through my recent work in this field, it became abundantly clear that the US government sought to stifle the development of indigenous AI worldwide by promoting half-baked and turgid AI Governance models that are riddled with contradictions. The gap between lofty aspirations and longstanding realities are simply unbridgeable. The same playbook was deployed to push Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) schemes worldwide – imposing heavy costs on developing nations and corporations alike. Now, the US and Big Capital are ditching the very ESG schemes they had devised. Unfortunately, many nations fell for these ploys, investing significant money and resources into building fanciful ESG and AI frameworks. These nations risk becoming permanently dependent on Big Tech under what I call “AI neo-colonialism”. Alphabet’s Google and YouTube, Microsoft’s Bing and Elon Musk’s X have long weaponized their platforms before this recent change in AI policy. Big Tech’s search algorithms have been weaponized to erase dissenters and contrarian platforms from the digital landscape, effectively imposing a modern-day damnatio memoriae.I have to use the Russian search engine Yandex in order to retrieve my old articles. RT: Why is this change being made now? Dr. Mathew Maavak: All weapons systems increasingly rely on AI. The Russia-Ukrainian conflict alone has seen AI being used in the battlefield. The extensive use of drones, with possible swarm intelligence capabilities, is just one out of many anecdotal examples of AI usage in Ukraine. You cannot create next-generation weapons and countermeasures without AI. You cannot bring a knife to a gunfight, as the old saying goes. It must be noted that one of the most profitable and future-proof sectors, with guaranteed returns on investments, is the Military-Industrial Complex. Weaponizing AI and making AI-powered weapons is just a natural course of action for Big Tech. It is also quite telling that the leaders of the two AI superpowers — the United States and China — skipped the recent Paris AI Summit. The event devolved into a scripted talk shop orchestrated by Big Tech. Alongside the United Kingdom, the United States also refused to sign the declaration on making AI “safe for all.” Clearly, this event was staged to suppress AI innovation in developing nations while legitimizing the weaponization of AI by major powers. RT: Google’s ‘principles’, to begin with, are set by Google itself, are voluntary and non-binding under any law. So theoretically nothing was preventing the company from just going ahead with any kind of AI research it wanted. Why did it feel the need to make it “official”? Dr. Mathew Maavak: Google’s so-called “principles” were never determined by the company alone. They were a mere sop for public consumption, perfectly encapsulated by its laughably cynical motto: “Don’t be evil.” Its parent company Alphabet is owned by the usual suspects from Big Capital such as Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street etc. – all of whom are private arms of the US deep state. An entity like Google cannot conduct “any kind of AI research” as its activities have to conform to the diktats of its primary stakeholders. Google formalized its new weaponization policy because the public’s stake in its ownership pie is virtually nonexistent. RT: Is it time to come up with international laws regarding military AI – like Google’s principles before the recent change, but enforceable? Dr. Mathew Maavak: As I have alluded to earlier, various international AI Governance models – all of whom are pretty much a facsimile of each other – were surreptitiously-formulated by the likes of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and other members of the so-called Tech Bros. Nations were just given the illusion of having a stake in this global AI legal and ethics matrix. Bureaucrats merely rubber-stamped whatever Big Tech promoted through various actors and avenues. At the same time, dissenters to this travesty were systematically ostracised. They may however end up having the last laugh in a coming AI-linked SHTF event. (I will save this line of inquiry for another day). There are other vexing issues to consider here: How does one define “AI war crime” within an international legal framework? Is it even possible to come up with a universal consensus? The operator of an armed drone responsible for wiping out scores of civilians might pin the disaster on an AI glitch. The software running the drone itself may have algorithms sourced from various private entities across the world. Who should shoulder the blame in the event of a war crime? The operator, the vendor responsible for software integration or the entity whose algorithm was used or adapted for targeting? Realistically, it should be the antagonist nation but never bet the farm on restitution if the culprit happens to be the United States or a close ally like Israel. Last but not least, governments worldwide acted as co-conspirators in Google’s use of AI to censor dissenting scientific viewpoints and contrarian research findings during the so-called COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, they have effectively handed Big Tech permanent leverage to blackmail them. Furthermore, what do you think facilitates a welter of bioweapons research across 400-odd US military-linked laboratories worldwide? Gain-of-function microbial experimentation is not possible without AI. RT: AI tools in non-military areas of life, such as generation of texts or images, are still far from perfect. Isn’t it a bit early to rely on them in warfare? Dr. Mathew Maavak: The generation of AI texts and images can absolutely be used for warfare, and this is already becoming a significant concern in modern conflict scenarios. AI-generated content can be weaponized via AI-generated texts (propaganda, disinformation etc); AI-generated images/deepfakes (e.g. to subvert national leaderships/consensus); fake intelligence (e.g.create casus belli) and spoofing communications (e.g. subverting chain of command), among others. The possibilities here are simply endless! AI is evolving at an exponential rate. Yesterday’s science fiction is tomorrow’s reality! RT: As reported recently by the Washington Post, Google appears to have been providing AI tools for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since the start of their Gaza campaign. Could the change in the company’s AI principles be linked to that? Dr. Mathew Maavak: I highly doubt it. The IDF’s use of Google’s cloud computing services and related tools (Amazon was teased as an alternative) may arguably be portrayed as the canonical starting point for the weaponization of AI. But why would the IDF want a multinational civilian workforce based in the United States to have access to its military operations? If Google provided AI tools to the IDF, it would have done so under directives from the US deep state. A nominally civilian entity cannot unilaterally supply sensitive AI tools for wartime use to any foreign power, allied or otherwise. Logically speaking, Google’s participation in the Gazan carnage should result in a massive boycott by member states of the Organization of Islamic States (OIC). But this will never happen as too many politicians, “technocrats” and academics in the OIC are beholden to US patronage. (The ongoing USAID scandal is just the tip of the iceberg, revealing the extent of international subversion at play). The rail guards of merit, bias and non-discrimination are also virtually non-existent in the OIC bloc, although they form the pillars of AI governance. All in all, AI principles as they currently stand, whether in civilian or military spheres, are nothing more than a paper tiger. RT: Again concerning the IDF, it has beenrevealed that a lot of the civilian deaths in Gaza were apparently not a result of poor AI tools, but of negligent human oversight. Perhaps military AI, when employed properly, could actually lead to more humane warfare? Dr. Mathew Maavak: Honestly, I don’t think AI had played a significant role in the genocidal war in Gaza. The use of AI would have led to a targeted military campaign; not a mad, blood-stained blunderbuss of terror. This was no “oversight”; this was intentional! Compare Israel’s recent actions in Gaza to the relatively-professional military campaign it conducted in the same area in 2014 – when human intelligence (HUMINT) and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) played a bigger role vis-a-vis AI. Did AI dumb down the IDF or is AI being used as a scapegoat for Israel’s war crimes? The bigger question however is this: Why did the IDF’s AI-coordinated border security system fail to detect Hamas’ military activities in the lead-up to the October 7 2024, cross-border attacks? The system is equipped with multiple sensors and detection tools across land, sea, air, and underground — making the failure even more perplexing. In the final analysis, AI is being weaponized across all facets of human life, including religion, and US Big Tech is leading the way. Ultimately, under certain circumstances in the future, AI may be used to act as the judge, jury and executioner. It may decide who is worthy to live, and who is not. We are indeed living in interesting times. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

Title: Bezos’ Blue Origin Cuts 10% of Jobs to Ramp Up Rocket Launches

Blue Origin is reportedly planning on letting go of approximately 10% of its workforceâabout 1,000 employeesânearly a month after the inaugural liftoff of New Glenn. The company is hoping to focus on growth over the next few years, increasing the production and launch cadence of its new giant rocket. In an email sent to employees on Thursday, Blue Origin CEO David Limp announced the layoffs that will affect “positions in engineering, (research and development), and program/project management and thinning out our layers of management,â according to a copy of the email obtained by CNN. After years of delays, Blue Origin finally debuted its New Glenn rocket on January 16. The heavy-lift launch vehicle blasted off from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, marking the first time a Blue Origin rocket reached orbit (the companyâs New Shepard rocket, used for space tourism purposes, is suborbital). New Glenn’s second stage reached its target orbit following a pair of successful burns of the BE-3U engines, while its booster was lost during descent. The company was hoping to carry out a soft landing of the booster on an ocean-based platform, but alas, that didn’t happen. Still, the rocket’s inaugural flight was a major success. During an all-hands call on Thursday, Limp argued that the company’s decision to let go of more than 1,000 employees would help Blue Origin scale the manufacturing of New Glenn and increase its launch cadence, Reuters reported. The rocket could pose some serious competition for SpaceX, further fueling the rivalry between Blue Origin’s founder Jeff Bezos and SpaceX’s Elon Musk. New Glenn is a partially reusable, heavy-lift rocket capable of lifting 45 metric tons to low Earth orbit and 13 metric tons to geostationary transfer orbit. The 313-foot-tall (95-meter) rocket has a reusable first stage, powered by seven methane-burning BE-4 engines. By comparison, SpaceXâs Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable, heavy-lift rocket capable of carrying 63 metric tons to low Earth orbit and 26 metric tons to geostationary orbit. SpaceX has been an industry favorite for years, while Bezos’ Blue Origin finally got it together last year under new leadership. The company replaced Bob Smith as CEO, hiring former Amazon executive LimpÂ as his replacement. Blue Origin employees, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said that Limp has been tasked with streamlining the company’s business units and pushing for greater focus on New Glenn, providing an overall sense of urgency after years of stagnation. Limp’s push for speed, however, has affected morale and company culture, Blue Origin employees told Reuters. It’s good to see the company making progress on its space ambition, but that, unfortunately, seems to have come at a price. blue originJeff Bezosnew glenn Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: TikTok isn’t out of the woods yet

Employees are on edge about layoffs and a deal still has to happen. Also: Google execs dodge questions, and a tough week inside Meta. Employees are on edge about layoffs and a deal still has to happen. Also: Google execs dodge questions, and a tough week inside Meta. by Alex Heath Happy Valentine’s Day. I’m sending this from the NBA All-Star Technology Summit in San Francisco, where I’ve never seen so many major streaming competitors onstage at once. This week, I go inside TikTok, Google, and Meta. Keep reading for what Elon Musk really wants with his bid for OpenAI… On Wednesday night, ByteDance employees tuned in to their company all-hands meeting with senior leaders from across the company, including TikTok chief Shou Chew. The elephant in the room was, of course, the fate of the app in the United States. During the meeting, Chew said, “We remain confident that we can make a lot of progress to stabilize the situation hopefully soon,” according to a transcript of his remarks I’ve seen. The next day, Apple and Google suddenly returned TikTok to their US app stores after receiving private, written assurance from newly confirmed Attorney General Pam Bondi that they wouldn’t be fined for breaking the law. (Bondi’s letter has yet to be made public, and all parties involved are refusing to comment on it.) During the all-hands meeting, Chew alluded to the years of political miscalculations that led TikTok to this point. “With this road to trust building, if you look back over the years, we actually have made a lot of progress,” said Chew. “Even though the road has been a little bit too steep and windy, we’ve gotten stronger and we’ve survived.” He assured employees that TikTok’s advertising business had stabilized since the brief period when the app was completely offline in the US and that the company is exceeding its user engagement goal. The US is not TikTok’s top market by users or revenue, but it’s by far the most influential. As the weeks went on without the app being in US stores, TikTok’s leaders quietly mounted a pressure campaign around the issue. Key execs, including policy chief Michael Beckerman, held off-the-record Q&A sessions with TikTok creators in recent days to stress that Apple and Google have the legal assurances they need to host the app and not face earth-shattering fines, according to creators who attended the Zoom calls. (Some who attended these closed-door sessions have posted this takeaway publicly.) In these Q&As, TikTok’s representatives acknowledged that the app was suffering from glitches due to some US service providers still not working with the company. “They explained that there was some kind of issue reloading coins, which are used to send creators gifts,” one creator who attended a Q&A session told me. “Live content and coin purchases in-app are affected,” another recalled TikTok’s leaders saying. It’s unclear if these kinds of glitches are fixed now that Apple and Google are hosting the app again. While I’m sure that some TikTok employees are celebrating its return to app stores, the app’s fate is far from certain. President Donald Trump and China still have to work out a deal that could see TikTok become at least partially owned by some kind of US sovereign wealth fund. Trump has made clear that he has the leverage and wants to use TikTok as a bargaining chip with China. In the US, TikTok is not in control of its destiny. Many TikTok employees are also buzzing about the ominous warning Chew gave during the all-hands meeting about future layoffs. “We just have to make sure that the organization is in the right shape at this point in time,” he said, adding that “certain teams” had become “bloated” and “clunky.” “I think we can remove a lot of this overlap of roles and responsibilities,” he continued, “And through that, we can probably offer better job security for everyone because then your work actually has real value and you’re not just part of a meaningless process.” Google’s semi-regular “TGIF” all-hands meetings have been heavily scripted for quite some time. Even still, employees attended this week’s TGIF hoping to better understand why the company is ending its DEI programs and starting to allow its AI to be used for weapons. On the topic of DEI, CEO Sundar Pichai had nothing revelatory to say. “We’ve always deeply cared about hiring the best people around the world and creating opportunities for all,” he said while dialed in from Paris, according to multiple employees who attended the meeting. “Our values are enduring but we have to comply with legal directions depending on how they evolve.” After stressing that Google’s employee resource groups aren’t going away, Melonie Parker, Google’s former head of diversity, who (like her counterpart at Meta) has had her title changed to head of “engagement,” again cited the company’s status as a “federal contractor” as contributing to the changes. She said Google will “depreciate a number of our training programs that are focused on DEI” and update others to remove related language. Google’s top lawyer, Kent Walker, somehow managed to say even less when answering employee questions about the decision to quietly remove the company’s public commitment to keep its AI out of weapons. He said it was good for society for Google to be in the mix on these kinds of government contracts and suggested the company still had red lines for how its technology could be used but didn’t spell them out. It’s not just military applications of AI that Google employees have taken issue with. I’m told that some complained about how Google has been using AI to aggregate and summarize pre-submitted employee questions in these TGIF meetings.

February 14, 2025 13:16 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

Title: Novo Nordisk is facing its worst week this year — after that Hims & Hers Super Bowl ad

Novo Nordisk (NVO) stock took a hit this week, after a Super Bowl ad highlighted a growing challenge to the company’s dominance over the weight-loss industry. The Danish pharma giant, known for its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss medications Ozempic and Wegovy, is on track to have its worst week on Wall Street this year. Novo Nordisk shares have tumbled more than 9%, following an ad during the Super Bowl from the millennial-focused telehealth company Hims & Hers (HIMS), which promoted its off-brand Ozempic. The controversial ad took a surprisingly political tone — with Donald Glover’s “This Is America” as its soundtrack — criticizing the high price tag of branded weight-loss drugs. “Welcome to weight loss in America — a $160 billion industry that feeds on our failure,” said a narrator in the commercial. “There are medications that work — but they are priced for profits, not patients.” The ad briefly featured the company’s GLP-1 injections. The weekly treatment contains compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. In May, Hims & Hers started offering compounded semaglutide injections for just $199 a month — hundreds of dollars cheaper than Ozempic’s nearly $1,000 list price and Wegovy’s $1,349 price tag. GLP-1 drugs are a class of medications that mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. However, due to their high retail price, U.S. patent protections, and skyrocketing demand, many patients have had difficulty getting their hands on these popular medications. When a medication is in shortage, which Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy has been for years, the FDA allows pharmacies to make compounded or altered versions of the drug if they meet specific regulatory requirements. This loophole has led several digital health companies, online pharmacies, and wellness spas to produce and sell cheaper versions of brand-name weight-loss drugs. Novo Nordisk’s executive vice president of U.S. operations, David Moore, told investors on a call last week that the compounded market is having an impact on the company’s demand, and that impact is “growing faster” than anticipated. Novo Nordisk reported, this month, that full-year sales of all its drugs grew 26% to $40.5 billion. However, the company projects that sales growth in 2025 will slow down to between 16% and 24%. Both Novo Nordisk, and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY), have been ramping up production of their GLP-1 medications to remove them from the FDA’s drug shortage list, a goal Eli Lilly achieved late last year. The pharmaceutical giants have also filed petitions with the FDA to have their medications added to a list of drugs deemed too complex to compound safely. Novo Nordisk even took out a newspaper ad this week warning of the risks of taking copycat drugs. This isn’t Novo Nordisk’s only recent setback. In December, the company’s experimental diabetes and weight-loss drug, CagriSema — touted as a potential successor to Ozempic — fell short of expectations. The drug failed to hit the projected 25% average weight loss anticipated by analysts and the company, with patients in a phase 3 trial shedding an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks. The disappointment sent Novo’s stock plunging 20% in a single day. The company’s shares are now down more than 34% over the past year, and it has lost its crown as Europe’s most valuable company to luxury conglamorate LVMH (MC). Meanwhile, Hims & Hers has seen its stock skyrocket nearly 500% in the past year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Faces Securities Class Action After Weight Loss Therapy Trial Data Disappoints, Analyst Questions Trial’s Design – Hagens Berman

February 14, 2025 12:57 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Wisconsin’s investment board saw fit to significantly add to its bitcoin (BTC) bet in the last three months of the year. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) disclosed ownership of just over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of the Dec. 31, per a 13F filing on Friday, up from roughly 2.9 million shares three months prior. The position is valued at $340 million at IBIT's current price of $56.10 and would be worth about $588 million at bitcoin's current price near $98,000. The fund in 2024 became the first of its kind to report a bitcoin ETF purchase, initially buying 94,562 shares of IBIT and some shares of Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which it later sold. The State of Michigan Retirement System later also reported owning shares of bitcoin ETFs, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and two of Grayscale's bitcoin products. SWIB, established in 1951, oversees more than $156 billion in assets including funds from the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) and the State Investment Fund (SIF). The board manages investments on behalf of state employees and other trust funds. Today marks the deadline for institutional investors managing at least $100 million in assets to report quarterly holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The market is closely monitoring these filings to gauge whether large traditional finance firms have been adding bitcoin ETFs to their portfolios since their launch last year. UPDATE (Feb. 14, 18:49 UTC): Updates current valuation of State of Wisconsin's stake in IBIT.

Title: DeepSeek: Everything you need to know about the AI chatbot app | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us DeepSeek has gone viral. Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts — and technologists — to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly? DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions. AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms. In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek. From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies. DeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times. DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice. DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free. DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety. According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’s Llama and “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Equally impressive is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model. Released in January, DeepSeek claims R1 performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks. Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math. There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek’s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they’re subject to benchmarking by China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses “embody core socialist values.” In DeepSeek’s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. If DeepSeek has a business model, it’s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free. The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some experts dispute the figures the company has supplied, however. Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek’s models, which aren’t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek’s models, developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1 that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined. DeepSeek’s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as “upending AI” and “over-hyped.” The company’s success was at least in part responsible for causing Nvidia’s stock price to drop by 18% on Monday, and for eliciting a public response from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Microsoft announced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft’s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said spending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage” for Meta. At the same time, some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entire countries and governments. New York state also banned DeepSeek from being used on government devices. As for what DeepSeek’s future might hold, it’s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to be growing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence.

Title: Meta Shakes Off TikTok Return, Heads for 20th Straight Day of Wall Street Gains

Time Published: 2025-02-14T17:25:22Z
Full Content:
Mark Zuckerberg’s company has seen a 31% surge since the election Even TikTok’s return could not spoil Meta’s long-running party on Wall Street, with the company behind Facebook and Instagram heading towards its 20th straight day of gains on Friday. That easily laps Meta’s previous record of 11 straight days of gains, set back in 2015. Mark Zuckerberg’s company, during early trading on Friday, was up about 8 points, or 1.1% — nothing major, but it would still count as another positive day if those gains hold through the closing bell. TikTok, of course, is one of Meta’s chief competitors, so its return to the Apple and Google app stores on Thursday evening could have potentially spooked Meta investors on Friday morning. And as TheWrap reported this week, TikTok laps Facebook and YouTube when it comes to how much time the average American user spends on the app each day. Still, Meta investors do not appear to be too concerned. Meta has been on a hot streak since Election Day, with its share price increasing 31% to $737.45 per share since then. (The company was seeing a strong 2024 heading into the election as well, it’s worth pointing out.) Those recent gains have pushed Meta to a valuation of $1.86 trillion — making it the sixth most-valuable public company in the world. Zuckerberg, who once kicked Donald Trump off of his platforms, has had a cozier relationship with the president in recent months. He was spotted alongside Tesla boss Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, among other tech executives, at Trump’s inauguration last month — but many MAGA fans told TheWrap they were skeptical of Zuckerberg’s sudden friendship with the president.

Title: Former Marvel exec claims ex-Disney boss denied him promotion because he was ‘another old white guy’: lawsuit
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/media/ex-marvel-exec-robert-steffens-claims-ex-disney-boss-denied-him-promotion-because-he-was-an-old-white-guy/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T17:11:15Z
Full Content:
A former high-ranking Marvel executive claims ex-Disney CEO Bob Chapek refused to give him a promotion because he was just “another old white guy,” according to a blockbuster lawsuit against the media giant. Robert Steffens, who served as chief financial officer and then co-president of Marvel from 2015 to 2023, alleged that then-Marvel CEO Isaac Perlmutter told him in February 2022 that Disney CEO Bob Chapek put the kibosh on his bid for the role of president of Disney consumer products, according to the suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday. Instead, the job was given to a woman of “ambiguous ethnicity” after Perlmutter allegedly told Steffens that the company couldn’t award the position to “another old white guy,” the complaint said. Chapek was ousted later in 2022 after getting the House of Mouse embroiled in a battle with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over the state’s “Don’t Say Gay” law — and replaced by Bob Iger. Steffens’ lawsuit claimed that the “woke” media giant was engaged in an “official effort to promote vice presidents based on their race and a memorandum that would have referred to employees with the racial signifier ‘BIPOC’ [black, indigenous and people of color].” Disney’s actions were “willful, wanton, malicious, intentional, oppressive and despicable and were done in willful and conscious disregard of the rights, welfare and safety of [Steffens],” the lawsuit said. “Our primary focus is on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend our client’s interests,” Steffens attorney Marcella Burke told Fox News Digital on Thursday. Perlmutter was fired by Iger in March 2023. The Disney boss survived a proxy fight last year spearheaded by Perlmutter and activist investor Nelson Peltz. The lawsuit comes as Disney ditches some of its diversity, equity and inclusion policies amid pressure from activist investors and the Trump administration’s crackdown on DEI. On Monday, Disney shut down its “Reimagine Tomorrow” program, which was used to highlight stories and talent from underrepresented communities. The initiative promised 50% of regular and recurring characters across the Disney universe would come from “underrepresented groups.” It also quietly rolled back other DEI programs this week. The Reimagine Tomorrow program sparked outrage in 2022 when a company-wide Zoom call was leaked on social media. At the time, one Disney executive touted her “not at all secret gay agenda,” while another boasted that the company was scrubbing the words “ladies, gentlemen, boys, and girls” at its theme parks to avoid alienating transgender children. President Trump recently ordered an end to DEI in the federal government and for its contractors, which includes many private companies. Meanwhile, companies are also under pressure from conservative critics who say DEI programs are discriminatory against non-minorities. Companies such as Meta and John Deere have rolled back their DEI programs, while others like Apple and Costco have pushed back. Google, GM, Intel, Pepsi, Comcast, Philip Morris and others have softened or deleted their DEI language. The DEI battle is also being fought in the courtroom. Last week, Target was hit with a class-action suit after shareholders alleged the retail giant misled investors about the risks of its DEI initiatives, which led consumers to boycott and its stock price to tank.

Title: Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to Cut 10% of Workforce to Compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/02/14/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-to-cut-10-of-workforce-to-compete-with-elon-musks-spacex/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T17:00:06Z
Full Content:
Blue Origin, the rocket company founded by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, has announced plans to lay off 10 percent of its employees to streamline operations and improve its competitive position against Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The Seattle Times reports that Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp informed employees of the impending layoffs via email, citing the need to reduce bureaucracy and sharpen the company’s focus. The 10 percent cut, which will impact over 1,000 workers across engineering, research and development, and management roles, are part of a broader strategy to scale up manufacturing output and launch frequency. The announcement caught many employees off guard, with some expressing concerns about the loss of institutional knowledge and the ability to meet ambitious goals with a reduced workforce. Blue Origin, which employs between 11,000 and 14,000 people, including more than 4,000 in Washington state, did not provide a breakdown of how the layoffs would affect its various locations. The move comes on the heels of the successful launch of Blue Origin’s New Glenn orbital rocket, a milestone that was seen as a step forward in the company’s efforts to catch up with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. However, the company has faced criticism for its slow pace of progress and bloated structure under previous leadership. Limp, who joined Blue Origin in 2023 after leading Amazon’s devices and services division, has sought to bring a more Amazon-like approach to the company, emphasizing efficiency and rapid growth. This shift in culture has been seen as a departure from the “slow and steady” philosophy embodied by the company’s tortoise mascot and Latin motto, “gradatim ferociter” (step by step, ferociously). Despite the layoffs, Limp expressed optimism about Blue Origin’s future, outlining an ambitious agenda for 2025 that includes landing on the Moon, delivering a record number of engines, and establishing a regular launch cadence for its New Glenn and New Shepard rockets. He also noted that the company would continue to hire in areas that support its goals and customer focus. The layoffs at Blue Origin reflect a broader trend in the aerospace industry, as companies grapple with the challenges of scaling up production and achieving profitability in an increasingly competitive market.

NEW YORK, Feb. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lowey Dannenberg P.C., a preeminent law firm in obtaining redress for consumers and investors, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) for violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired Novo common stock between November 2, 2022 to December 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). On January 24, 2025, a complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its officers, alleging that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo’s projected successful outcome of Novo’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo sought to demonstrate. When investors learned the truth, Novo’s common stock declined precipitously, injuring investors.

Posted on 02/14/2025 8:30:11 AM PST by SeekAndFind Donald Trump was the first president in modern U.S. history to take office without holding a prior public office or serving in the military. This non-traditional path to the White House came with a distinctly corporate approach to economic and fiscal policy, one that both excited and unnerved investors in equal measure.Key PointsTrump’s focus on tax cuts, deregulation, and tariffs boosted domestic industries but disrupted global trade, benefiting sectors like energy, infrastructure, and defense.Rising national debt and aggressive fiscal policies under Trump could fuel short-term market gains but increase long-term risks and volatility.Trump’s pivot toward crypto and rapid-fire policy changes could create opportunities in digital assets and industries favored by his administration.A Business-Oriented White HouseFrom the moment he entered the political arena, Donald Trump presented himself as a businessman whose background in real estate and media would translate into a savvy dealmaking approach in Washington. During his first presidency (2017–2021), that style permeated discussions on tax reform, international trade, and budget negotiations.Trump’s administration sought to pair substantial corporate tax cuts with extensive deregulation to stimulate economic growth. These policies were credited by some for boosting corporate earnings, although detractors questioned whether they would deliver long-term, sustainable gains.Investors observing a potential second Trump presidency, or even the memory of the first, note the lasting influence of Trump’s worldview on business and trade.The belief that renegotiating trade deals and encouraging domestic manufacturing could strengthen the U.S. economy shaped Trump’s policies. For instance, the 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum briefly boosted certain domestic industries but also invited retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners, complicating global supply chains.Future implementations or expansions of such policies under a renewed Trump mandate could create opportunities in industries he deems “strategic,” particularly manufacturing, steel, aluminum, and energy.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, exports of goods and services from the United States reached nearly $2.5 trillion by 2019, but tariff adjustments under the Trump administration reshuffled major trade partnerships.During the late 2010s, manufacturing employment rose by approximately 500,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, partly attributed to Trump’s emphasis on domestic production. Investors who tracked these shifts found that industrial and materials sector ETFs saw fluctuating inflows during the period as markets adjusted to tariff policies.US Debt Levels and Fiscal PrioritiesOne of the least discussed topics during election season was the impact of US debt. When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond.

Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. Trump’s administration sought to pair substantial corporate tax cuts with extensive deregulation to stimulate economic growth. These policies were credited by some for boosting corporate earnings, although detractors questioned whether they would deliver long-term, sustainable gains.Investors observing a potential second Trump presidency, or even the memory of the first, note the lasting influence of Trump’s worldview on business and trade.The belief that renegotiating trade deals and encouraging domestic manufacturing could strengthen the U.S. economy shaped Trump’s policies. For instance, the 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum briefly boosted certain domestic industries but also invited retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners, complicating global supply chains.Future implementations or expansions of such policies under a renewed Trump mandate could create opportunities in industries he deems “strategic,” particularly manufacturing, steel, aluminum, and energy.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, exports of goods and services from the United States reached nearly $2.5 trillion by 2019, but tariff adjustments under the Trump administration reshuffled major trade partnerships.During the late 2010s, manufacturing employment rose by approximately 500,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, partly attributed to Trump’s emphasis on domestic production. Investors who tracked these shifts found that industrial and materials sector ETFs saw fluctuating inflows during the period as markets adjusted to tariff policies.US Debt Levels and Fiscal PrioritiesOne of the least discussed topics during election season was the impact of US debt. When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation.

Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, exports of goods and services from the United States reached nearly $2.5 trillion by 2019, but tariff adjustments under the Trump administration reshuffled major trade partnerships.During the late 2010s, manufacturing employment rose by approximately 500,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, partly attributed to Trump’s emphasis on domestic production. Investors who tracked these shifts found that industrial and materials sector ETFs saw fluctuating inflows during the period as markets adjusted to tariff policies.US Debt Levels and Fiscal PrioritiesOne of the least discussed topics during election season was the impact of US debt. When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow.

U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk.

During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players.

In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk.

Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve.

When Reagan got elected, we entered a recession—as it took some time to get inflation down and the economy growing. After a few years, when his policies took the stock market and the economy boomed. But in 1987, there was a short market crash that no one could really explain. Sometimes groupthink in the markets make no sense. Sometimes groupthink in the markets make no sense. ....policies took effect... But in 1987, there was a short market crash that no one could really explain. ************* I still can’t explain the 1987 crash. The market is historically very expensive now based on PE’s (lagging and forward) so it will take some time for earnings to catch up. It will certainly take some time for Trump’s policies to take hold. I’ve predicted the market will crash, and the media pundits will blame that on Trump and his policies, such as tariffs. *********************** Wall Street will try to blame tariffs, but their support of sanctions because of the Russia Ukraine War, were far more damaging to trade & the international economy. The Federal government collected $77 billion in tariffs in 2024, they might collect $90 billion in 2025. “Big Whoop.” Perhaps the left-wing loonies in the financial sector were hoping to crash the economy to sabotage Reagan; just like they are trying to do with Trump. Food prices are rising every week. Restaurants are even adding a surcharge for each egg ordered. Expect the North Virginia real estate market to take a hit. With 75,000 federal employees accepting a buy out, there could be an unusually large number of homes hitting the market in a fairly short time-frame. Yes there isn’t anywhere else to go. Lots of money chasing overvalued assets RE: Food prices are rising every week. Restaurants are even adding a surcharge for each egg ordered. So, what does that do for the Stock market? No idea. I was just calling attention to some economic data. The S&P went up 100% over the last 4 years. No it didn’t. The markets have been going up for the past 4 years. I guess they can keep going up. Gold is taking a major hit today! My poor portfolio! It’s not feelin’ the love this Valentine’s Day. Kemp and Reagan reluctantly accepted a compromise deal on the tax cuts, phasing them in over 3 years. This was a huge mistake, because businesses held off major capital transactions and investments until the final phase of the cut was in effect. Instead of a supply side stimulus, the economy ground to a halt for three years. Below is a piece of interesting trivia I’m putting here since it is economy-related: “In the 25 days since Trump’s inauguration, CNN has mentioned “egg prices” 45 times. But in the 25 days before the inauguration, CNN NEVER mentioned “egg prices.” Over on MSNBC, in the 25 days since Trump’s inauguration, they mentioned “egg prices” 80 times. But in the 25 days before the inauguration, MSNBC mentioned “egg prices” just 1 time.” They are absolutely SHAMELESS! When the Trump tax cuts are extended in the near future, they need to be made PERMANENT this time!

Title: Johnny O’Sullivan double eases Blackrock past St Michael’s into last four

Johnny O’Sullivan’s double was decisive as defending champions Blackrock College marched into the Leinster Schools Senior Cup semi-final at Energia Park on Friday afternoon with a comfortable win over St Michael’s in a repeat of last year’s decider. Despite the greasy ball, these schools looked to go wide early, trading crossfield kicks and the ambition to play at speed. Rock exposed space on the right, the feet of James Browne doing the trick and clean passing put Paddy Clancy on the ball, but his grubber just eluding the reach of Rhys Keogh. Blackrock narrowed their focus to go through the middle, with tighthead Sam Bishti showing surprising speed to test out St Michael’s centre Charlie McConnell. A knock-on was gratefully accepted by St Michael’s and their maul took them out of trouble and into enemy territory. Bernard White’s drive took him over the top of Cathal Lydon’s tackle where Owen Twomey’s groundwork enabled Ethan Black to strike the lead penalty in the 19th minute. Rock’s decision to keep the ball worked wonderfully, replacement Aiden Vetjens’s late line unlocking the defence to send Johnny O’Sullivan into the right corner for a 5-3 lead in the 19th minute. In a flash, sweet passing put Browne clear down the right where St Michael’s captain Duinn Maguire and Dan Ryan shunted the wing into touch. When the decision was taken to go wide, fullback Ryan was in place to intercept in another example of St Michael’s survival to the half-time whistle. . A sustained St Michael’s attack winkled out a penalty for Black to guarantee a 6-5 edge in the 39th minute, but they strayed offside to offer Paddy Clancy a shot at goal to make 8-6 in Rock’s favour in the 43rd minute. Blackrock struck for their second try after centre White’s hard line exploited a gap at the tail of the lineout. Clancy’s lob was then collected by Vetjens for the try, brilliantly converted by Clancy. Then, Clancy’s delicate ball over the top was collected by Joe Reddan and moved to White for the third try, converted by Clancy to make it 22-6 in the 57th minute. St Michael’s centre Black saw a pass slip forward for White to grab the intercept and Johnny O’Sullivan controlled the ball to speed away to the posts for his second try, which Clancy converted to put the game away. St Michael’s were quick to show character late on, implementing a maul strategy for Cian Walsh to drive over, with Black converting. SCORERS – Blackrock: J O’Sullivan 2 tries; A Vetjens, B White try each; P Clancy pen, 3 cons. St Michael’s: C Walsh try; E Black 2 pens, con.

Title: Elon Musk aims to remake the federal government by breaking it

UPDATED 11:12 EST / FEBRUARY 14 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof This week, it was all Elon, all the time. Let’s see: Musk offers to buy OpenAI (translation: gums up the works for Sam Altman’s attempt to turn OpenAI for-profit, since OpenAI’s board Friday rejected the offer). Makes Trump look like a babysitter for Musk’s four-year-old son prop at a press conference. Tries to cement his government coup via DOGE as judges remind him and Trump we’re (supposed to be) a democracy. Creates a cybersecurity nightmare in the process. Gets a $400 million federal bailout for his failed Cybertruck (for a few seconds). Did I miss anything? It’s now “Do whatever you want” with AI, for better or worse, at least in the U.S., as Biden’s AI rules got nixed and the U.S. refused to sign an international agreement on safe and inclusive AI. Meantime, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman pledges more openness (we’ll see), and news organizations get more aggressive on copyright in a lawsuit against Cohere and note continuing problems with hallucinations. Paul Gillin dug into how venture capitalists view the AI investment environment post-DeepSeek, and guess what? It actually looks way more promising than some doomsayers suggested. AI chips are getting very hot. As OpenAI steamrolls ahead on new models, it’s also close to making AI chip in-house. And Arm is now reportedly looking at designing chips to sell itself, with Meta Platforms the likely first customer. Meanwhile, Intel stock rose more than 20% this week after U.S. pushed TSMC to operate its factories, but it’s far from a done deal. Hardware’s not dead, as HPE, Cisco and Juniper release new gear. Dell also could sell $5 billion worth of AI servers to Musk’s xAI. Oh, and Meta reportedly is about to go deep into robotics. Another big earnings week: Cisco, Supermicro, Confluent, Coinbase and Robinhood beat. Informatica sure didn’t, and its stock fell by a third. Palo Alto Networks fell on a disappointing outlook too. Overall it was a mixed bag — full results below. More cyber consolidation is coming, with Trend Micro on the block and CyberArk acquiring Zilla. You can hear more about this and other news on John Furrier’s and Dave Vellante’s weekly podcast theCUBE Pod, out later today on YouTube. And don’t miss Dave’s weekly deep dive, Breaking Analysis, out early next week. Here’s all the news we could fit from SiliconANGLE and beyond, in another busy week: Venture investors see DeepSeek accelerating AI market growth Consortium led by Elon Musk makes $97.4B offer for OpenAI Late-breaking Friday: OpenAI’s board rejects the bid Sam Altman pledges more openness as OpenAI works toward AGI Paris AI Summit: US, UK refuse to sign agreement on ‘safe’ and ‘inclusive’ AI as JD Vance sends warning Report says companies ‘playing with fire’ as AI chatbots fail when trying to summarize news Major publishers launch copyright lawsuit against AI startup Cohere At Developer Week, Mark Albertson dug into how intense interest in AI agents is colliding with AI security concerns: Building AI with AI: Developers scramble to keep pace with new applications as security concerns grow France announces €109B investment plan to boost AI ecosystem DataRobot buys Aqnostiq to advance AI agent development with dynamic compute orchestration Meta considers acquisition of Korean AI chip startup FuriosaAI (per Forbes) Tines nabs $125M for its AI-powered workflow automation platform Harrison.ai raises $112M for its AI medical diagnosis tools Legal AI startup Eudia launches with $105M to bring AI agents to legal teams Sardine raises $70M to expand AI risk platform Latent Labs raises $50M to develop new proteins with AI SpotDraft raises $54M to help legal teams manage contracts with AI Integrail raises $10M in seed funding for no-code agentic AI delivery platform OpenAI to launch GPT-5 in a matter of months, GPT-4.5 within weeks Workday unveils AI agent workforce management system Snowflake partners with Anthropic to release its first AI agents Baidu to open-source its Ernie large language model series Glean Technologies jumps into no-code agentic AI development with Agentworks Adobe launches commercially safe AI video model for creative professionals Amplitude integrates in-app surveys into its behavioral analysis platform F5 targets AI-era IT challenges with ADC 3.0 reference architectures Zilliz enhances AI cloud offering with enhanced ‘Bring Your Own Cloud’ capabilities Enterprise-sized implementations, bite-sized AI agents at ZohoDay25 There’s even more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Breaking Analysis: Investors cool on cloud but CEOs double down Report: Arm to build its own chips, and Meta is first in line to buy them Intel stock rose more than 20% this week after U.S. pushes TSMC to operate its factories, but it’s far from a done deal.

Title: Garry Ringrose looking forward to challenge of fighting for Irish centre spots

Having signed a new contract with Leinster and Ireland that will take him to the end of the 2027/28 season, Irish centre Garry Ringrose says that his plans are to become an even better player. The 30-year-old, who has won 65 Test caps since making his debut in 2016, establishing himself as an ever-present in Ireland’s midfield, said it was a privilege to stay in Dublin for another three years. Performance Director David Humphreys said at the announcement that he believed Ringrose’s better days were ahead. “That’s always what you’d be trying to aim to do,” said the outside centre. “I’m just delighted and feel privileged to be able to sign on for three years. It’s an unbelievable opportunity to work with some amazing coaches and then players that are keen to get better and improve. I’d be the same as that so massive opportunities ahead.” The competition for starting places in the Irish midfield with Bundee Aki, Robbie Henshaw, Ringrose and others has forced management into some rotation of the players with Ringrose having to be content with a starting from the bench against Scotland last weekend. “I think certainly as centres we’d be pretty open and relaxed amongst each other,” he said. “Over the last couple of years, we’ve all been challenged to play on any given week, either it’s rotation, injury, form, and what’s brilliant is it’s really competitive in training but then at the end of the day, certainly as a centre group, we just want to do our best to help the team win. “I don’t know if you ask myself, Bundee or Robbie at the moment that are rotating, and there’s a few guys that haven’t been in yet. That would be their answer as well. We’re all kind of on the same page from that perspective.” The former Blackrock College player was pleased with Ireland’s haul of 10 points from two matches against England and Scotland with Wales in Cardiff the team’s third challenge of the championship next weekend. “I mean to come away with 10 points from the first two games, we’re delighted from that perspective,” said Ringrose. “What’s been great is there’s been loads of good in the games, but then things we’re reviewing and looking back at and trying to get better at so we’re getting the best of both worlds I guess. To have 10 points in such a competitive group of teams, yeah we’re delighted.” Johnny Watterson is a sports writer with The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: How To Safely Spend Your Retirement Savings
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevevernon/2025/02/14/how-to-safely-spend-your-retirement-savings/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
Develop a realistic plan to safely spend your retirement savings Many retirees plan to spend their retirement savings quite frugally, according to a few recent reports and studies. For example, a recent survey report, To Spend or Not to Spend from Blackrock, shares that retirees prefer to keep their assets untouched and that just one in four survey respondents feel they need to spend the principal of their savings in retirement. According to the report, “For most, retirement is not a time to live it up, it is more important to feel financially secure.” Similarly, the 2024 Retirement Confidence Survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute reported that more than one-third of retirees (38%) have a savings mindset, meaning they want to spend less and save for the future. If this mindset continues throughout life, some retirees might end up passing away with a lot of money in the bank, money they might have been able to spend and enjoy while they were alive. The Blackrock study identifies a few potential reasons for this phenomenon, including the possibility that retirees haven’t yet shifted their mindset from accumulating savings for retirement to spending money in retirement, that they’re afraid of outliving their money, or that they have a deep-seated fear they’ll experience a serious financial or health shock. While I don’t intend to chastise pre-retirees and retirees for being frugal, I do want them to know there’s a straightforward strategy they can use to safely spend their retirement savings. Appropriately, the strategy is called the Spend Safely in Retirement Strategy, and it’s based on robust research that I led at the Stanford Center on Longevity, in collaboration with the Society of Actuaries. We systematically analyzed and compared 292 retirement income strategies, using sophisticated analytical techniques. Two key metrics we used were the amount of lifetime retirement income you can expect as well as the amount of savings you can access at any point in time. Using these metrics, the Spend Safely Strategy (for short) compared favorably to the other 291 strategies we analyzed, many of which are much more complex. The Spend Safely Strategy is designed to withstand stock market crashes, and indeed, the financial turmoil caused by pandemic successfully stress-tested the strategy. The Spend Safely Strategy suggests developing sources of retirement income that will last the rest of your life, no matter how long you live. Then, it recommends you limit your monthly and annual spending to the amount of retirement income you expect to receive. To generate sources of lifetime retirement income, follow these three steps: If you want to preserve your retirement savings, the conservative RMD withdrawal rates might appeal to you. The rates are currently under 3% until age 66, under 4% until age 75, and under 5% until age 81. The Spend Safely Strategy is really a decision-making framework. You can customize it meet your own goals and circumstances. For example, you can make adjustments to achieve these goals: You can implement the Spend Safely Strategy in most IRAs or 401(k) plans, with or without the help of a financial advisor. If you work with an advisor, understanding the strategy can help you have an informed discussion with your advisor. The Spend Safely Strategy offers a realistic balance between frugality on the one hand and spending too much money and outliving your savings on the other. It may take some time and effort on your part to build your lifetime retirement income portfolio, but it’s a very good use of your time, considering that you should be planning to enjoy a retirement that lasts for 25 years or more.

Title: How To Find The Best Sector Mutual Funds 1Q25

Concept of mutual fund investment, showing with hands placing coins inside the piggy bank with ... [+] mutual fund sticker. With an ever-growing list of similar-sounding mutual funds to choose from, finding the best is an increasingly difficult task. How can investors change the game to shift the odds in their favor? There are at least 147 different Technology mutual funds and at least 588 mutual funds across eleven sectors. Do investors need 53+ choices on average per sector? How different can the mutual funds be? Those 147 Technology mutual funds are very different from each other. With anywhere from 26 to 317 holdings, many of these Technology mutual funds have drastically different portfolios with differing risk profiles and performance outlooks. The same is true for the mutual funds in any other sector, as each offers a very different mix of good and bad stocks. Consumer Non-cyclicals ranks first for stock selection. Utilities ranks last. I think the large number of sector mutual funds hurts investors more than it helps. Manually conducting a deep analysis for every fund is simply not a realistic option, exposing investors to insufficient analysis and missing profitable opportunities. Analyzing mutual funds, with the proper diligence, is far more difficult than analyzing stocks because it means analyzing all the stocks within each mutual fund. As stated above, there can be as many as 317 stocks or more for one mutual fund. Figure 1 shows the top rated mutual fund for each sector. Figure 1: The Best Mutual Fund in Each Sector Best Sector Mutual Funds 1Q25 * Best mutual funds exclude funds with TNAs less than $100 million for inadequate liquidity Amongst the mutual funds in Figure 1, BlackRock Energy Opportunities Fund (BACIX) ranks first overall, Fidelity Advisor Financials Fund (FIKBX) ranks second, and Fidelity Advisor Consumer Staples Fund (FIJCX) ranks third. Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (HGASX) ranks last. Why do you need to know the holdings of mutual funds before you buy? You need to be sure you do not buy a fund that might blow up. Buying a fund without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances. No matter how cheap, if it holds bad stocks, the mutual fund’s performance will be bad. PERFORMANCE OF FUND’S HOLDINGS – FEES = PERFORMANCE OF FUND BlackRock Energy Opportunities Fund (BACIX) is not only the top-rated Energy mutual fund, but is also the overall top-ranked sector mutual fund out of the 588 sector mutual funds that my firm covers. The worst mutual fund in Figure 1 is Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (HGASX), which gets an Unattractive rating. One would think mutual fund providers could do better for this sector.

Title: The New Dawn Of Tokenization
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/02/14/the-new-dawn-of-tokenization/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T14:30:00Z
Full Content:
Charles Morey, CEO, MobilEyes Inc. In a world where technology is reshaping finance, tokenization emerges as a transformative force, enabling companies to raise capital without sacrificing equity. Through my work with tokenization strategies, I’ve seen its power to unlock non-dilutive IPOs and revolutionize taxation, equity structures and wealth distribution. By turning customers into stakeholders, tokenization is reshaping industries and redefining ownership. As this innovation paves the way for an inclusive financial future, we must address challenges before AI and robotics reshape the job landscape. At its core, tokenization converts real-world assets or rights into digital tokens on a blockchain. Tokens represent ownership or claims on assets, offering unmatched liquidity, transparency and security. Unlike traditional shares or bonds, tokenized assets are programmable for governance, revenue sharing and compliance. Here are some examples of tokenization in action: • Real Estate: Instead of purchasing an entire property, investors can buy fractionalized tokens that represent a share of ownership, earning proportional rental income and capital appreciation. According to ScienceSoft, "By 2030, the global market for tokenized real estate will reach up to $3 trillion and represent 15% of the real estate assets under management." • Art And Collectibles: High-value art and collectibles are being tokenized to allow broader participation by fractionalizing ownership. • Tokenization Of Capital: Companies can monetize future revenues or assets without issuing additional equity, avoiding shareholder dilution. For example, Janus Henderson’s Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund tokenized $11 million, allowing real-time trading and improved liquidity via blockchain. With major firms like BlackRock adopting this approach, tokenization is unlocking new market access, reducing costs and enhancing transparency. Traditionally, an initial public offering (IPO) involves selling shares of a company to the public, diluting existing shareholders' equity. Tokenization enables a new approach: • Tokenized Revenue Streams: Companies can tokenize future revenues to provide liquidity without sacrificing equity, a revolutionary approach that allows startups to preserve founder stakes while attracting long-term investors. The World Economic Forum (via HSBC) predicts that up to 10% of global GDP, or $24 trillion, could be transacted via distributed ledgers by 2027, underscoring tokenization's immense potential. Additionally, firms can tokenize assets like intellectual property, patents or renewable energy credits, creating collateralized growth opportunities and unlocking innovative funding mechanisms. • Tokenized Assets For Collateralized Growth: Firms can tokenize intellectual property, patents or even renewable energy credits to secure funding. Consider a tech startup with exponential growth potential but is wary of diluting its visionary founders’ stakes. By offering tokenized revenue participation rights, the startup can access capital while incentivizing long-term investor engagement. Tokenization combats predatory lending practices that burden startups with high-interest loans. In a press release published last year, the FTC described two separate cases that show how deceptive lending costs small businesses millions of dollars. The FTC settled $59 million in claims against companies exploiting the Paycheck Protection Program. Tokenization provides a fair, transparent alternative. In a different example, the FTC took decisive action against a company operating under the name "Seek Capital," which falsely marketed itself as a provider of business loans. Tokenization does more than reshape fundraising; it redefines taxation and compliance frameworks: • Transparent Taxation: Blockchain technology streamlines tax compliance by enabling real-time, automated tax calculations and reporting, reducing errors and compliance burdens. PwC highlights how blockchain can automate business rules, expedite VAT refunds and enhance audit efficiency, significantly cutting costs. • Tokenized Tax Credits: Industries like renewable energy and agriculture could tokenize tax credits, creating liquid markets for businesses to buy and sell these benefits efficiently. In a tokenized world, opportunities for wealth creation become more equitable and accessible. Tokenized structures can: • Democratize Access To Investments: Tokenization enables everyday investors to access asset classes once limited to the wealthy. According to Boston Consulting Group, tokenized assets under management could reach more than $600 billion by 2030, unlocking opportunities and fostering inclusivity in financial markets. • Enable Crowdsourced Public Goods: Governments could issue tokenized bonds linked to specific infrastructure projects, allowing citizens to invest directly in community improvements. • Empower Underserved Communities: Imagine Native American tribes tokenizing land rights to secure capital while preserving sovereignty. Through tokenization, I aim to create a new paradigm where businesses harness non-dilutive capital solutions and where individuals reap the financial benefits of assets previously beyond their reach. For example: • Pre-IPO High-Yield Accounts: Companies meeting specific tokenization standards could offer high-yield investment accounts that grow in value over five to 10 years, rewarding investors while increasing enterprise value. • Dividend Tokens: Token holders receive dividends linked to crypto or real-world profits, incentivizing long-term participation and stability. • Automated Compliance/Wealth-Building Mechanisms: Smart contracts tied to tokenized revenue streams could manage compliance, automate dividends and even distribute carbon credits. Tokenization’s impact will extend beyond finance into societal transformation: • Public Safety: Systems like my patent-pending MobilEyes platform could tokenize compliance data, creating incentives for transparent law enforcement and real-time public accountability. Research from SoundThinking shows that 42% of Americans believe a lack of transparency harms trust in law enforcement. • Music And Creative Economies: Tokenized royalties could ensure artists are paid instantly and fairly, cutting out intermediaries. The revolution of tokenization is here, and its potential to reshape sectors, industries and individual prosperity is limitless.

Title: Bitcoin's 2024 Return Against Equities

2024 Returns and Volatility Bitcoin fared quite well in 2024 against traditional assets like bonds, gold, real estate, and the equity market as a whole. But how does it compare to individual stocks? This matters for stock pickers, and for framing Bitcoin in terms of other major technological movements in the economy. Bitcoin had an annual 2024 return of 114%. The return and volatility are both much higher than the asset classes of bonds, real estate, gold, and the entire equity market. However, the risk-adjusted winner of 2024 was Palantir (PLTR), which captured a return of 353% and a slightly higher volatility than BTC. MicroStrategy (MSTR) came in close second, finishing out at a return of 338%, but at a much higher volatility. MicroStrategy would have handily beaten PLTR in November when its return YTD was 497%, but MSTR shed much value in the last six weeks of the year from aggressive bitcoin buying, powered by equity dilution. Even Nvidia (NVDA) offered a higher risk and return, with an annual return in 2024 of 187%. The major tech companies (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta) all offered lower risk and lower returns to Bitcoin. You can see that Bitcoin generally sits on the capital market line of risk and return, with MicroStrategy on one end and government bonds (GOVT) on the other. PLTR is an outlier, but so are companies like Tesla, Coinbase, and Marathon, which all offered lower returns and greater risk. Even the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) roughly matched Bitcoin’s return, but it was more volatile. Now, let’s take a look at a broader universe of equities. Let's sample the companies in the S&P 500 above a $10 billion market cap. A random sample of these companies on the risk and return chart looks like: 2024 Returns and Volatility Again, notice the pattern. Some companies have higher returns than Bitcoin in 2024, but also higher risk, like Nvidia and Palantir. Other companies have less return and less risk, like Disney and Nike. Some are strictly worse, with greater risk but lower return, like Tesla and Micron Technology. There was one company in the S&P 500 that offered a better deal than Bitcoin, with lower risk and greater return. To find it, here's a sample of the companies from the S&P 500 without the $10 billion minimal market capitalization threshold: 2024 Returns and Volatility Here you can see that Sea Limited had an annual return of almost 200%, and a volatility just shy of Bitcoin’s. Have you heard of Sea Limited? Neither have I. So, indeed there may be a better investment than Bitcoin in any one year. But the chances of finding this one company among 500 is small. This proves my point that Bitcoin really is an asset class, not just another single investment. And its risk and return should be compared to other asset classes, not just to other single stocks.

Title: What’s Happening With ROKU Stock?

POLAND - 2025/02/01: In this photo illustration, the Roku company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Roku stock surged by approximately 14% in pre-market trading on Friday, bringing its year-to-date gains to over 30%. The increase follows Roku’s stronger-than-expected Q4 2024 results, with total revenue climbing 22% to $1.2 billion. Roku’s platform business revenue, which includes subscription and ad sales on Roku devices, exceeded $1 billion, reflecting a 25% year-over-year increase. Separately, with uncertainty surrounding the company, see What’s Next For U.S. Steel Stock After A Mixed Q4? Roku’s momentum continues to build. The company recently reported that its global streaming TV household count reached 89.8 million by the end of December and surpassed 90 million in early January. This represents an increase from 85.5 million in Q3 and 80 million in Q4 2023, marking a 12.5% year-over-year rise. Roku also revealed that its smart TVs and streaming boxes now reach nearly half of all U.S. broadband households, a positive development for its high-margin platform business. Viewer engagement is increasing as more users shift from traditional television to streaming. In Q4, total streaming hours reached 34 billion, up 18% year-over-year. With its extensive data on user behavior, ad performance, and engagement, Roku has ample room for expansion. Additionally, the company has implemented cost controls, limiting operating expense growth to just 2% year-over-year—well below revenue growth. Workforce and office space reductions in 2024 contributed to this efficiency. Operating profit rose 17% to $512.6 million, while free cash flow for 2024 stood at $203 million. As prior investments in research and product development continue to bear fruit, Roku has significant potential to improve its margins. See a scenario on how Roku stock could reach $200. ROKU stock has experienced volatility over the past four years, with yearly returns fluctuating significantly compared to the S&P 500. The stock delivered returns of -31% in 2021, -82% in 2022, 125% in 2023, and -19% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, a curated selection of 30 stocks, has been considerably less volatile while outperforming the S&P 500 over the same period. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks have historically delivered better risk-adjusted returns, avoiding the extreme fluctuations seen in ROKU stock, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. With ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, including interest rate decisions and global conflicts, will ROKU struggle as it did in 2021, 2022, and 2024, or could it stage a recovery? Separately, after weaker than expected guidance caused a decline, see Is WST Stock Undervalued At $200? Currently, Roku stock trades at approximately 3x the consensus 2025 revenue estimate, significantly below the double-digit multiples seen in 2021. However, the company faces increasing competition for ad revenue from major players such as Netflix, Meta, and Alphabet. We estimate Roku’s fair value at $78 per share, which is below its current market price. We are updating our Roku model to reflect its Q4 earnings.

Title: Elon Musk's X is pulling big-name advertisers back

Happy Valentine's Day! In the spirit of the holiday, here's something you might fall in love with: A new Apple product. Tim Cook teased the launch of something set for next Wednesday. In today's big story, new and old advertisers are coming to X more than two years after Elon Musk's dramatic takeover. What's on deck Markets: Three charts that show Robinhood's incredible rise over the past 12 months. Tech: Meta CTO says employees who think 'everyone has to like' its policy changes should 'quit' and 'consider working elsewhere.' Business: Everything you need to know about new US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. But first, back like they never left. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. After a tumultuous few years, X is pulling advertisers back. The platform formerly known as Twitter has grown its pool of advertisers in recent months, according to an analysis by Business Insider's Lara O'Reilly. Big-name brands like Apple have returned to the platform alongside newcomers. It's a notable turnaround for a company that has, at times, been outwardly hostile to advertisers following Elon Musk's 2022 buyout. X has sued several big advertisers for what it claims was a coordinated ad boycott. To be clear, the turnaround isn't complete. While X enjoyed a 15% year-over-year increase in the number of companies buying ads, its estimated US ad revenue dropped 28% during that same time period, according to research firm MediaRadar. However, X is also leaning on ad tech partners, as Lara has previously reported, which tends to lead to lower prices compared to using an internal sales team. Even if advertisers are cautious about working with X, they might not have many other social media options. Meta's recent policy changes around content moderation were somewhat inspired by X. TikTok's future remains in limbo. And alternatives like Bluesky are still a fraction of the size of X. There's another good data point for X. Banks have seen increased interest from investors in the debt they hold from financing Musk's 2022 deal. Bloomberg reported on Thursday that Morgan Stanley was upping its offering of X debt from $3 billion to $4.74 billion. Big names like Pimco and Citadel have already jumped in, according to The Wall Street Journal. (It's also worth noting that X's stake in xAI, Musk's buzzy AI startup, was also reportedly used to attract potential investors.) Not too long ago, X's debt was basically considered nuclear waste. The seven banks that loaned Musk the $13 billion to buy Twitter were unable to move the loans, leaving it to clog up their balance sheets. Of course, there's another factor that has nothing to do with X's performance enticing advertisers to return and investors to buy its debt: Musk's close ties to President Donald Trump. Doing business with X could keep a company in Musk's good graces. And staying on good terms with the guy who has the ear of the most powerful person in the world certainly isn't a bad thing. US congressmen sound the alarm on 'secret' Apple order from UK. Read their letter. 1. Robinhood's rapid rise. The brokerage's earnings blew past analyst expectations, the latest in an incredible run that's seen its shares up almost 440% over the past year. These three charts show how a surge in newly funded accounts and a crypto boom have helped the app. 2. Want to invest like the world's best? Start here. Every few months, BI takes a look at where top investors are betting at least 20% of their portfolio. Warren Buffett has continued to reduce his position in Apple stocks, while Baupost Group's Seth Klarman has bought up more shares of telecommunications company Liberty Global. Here are nine stocks whales are making big bets on. 3. Betting on China. Druckenmiller protégé Beeneet Kothari of Tekne Capital isn't afraid of investing in China despite President Trump's trade war. A lot of Western capital has already left the country, softening the blow to Chinese stocks, he said. So, where to start? China has been getting a lot of attention lately due to DeepSeek, and robotics is another strength. 1. xAI has been working on a 'DeepSearch' feature, employees say. Data annotators at Elon Musk's AI startup have been working on the project, dubbed "DeepSearch," to train Grok to perform multi-step research projects the same way a human might, two workers said. It could compete with features from rivals OpenAI and Google, but it's unclear what stage the project is at or whether xAI will ultimately release something. 2. "Leave or disagree and commit." That's what Meta's Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth recently told staffers in response to employee concerns over Meta's recent policy changes. The company changed its approach to internal Q&A sessions to limit leaks to the media. In Meta's internal forum, Bosworth said, "if your view is 'everyone has to like all the policies we have and if they don't it is appropriate to leak' then I think you should consider working elsewhere." 3. The Amazon of travel. Airbnb's CEO Brian Chesky said the app should "be one place you go for all of your traveling and living needs," in an earnings call on Thursday. The company plans to invest $200 million to $250 million in launching new businesses and offerings, which it says will be rolled out in May. Its stock price jumped 15% after the announcement in after hours trading. 1. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to call the shots on health policy. The new US health secretary may be known for his skepticism over vaccines — despite denying an anti-vaccine stance in his confirmation hearings — but RFK Jr. will have even more policy issues on his plate. Here's what the appointee could mean for you and your family. 2. Dozens of Office of Personnel Management probationary workers were abruptly fired. Around 60 employees were terminated in a group video call Thursday afternoon and told their work accounts would be deactivated by 3 pm ET, which gave them about 20 minutes. Two employees told BI that union representatives were not present in the meeting. 3. President Trump wants his education secretary pick to "put herself out of a job." Trump hasn't been shy about wanting to shut down the Department of Education. That could have a ripple effect on grants, student loans, outcomes data, and discrimination claims. And if Trump's plan goes through, other agencies may need to bear the burden. Axel Springer CEO talks trade, Trump, AI, and the future of media. 2025 NBA All-Star Weekend begins.

Title: Price Hikes, Enshittification Trigger 700K Customer Losses At Disney+, ESPN+

Culture Now that streaming subscriber growth has slowed, we’ve noted repeatedly how the streaming TV sector is falling into all of the bad habits that ultimately doomed traditional cable TV. That has involved chasing pointless “growth of growth’s sake” megamergers and imposing bottomless price hikes and new annoying restrictions (like equating password sharing with “piracy”) — all while simultaneously cutting corners on product quality in a bid to give Wall Street that sweet, impossible, unlimited quarterly growth it demands. Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ (all now owned by the same company thanks to consolidation) all recently raised prices to access streaming catalogs of deteriorating quality. Some of Disney’s price hikes were as much as 25 percent, hitting ad-based and ad-free versions alike. Customers were quick to complain. So not surprisingly, Disney+ has now seen the first quarterly subscriber loss in the streaming platform’s history, with 700,000 customers cancelling service. ESPN+, ESPN’s streaming service, also saw a 700,000 subscriber loss: “Total paid Disney+ subscriptions currently rest at 124.6 million compared with 125.3 million at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. ESPN+ also saw a loss of 700,000 subscribers, currently at 24.9 million, compared with 25.6 million at the end of last quarter.” Publicly-traded companies can’t just provide a quality, affordable service people like. That’s simply not allowed. They have to provide Wall Street ever-escalating quarterly returns in the pursuit of scale, even if that pursuit proves disastrous. If it’s not possible to achieve those returns through innovation and subscriber growth (which is no longer possible now that the streaming market is saturated), that’s when big companies get in trouble and start creatively nickel-and-diming their user base. Traditional cable TV, of course, went through this exact life cycle. And despite the fact many of those executives have shifted over to streaming, they’ve learned nothing from history or experience because they’re not financially incentivized to learn from experience. They’re incentivized to make stock values climb at any cost, then flee when things get rough; fat executive or investor compensation in hand. Which is to say don’t expect things to change, even if the economy tightens and customers increasingly balk at higher streaming video prices. I’d expect two major trends in streaming over the next few years. One, a significant uptick in pointless, shitty mergers that trigger layoffs, huge debt loads, more price hikes to recoup that debt, and steady product quality erosion (see: the whole AT&T→Time Warner→Discovery mess). Media execs are very excited for the Trump administration to rubber stamp even more problematic consolidation. Two, I suspect companies will work tirelessly to make cancelling streaming services (a major advantage over traditional bloated cable TV) more difficult, whether that means complicated wireless/broadband bundling that makes dumping services a confusing hassle (is your Hulu subscription discount tied to your Amazon or wireless bill?), or some creative new restrictions we haven’t seen previously. Filed Under: disney plus, enshittification, espn plus, price hikes, streaming, television, tv, video Companies: disney In terms of entshittification, Disney has made it even worse: the ad-free subscription tier is no longer a guarantee of avoiding ads. If I didn’t know any better, I would say they’re actively trying to get people to pirate their content. TBF, Disney’s only following Amazon in enshittification. I dunno about that. Changing the terms and conditions just so people can’t sue for false advertising is more shitty to me. It sounds bad, and I haven’t reviewed the specific agreements, but many web site agreements require users to hold them harmless and even indemnify them. In other words, if you sued them, you’d be paying their legal bills and any amount the court awarded you. In theory. It’s such an absurd result that it’s hard to believe a court would uphold it; I’m not sure any company’s even tried. My point is, “you can’t sue for false advertising” is actually a much better clause than the usual “you can’t sue for anything ever”. (I found such a clause in the terms of the payment provider my landlord wanted me to sign up with—a company that wanted access to pull money directly from my bank account while offloading all responsibility for their errors onto me. Needless to say, I complained, and I’m using checks again like it’s the 1980s.) In theory. It’s such an absurd result that it’s hard to believe a court would uphold it; I’m not sure any company’s even tried. My point is, “you can’t sue for false advertising” is actually a much better clause than the usual “you can’t sue for anything ever”. Oh, no worries, Disney covered that as well. People really need to start treating this shit as they’d treat actual contracts. If Disney handed guests a binder of legalese to sign before being let into the park, well, the lawyers would be happy, because their kids would be walking right onto otherwise-deserted rides. But the company would probably have to backtrack pretty quickly, just as Walmart would if they made everyone sign the printed walmart.com agreement and its ancillary policies before entering a store. Somehow, if it’s online, people will be eager to agree to literally almost anything. I find that people sign paper contracts in person that are also onerous and stupid because society has forced them to turn off their brains and has forced them to blow exorbitant amounts of cash they don’t have on things they wouldn’t need if they wern’t structured to force these needs. Then there are also those who sign just cuz they want stuff, which is also frequently a social disease. So, should it be called “endisneyfication”? That was already a thing, but you can roll all the stupid Disney behaviors up in that coinage. [I]s your Hulu subscription discount tied to your Amazon or wireless bill? They almost got me with the last one until I read the fine print. So Disney+ lost 700k customers. On a total of over 150 million subscribers, that’s less than half a percent. I imagine their departure was more than made up for with the price hike for the remaining customers. I guess the beancounters are striving for a balance between raising prices fast enough to appease the stock market and slow enough so less customers bail. Anyway, they’re not in this business for the entertainment value or the service to their customers. Hard to say. Even if they’re making the money back from increasing fees, it doesn’t look good to the shareholders that they lost almost 1.5 million subscribers across two platforms. Especially for the ad-based products. If raising prices results in fewer subscriptions but the total profit is up, I can’t see investors having an issue with that. But if raising prices is impacting ad impressions… THAT has a cascade effect. It’s shocking they have that many subscribers given how Usanians keep complaining they can’t even afford food. Subscribe through a burner credit card. Subscribe through a burner credit card. That’s a better answer than simply no longer paying their monthly bills. But I must confess, how does one obtain a ‘burner’ card… without being totally dishonest about one’s identity in the first place? Credit issuers have their own rules about these kinds of things, let alone the laws regarding fraud, etc. My version of a ‘burner’ is where my debit and credit cards are issued by a credit union. At my union, I have the power to designate a black list of companies no longer permitted to lay charges against my card/account. Wherein I am honest and don’t wait for the service provider to cut me off, I simply stop using the service entirely, on my own. My premise is that if they turn me into collections, they’ll have to provide documentation that I never tried to cancel through their ‘official’ channel(s), and that I did indeed use the service and then failed to pay for it. I’ve told more than one collection outfit to get me those proofs, beyond just a simple billing statement, and for sure, it’s never happened. It’s worked so far. N.B. Note that states may have different laws regarding the necessary proof. What I described is what my state requires, your state may be different. I do know that collectors will try to skate around these laws and brute-force you into paying, but hold your ground. Or at the very least, get educated on what your state allows (or requires) a collector to do. I use virtual credit cards. If they won’t let me unsubscribe then I can just cancel the card. It works because the amounts are too small to take you to court, or for a debt collector to put in much effort. But, technically, you’d be on the hook for fees till you canceled, and we don’t know whether a court would accept a “it was too hard to cancel” defense. It’s getting very visible in my bubble. Piracy is flourishing again. Of course these companies will point to piracy as the cause of their losses, no the consequence as it actually is. And they’ll extract huge figures incompatible with their actual self-imposed losses and generally taken from their collective arses. could boycotts also be affecting subs? 700k subscribers lost against 125 million overall, with 24 million on ESPN+ alone, means total subscribers went down 3%, which isn’t nothing. It is directly tied to the price increase from $9.99 to $15. It does feel like the current strategy of all major businesses is to kill themselves, from Reddit and Twitter locking their APIs to Netflix and Disney+ increasing their prices for no good reason. Tesla went from being the cool electric car company to the car people are embarrassed to drive and have to slap bumper stickers on saying they bought it before Elon became a fascist president unelect. Most of Teslas revenue last year was from licensing [https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-crypto-tesla-earnings-stock-elon-musk-trump-accounting-ev-2025-1?op=1](and selling cryptocurrencies), it seems. All that being said, you forgot to call anyone brunchlords, Karl, so this article is bad and you are a monster. I made this account to leave this comment. Thumbs down, unsubscribbled. Disgusting. #dobetterkarl Rough back-of-the-envelope est is ESPN/ABC is locked into ~$4B/yr in sportsball contracts. To make it worse, NBA ratings are down 5% this year. So losing even 700K subscribers is going to leave a mark It does feel like the current strategy of all major businesses is to kill themselves It may feel like it, but is it happening? Are they dying? Certainly Disney isn’t. Video entertainment is an oligopoly, and the copyright monopolists can abuse their position to withhold stuff from any companies who’d want to undercut them. People still refer to permissionless downloading as “piracy” and illegal (which it’s not in most countries), and have a general feeling of “wrongness.” I think it’s too soon to tell with Tesla. It could end up like Enron, but for now its stock price and sales remain high. “Fascist president unelect” might be a selling point for Trump voters who wouldn’t otherwise be interested in electric cars. People still refer to permissionless downloading as “piracy” and illegal (which it’s not in most countries), and have a general feeling of “wrongness.” I’m not sure that’s true. Piracy is a copyright violation almost everywhere. Unless you mean de facto legal, then yeah. I’m not sure that’s true. Piracy is a copyright violation almost everywhere. Uploading copyrighted stuff without permission is usually illegal (though rarely criminal at non-commercial scale). Downloading is usually not, and in fact is sometimes explicitly legal due to copyright levies. they’ve learned nothing from history or experience To be fair, it’s not that they don’t learn. Capitalism dictates that revenue must go up. If they weren’t using the main leverage they have to make the line go up, they’d be replaced. Short of changing the rules of capitalism, there’s no other end than enshittification for such large enterprises. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Will Vanguard action trigger cost-cuts in domestic AMCs too?

The fee reductions are expected to save investors more than $350 million this year alone,” it said in a statement. Lower costs leave more money in investors’ hands and raise their potential returns. Indeed, across the industry, lower-cost funds have historically outperformed higher-cost funds on a net-of-expenses basis, Vanguard reasoned. The average asset-weighted expense ratio would be just 0.07 per cent for Vanguard across its $10 trillion under management — a sliver of the industry average of 0.44 per cent, said a Bloomberg report. It’s going to be a catch-22 situation for its rivals such as Blackrock, Invesco and State Street Corp on whether to follow suit at the cost of their profits. Between 2004 and 2023, the asset-weighted average expense ratio fell from 0.87 per cent to 0.36 per cent, according to Morningstar Inc, that tracks the performance of mutual funds globally. In India, SEBI allows slab-based total expense ratios for various categories of schemes, such as equity, debt, hybrid, and solution-oriented funds. Accordingly, equity funds can charge up to 2.25 per cent, non-equity schemes can charge up to 2 per cent as the base expense ratio. SEBI has been working hard to bring down expense ratio. It, in fact, had suggested calculating TER including brokerage fee and GST on management fee at the asset management company level rather than at the scheme level. “This approach was aimed to provide a more holistic view on expenses incurred by mutual funds,” SEBI had then said. The regulator, however, put this proposal on hold after feedback from MF industry body AMFI. The consultation process is currently going on. As per SEBI study, the industry average TER, including additional expenses charged by the regular plan of different open-ended schemes during the financial year 2021–22, stood at 2 per cent for equity schemes, 0.77 per cent for debt schemes, 1.88 per cent for hybrid schemes, and 0.11 per cent for ETFs. This ratio has further slipped currently. For instance, the TER has slipped to 1.4 per cent in January. According to SEBI, retail investors invested more than 57.18 per cent of their investment in equity schemes and 17.49 per cent in hybrid schemes and the remaining 25.33 per cent in debt schemes, ETFs and other schemes such as index funds, solution oriented schemes, fund of funds, and so on. The AUM of the Indian MF industry has grown from ₹11.81 trillion as on January 31, 2015 to ₹67.25 trillion as on January 31, 2025 more than 5-fold increase in a span of 10 years. According to SPIVA Global (S&P Indices Versus Active), the first half of 2024 proved to be a particularly challenging market environment for active managers across global equity markets, as the outperformance of the very largest companies resulted in a high proportion of index constituents underperforming the benchmark return. In India, 77 per cent of actively managed Indian Equity Large-Cap funds trailed the S&P India LargeMidCap’s total return of 17.4 per cent at the end of June 2024. At 52 per cent, It is relatively better for mid/small-cap funds underperformed the S&P India SmallCap’s and 94 per cent of Indian Composite Bond funds and 74 per cent of Indian Government Bond funds lagged the 5.3 per cent return of the iBoxx ALBI India. However, it is interesting to see, in the current downtrend, how many mid and small-cap schemes have managed to outperform the respective indices. The probability of a greater number of schemes underperforming the indices is higher given the constant selling pressure in that space. In this scenario, lower expense ratio would no doubt enhance the return for the investors. With more and more players such as Jio BlackRock, Capitalmind, Choice International, Cosmea Financial Holdings, Angel One and Unifi Capital entering the AMC space, one could hope for further lowering of cost due to competition and growth in AUM.

Title: High Electric Bills Are the Tip of the Iceberg

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/14/2025 4:53:51 AM PST by MtnClimber U.S. electric rates are going up. In Missouri, Ameren increased residential power bills by 11% less than two years ago, and now it is seeking another 15% increase, per the Public Service Commission (PSC). According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), rate increases were experienced in 43 American states between 2023 and 2024. The EIA also reported record rate increases between 2021 and 2024 projections. In California, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was granted six rate increases in 2024. Local ABC 30 Action News reported that The Utility Reform Network estimated that residents had experienced a $50 average increase to their bill before the last of these increases took effect. In New York City, Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change. BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc. are also the top shareholders of Con Edison, PG&E, and the WEC (Excerpt) Read more at americanthinker.com ...

The EIA also reported record rate increases between 2021 and 2024 projections. In California, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was granted six rate increases in 2024. Local ABC 30 Action News reported that The Utility Reform Network estimated that residents had experienced a $50 average increase to their bill before the last of these increases took effect. In New York City, Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change.

An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change.

In Missouri, Ameren increased residential power bills by 11% less than two years ago, and now it is seeking another 15% increase, per the Public Service Commission (PSC). According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), rate increases were experienced in 43 American states between 2023 and 2024. The EIA also reported record rate increases between 2021 and 2024 projections. In California, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was granted six rate increases in 2024. Local ABC 30 Action News reported that The Utility Reform Network estimated that residents had experienced a $50 average increase to their bill before the last of these increases took effect. In New York City, Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change. BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc. are also the top shareholders of Con Edison, PG&E, and the WEC (Excerpt) Read more at americanthinker.com ...

(Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change.

These globalists are only interested in the revolution, not shareholder value. Rapidly increasing electric rates seem to be a thing in the midwest and near west. I do not understand, we have made our wind investments, kept our power plants open, the grid isnt a fire hazard and have low natural gas prices at the exchange points. If inflation would just take a break the constant rate increases could be rejected, but at this point nobody can say that the power companies are to far ahead of the facts. I’d suggest you provided part of your answer: “we have made our wind investments” Yeah. Oh what a day! Here in Alabama, we are enjoying being on the list I saw on the tube the other day as the 5th highest electric bills in the nation. Wow. Our average bill, we are on the program where we pay the same every month and they adjust our bill every few months based on our usage, has jumped by $75 per month. And we are doing all we can to hold our usage down. The 9 degrees temps we had a couple of weeks ago did not help!! Bama ain’t use to 9 and 12 degree temps. Ave in Jan is usually 53 high and 32 lows. Highs of 31 and lows of 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 22, are NOT usual here. Most electricity is generated by natural gas, and the price has been going up since 2023-4. Regulated utilities are by law entitled to make a “reasonable” profit, in order to continue to function and produce vital services. “Climate change” heating up the globe yet again. I’m not sure what “low” nat gas prices is, either. If NG is going up, then so is electricity. The last administration fought tooth-and-nail to prevent NG capacity to increase. Also, building growth is an issue. All being equal, if demand goes up 11%, so does the price. They’re developing all around me - farm land being turned into houses and I expect that the power companies do nothing to expand capacity and just raise the prices. BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change. BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc. are also the top shareholders of Con Edison, PG&E, and the WEC Energy Group. This is getting ridiculously expensive. At least natural gas works! ping Everything is going as planned. As I see it, most folks with electric power usually got it from a power plant in the vicity. Then along came this solar & windpower. Well, somebody has to recoup the expense of building these thing & I suspect they are especially expensive to build, particularly the wind generators. Of course the solar units must be converted to AC. Extra lines are put in to hook up to these part-time poer units. So now you are paying for one or two Part-time power producing units. Sometimes the STANDARD power plants must be cut back so you don’t have an over-abundance of electruicity. I think this also has it’s own cost in efficiency. So when you add up all the extra power-producing units, there is naturally a higher cost. I think it’s better just going with full-timp power from a standard power plant, be it gas turbine, hydro-electric, or what ever else exists. “Green energy” is not full-time energy. Agreed. Everything is going as planned. *********** In your opinion ... “Who is doing all this planning?” “Under my plan … electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.” - Hussein Obama Yep rates rise just as almost every other thing we use. Cost to provide them is just a part of living on this earth. Also cost of most all products/services/etc rise. Products don’t become available to the consumer without labor hours, equipment, transportant, storage, etc. etc. etc. What will the future be like in 100 years down the road? Not the same as today for sure, but who knows the final outcome? We may be taking a pill or injection for our food/body needs work from home will continue to rise, living in outer space at some point will be common, hell all human, animal bodies, etc may be creamated with the ashes sent into space. Lots will change just as it has since Columbus sailed in 1492. Just got a $600+ bill for January on a seasonal property in SW Virginia. Granted it was a cold month but thermostats are set at the absolute minimum. Our highest bill prior to the last few years was less than half of this. With rates like this it’ll soon be cheaper to repair plumbing than keep minimal heat in the house. .21 cents a kwh and mandates to do away with fuel appliances and switch everything to electric- the whole climate change scam is tied in with electric- mandate that everyone switch to electric, the drive the prices way way up (while citing the reason as “high demand”)!

02/14 update below. This post was originally published on February 13 Bitcoin and ethereum have diverged in recent months, with the bitcoin price soaring as ethereum struggles—helped by U.S. president Donald Trump’s predicted plans for bitcoin. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price is hovering just under $100,000 per bitcoin after coming within touching distance of $110,000 around mid January while ethereum has fallen sharply from its recent December peak as “dangerous” bubble fears emerge. Now, as a Coinbase executive claims Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity may already be known, Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has quietly confirmed its bought around $2 billion of bitcoin and ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Goldman Sachs loaded up on bitcoin and ethereum ETFs in the fourth quarter, increasing its ethereum ETF holdings by 2,000% and growing its bitcoin ETF holding to over $1.5 billion, according to a regulatory filing. The funds bought by Goldman Sachs included BlackRock’s bitcoin and etheruem ETFs, as well as funds controlled by Fidelity and Grayscale. 02/14 update: Crypto prices have climbed over the last 24 hours, with small gains for bitcoin and ethereum being dwarfed by Ripple’s XRP, which has surged 10% after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged filings from crypto asset manager Grayscale to list spot XRP and the memecoin dogecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “While this doesn’t guarantee approval, it begins a process for public feedback,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note. “Grayscale’s XRP ETF, filed in January and amended in February, is now under review with up to a 240-day approval period. The SEC's acknowledgment is seen as a positive shift from its previous stance, as it shows openness to these products.” The race for the next U.S. spot crypto ETF is now between bitcoin offshoot litecoin, ethereum rival solana, XRP and dogecoin, with Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas predicting earlier this month that XRP and dogecoin ETF bids have a 65% and 75% chance of being approved before the end of 2025. BlackRock led a campaign to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, led by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) which now has just over $60 billion in assets under management. However, the importance of Goldman’s bet on bitcoin and ethereum via ETFs has been played down one analyst. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious “This position by Goldman Sachs, similar to many other banks and hedge funds, is not a net long position,” said Coindesk senior analyst James Van Straten. "This is a strategy that reflects the basis trade, also known as the cash and carry trade, balancing potential profits and risks for bitcoin price fluctuations. The ETFs recently had options approved on them so this is most likely directional hedging." Last month, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealed he’s had discussions with sovereign wealth funds about buying bitcoin and predicted such conversations could catapult the bitcoin price to $700,000 per bitcoin. "If everyone adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per bitcoin," Fink, who led the Wall Street rush into bitcoin and crypto last year via a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), told Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

The UK-based bank now holds 2,473,064 shares of IBIT, valued at $131 million as of December 31, as per the Thursday filing. The purchase took place during the fourth quarter, spanning October to December, and coincides with the post-election surge in the Bitcoin price, which is now trading at a price of $97,030.17, up 0.8% over the past day, per CoinGecko data. The filing shows that Barclays’ move follows a trend in institutional adoption of crypto-related products, with banking giants such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan also raking up Bitcoin ETF holdings in recent months. As BTC surged to a record high of $109,000 just before the U.S. presidential inauguration, big players are seized the opportunity to capitalize on the crypto’s rise without directly owning BTC itself. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made it easier for these institutions to get exposure to BTC, while sidestepping some of the volatility and regulatory concerns surrounding direct crypto ownership. Goldman Sachs, for instance, reported a 121% jump in its Bitcoin ETF holdings, bringing its total stake to $1.57 billion. Banking giant JPMorgan recently reported an increase in its BTC fund exposure in its latest filing, which now totals $964,322. In January 2025, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs saw a massive $5 billion in inflows, a trend expected to continue in 2025 with forecasts of over $50 billion in inflows, as per Farside Investors data. BlackRock’s IBIT saw the largest net inflows during January, pulling in $3.2 billion, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $1.3 billion. In January alone, IBIT pulled in $3.2 billion, making it the top-performing Bitcoin ETF of the month, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with nearly $1.3 billion in inflows. Analysts are predicting more gains for BTC in the coming years, with projections suggesting it could reach as high as $200,000 by late 2025. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: AI Companies: 4 PR Strategies You Can’t Afford To Ignore
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesagencycouncil/2025/02/14/ai-companies-4-pr-strategies-you-cant-afford-to-ignore/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T12:30:00Z

Heather Kelly is the CEO of Next PR, an award-winning, full-service public relations firm with offices across the U.S. AI isn’t just having a moment; its meteoric rise is rewriting the rules of innovation. Alongside the enormous market growth that’s expected to reach nearly $3.7 trillion by 2034, there’s been an explosion in AI startups across almost every industry sector. With so much buzz and media attention surrounding the biggest firms, it may seem impossible to distinguish your brand from the top players. The competition for funding, market share and media attention is fierce: How can you best share your mission with your target audience without feeling like your efforts are going unnoticed? The key to building a standout AI brand is prioritizing measurable business outcomes and clear KPIs, such as growing audience reach, boosting your sales pipeline, strengthening partnerships or increasing share of voice. A PR strategy tailored to your company’s goals can help you get there. Here’s where to start: Many consumers are skeptical about the “artificial” part of AI and fear machines will take over the world (or at least their jobs). You need to humanize your organization and your brand to build trust and foster connection. Who are you? What are your values? How does your solution make your customers’ lives easier? Because people want to buy from other humans, not company logos, a strong executive brand-building and thought leadership program can give customers a glimpse into the people behind your brand. This is especially critical for AI brands, allowing executives to explain their intentions behind the innovation and address consumer hesitation directly. In addition to an executive social media presence, podcasts are highly effective in fostering authenticity and humanity. The longer, more conversational format lets leaders show their personality and share their own perspectives. Your audience wants to know you understand their pain points and how your solution addresses them. Most consumers aren’t interested in the intricate technical details behind your product, which is what many genius-level founders quickly default to when asked about their solution. A messaging workshop can help you articulate your solution’s value proposition—how it’s better, faster and easier than your competitors’ tools—in a way that won’t make people’s eyes glaze over. Communicate what truly sets you apart, and never rely on being “first” as a differentiator because, in this industry, that distinction won’t last five minutes. Who cares if you’re the first if the second is better? Focus on value and benefit to the customer. Executives often struggle to articulate their brand’s message concisely and consistently. Messaging workshops and media trainings can help them master this skill. A good rule of thumb is, “Can you explain it to my mom and make it relatable?” (Ping me if you want to practice with her!) Trust is the foundation of any successful business. To maintain it, honesty is nonnegotiable. Overpromising and underdelivering can quickly erode audience confidence. One of the biggest mistakes I’ve seen companies such as Tesla and many crypto firms make is hyping up some incredible new breakthrough and then failing to deliver, causing their stock price and brand trust to plummet. Then, there’s the disaster at Meta over AI Facebook and Instagram accounts. This kind of mess harms not only your brand’s image but also consumers’ general perception of AI. The problem is even worse when brands don’t trust their PR team and keep them in the dark about delays or other potential crises until the 11th hour. By then, it’s too late for the team to do proactive damage control. Instead, be upfront, transparent and walk the walk to build trust with customers, partners and the media. If you miss a delivery deadline, give advance notice. If you’re using AI bots, be clear around the intention behind them and you might win favor for the novelty and accuracy of the experience. Don’t wait for the news to break and then sheepishly ask for forgiveness. Repetition and consistency are key to any brand strategy, helping grow recognition and awareness by keeping your people, products or brand in front of your target audience. Speaking engagements and award programs are among the best ways to nurture credibility and trust. Winning an award tells potential customers that your company and products are legit; it’s like a stamp of approval from the experts. Similarly, having your executives speak at events shows them as reliable and reputable industry sources, while also putting a face to your brand. Influencer marketing and analyst relations can be especially valuable for building credibility through third-party validation. These industry experts understand your market, and when analysts communicate your mission and differentiators to their audience, they can significantly influence buyer decisions. While AI may seem like a steep learning curve for many industries and as media channels continue to evolve, the core principles of brand building remain the same. This is no different than the emergence of past innovations: the internet, Big Data, online banking or mobile payments—technologies that once sparked hesitation but are now part of everyday life. You don’t need a PR team that specializes in AI. You need one that understands how to craft the right message, deliver it to the right audience and drive business results. No matter what bright, shiny thing comes along next, a PR strategy rooted in authenticity, clear differentiators, trust and credibility will always stand the test of time. Forbes Agency Council is an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies. Do I qualify?

Title: Morgan Stanley Research: With $16 Billion In R&D Spending This Year Alone, NVIDIA “Can Maintain A 4–5‑year Development Cycle By Running Three Design Teams Sequentially — Each With An 18–24‑Month Architectural Cadence”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Custom AI-focused ASICs are increasingly being billed as NVIDIA's Achilles heel, capable of bringing down the entire demand-related edifice that NVIDIA has painstakingly built by leveraging its strength in the GPU arena. Yet, Morgan Stanley Research now thinks that ASICs pose no threat to NVIDIA's broader success story. Morgan Stanley: Despite ASICs, Nvidia will continue to maintain a dominant market share. The ASIC category is neither superior nor inferior to commercial GPUs—it is simply another means to achieve the same result. Over the past six months, momentum in the AI sector has clearly… — Jukanlosreve (@Jukanlosreve) February 14, 2025 To wit, Morgan Stanley Research has now penned an exhaustive note on the evolving GPU vs. ASIC paradigm, arguing that NVIDIA faces no material threat to its dominant position in the market. The research arm of the Wall Street titan concedes at the outset that "momentum in the AI sector has clearly shifted toward custom silicon," and so has the market, with NVIDIA currently commanding a ~$3 trillion market capitalization on the back of $32 billion in quarterly revenues, while Broadcom (AVGO) now supports a $1.1 trillion market cap on just $3.2 billion in quarterly revenues. Morgan Stanley Research then notes that the development budget of a given ASIC is generally less than $1 billion, and often much lower. In contrast, NVIDIA spends an insane amount of money to deliver an immaculate product: "... NVIDIA will invest approximately $16 billion in R&D this year alone. With that funding, NVIDIA can maintain a 4–5‑year development cycle by running three design teams sequentially—each with an 18–24‑month architectural cadence—delivering innovation over a five‑year span. In addition, they invest billions in interconnect technologies to boost rack‑scale and cluster‑scale performance..." Of course, custom ASIC's such as Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) are much more customizable. However, Morgan Stanley argues that the "largest AI training and inference clusters are not currently highly customized," and NVIDIA continues to optimize its GPUs for transformer models. Going forward, Morgan Stanley thinks that the greatest utility for highly customized ASICs will lie in "legacy workloads." Yet, some might argue that the cost factor is the biggest draw for customized ASICs, which can cost as little as $3,000 while NVIDIA's H100 is priced at $20,000. Here though, Morgan Stanley argues that there are hidden costs that should be taken into account. For instance, the cluster cost for ASICs is often materially higher as they employ the much more expensive optical connect technology, while NVIDIA's 72‑GPU NVLINK domain leverages the much cheaper copper-based technology. Moreover, with its unmatched buying power, NVIDIA can easily secure preferential rates for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. The Wall Street titan goes on to note: "The same applies to CoWoS; because many ASICs use smaller dies with larger stacks, the CoWoS cost can be higher than that of NVIDIA. Of course, NVIDIA’s wafer costs might be higher due to reticle‑limited dies, but overall, Nvidia delivers exceptional value." Next, Morgan Stanley argues that 'software developer hours' should also be incorporated in the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for ASICs, where NVIDIA's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) SDK is at a distinct advantage and provides for a much more efficient software development experience. Morgan Stanley then goes on to assert that "NVIDIA and AMD will outperform ASIC competitors [this year] — especially in the second half of the year." "The scale of AMD’s investments across the ecosystem tends to far exceed that of ASIC vendors. This year, AMD has completed two acquisitions of AI software assets. One of these—the acquisition of ZT Systems—involved acquiring a major server ODM, divesting the ODM business while retaining key engineering talent related to rack‑ and cluster‑scale computing. Once in possession of such assets, AMD can deploy them across multiple cloud environments, which drives third‑party support and accelerates ecosystem development. Can ASIC designers within the cloud replicate this?" Next, Morgan Stanley Research notes that in 2024, commercial silicon controlled 90 percent of the market, led by NVIDIA's $98 billion in chip-based revenue (on a provisional basis since the GPU manufacturer has yet to announce its earnings for the last quarter) and trailed by AMD at $5 billion. In contrast, custom ASICs controlled only 10 percent of the market in 2024, led by Broadcom with $8 billion in revenue, and trailed by Alchip and Marvel whose combined revenue amounted to only ~$2 billion. In what is a critical prediction, Morgan Stanley then declares: "We expect the 90% share for commercial products to increase slightly this year." To bolster this prediction, the Wall Street behemoth notes that Broadcom is overly reliant on Google's TPU to drive sales. Yet, in 2025, NVIDIA "will grow 50 – 100% more than TPU." Similarly, Marvel is increasingly reliant on Amazon's Trainium ASIC. While Amazon is all set to double its ASIC purchases to ~$4 billion this year, it is also expected to "more than double" its purchases from NVIDIA. Therefore, Morgan Stanley thinks that NVIDIA's "revenue momentum in the second half [of 2025] will be significantly stronger than the builds from ASIC or AMD." Beyond 2026, ASIC growth can explode, with Broadcom's own SAM analysis predicting that "Google, Meta, and Bytedance could each achieve between $60 billion and $90 billion in revenue in the 2027 fiscal year with clusters numbering in the millions." Nonetheless, Morgan Stanley thinks that "the total addressable market (TAM) for AI ASICs would grow from $12 billion in 2024 to $30 billion in 2027—a figure considerably lower than what is being discounted in the market now." Towards the end, the investment bank notes: "NVIDIA's biggest short‑term risk is U.S. export controls, which are equally problematic for AVGO. In the long term, the greatest risk is not competition but a slowdown in investment— which we forecast to occur around mid‑2026." Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Markets Shrug Off More Tariff Talk; Meta Platforms Improbable Run

Shares of DraftKings are indicated higher in premarket following a bullish outlook issued by the ... [+] company. (Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images) Key Takeaways Stocks posted their best day of the week on Thursday. The S&P 500, Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all posted gains of right around 1%. Meantime, the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.5%. The run came despite a higher-than-expected uptick in the Core Producer Price Index (PPI) and more tariff talk. Concerns about inflation began heating up on Wednesday following a Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showing prices ticking higher. Yesterday's PPI confirmed inflation was moving higher but perhaps not to the extend many feared from the CPI read. Still, the reports have put inflation back on the table and that will likely result in added emphasis placed on both future economic data and what members of the Fed say at any speaking engagement. I think next Wednesday, when the Fed releases the minutes from their last meeting, there will be a lot of tea leaves reading. Tangentially related to inflation, on Thursday, President Trump said he plans to put in place reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. goods. That threat is being seen as taking aim at India and the European Union among others. The specifics of the tariffs are not yet known but are expected to be announced next Tuesday. One of the things we’ve seen since the new administration took over is a return to policy by tweet. What I mean by that is simply, President Trump often makes announcements via social media and will do so without forewarning. That has sometimes meant policy announcements over the weekend and investors may want to be more conscience of that risk on Fridays. Turning to earnings, after the close on Thursday both Coinbase and DraftKings announced results. For Coinbase, it was the strongest quarter for revenue in three years as the company beat on both the top and bottom lines. Shares of Coinbase were up 8% on Thursday but are indicated to open down just under 1%. DraftKings also reported their results. While the online betting company missed on both the top and bottom lines, they did report a 36% increase in monthly unique payers for the quarter. They also raised their guidance for 2025. Shares of DraftKings were up 2% Thursday and are trading higher by 5% in premarket. Finally, Applied Materials released their earnings this morning. While the company beat on both the top and bottom line, they offered an outlook below what analysts expected. Shares of Applied Materials are lower by nearly 10% in premarket trading. One stock that did not report earnings but has been on an incredible run of late is Meta Platforms. That company has seen its shares rise for seventeen consecutive days. The probability of this happening for those that are curious is 0.0000076. If you are someone who has enjoyed the ride and decided you might want to take profits or at least protect them, I don't think anyone would blame you in light of the probability of what has been happening. For today, I am keeping an eye on Meta Platforms for the reason I mentioned above. I'm also watching gold. Despite the strength in the market and its ability to seemingly shrug off anything, gold is trading at all-time highs and that may serve as the proverbial canary in the coal mine with respect to a reemergence of inflation and what it could mean for equities. This is also a three-day weekend with Monday being President's Day and therefore, because of the nature in which policy decisions are being announced, I would not be surprised if we see some selling near the close today. I also wouldn't be surprised if, while watching television this weekend, we see a ton of commercials for mattress sales because somewhere along the line, we decided it can't be an American holiday without mattresses going on sale.

Title: Why ageless BlackRock boss Larry Fink has no plans to retire
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/business/why-ageless-blackrock-boss-larry-fink-has-no-plans-to-retire/

One of the big questions on Wall Street is when Larry Fink, the long-time CEO and founder of money-management behemoth BlackRock, will decide to retire. The answer: Never, if Fink has his way. The CEO of the world’s largest asset-management firm has alerted his top people that he is sticking around for the foreseeable future, at least until BlackRock absorbs some $28 billion in new acquisitions it made in the past year or so intended to expand its footprint beyond plain-vanilla investing on behalf of clients, On The Money has learned. Fink’s plan to remain in his job without a clear retirement date is why one potential successor, Mark Wiedman, the managing director of the firm’s global client business, announced last month that he is leaving after around 20 years at the firm. Wiedman is 54, and Fink is a very healthy 72, or as one BlackRock insider told On The Money, “Larry has the energy of a 27-year-old, and he’s having the time of his life.” A company flack tells me succession planning is always being discussed by the BlackRock board, but if you know anything about this company, it’s Fink’s baby, and they report to him. He started BlackRock in 1988, after being jettisoned from the old First Boston Corp., following some significant trading desk losses. The firm was first an asset-management subsidiary of the Blackstone Group, one of the pioneers of private equity created by Stephen Schwarzman and Pete Peterson. By 1992, Fink’s baby was growing exponentially (as was his ego that brushed up against the sizable one of Schwarzman’s), so much so that he bought himself out of Blackstone for a mere $300 million. Today, BlackRock has a market value of $150 billion and manages $11.6 trillion in assets. When asked about letting Fink and BlackRock go, Schwarzman once quipped that it was “the biggest mistake” he’s made as a CEO. Another reason it was a mistake for Schwarzman to let Fink go is that they are — thanks to those acquisitions — increasingly direct competitors, a little known fact on Wall Street except in the offices of both places. Blackstone is the king of the private equity business, with $1.1 trillion in assets taken private that will at some point be sold. BlackRock has been mainly a manager of other people’s assets, a so-called passive investment adviser that sells stuff like exchange traded funds and advises public pension funds here and abroad. But there is a BlackRock-Blackstone war going down, with the former encroaching on the latter’s turf. Last year, BlackRock bought private credit firm HP Partners, which provides loans to businesses. BlackRock now has two PE platforms, and it offers banking services to general partners of private equity outfits. It has teamed with PE firm Partners Group to offer investors access to this lucrative market. I know what you’re saying, isn’t Larry Fink “Mr. ESG,” the acronym for the controversial, and woke Environmental Social Governance investing? He was. Little secret: ESG makes up a $1 trillion of BlackRock’s $11 trillion in AUM, and much of it comes from overseas investors. Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Fink used to talk up ESG. No longer after he took a lot of grief from Red State pols, including those who run pension funds in places like Texas and Florida, he has since been downplaying ESG here in the US. That combined with some savvy lobbying from his government affairs team has quelled a lot of the Red State anger. Not being a target of conservative scorn has its benefits: Fink is focused on the business. Earnings are up, as is his AUM, as On The Money previously reported He’s expanding into crypto ETFs and increasingly, competing against his old pal, Schwarzman. And he doesn’t want to retire, because as an associate told me, “he’s having too much fun.” Advertisement

Title: Different Ways to Invest in Gold Explained

Gold IRA February 14, 2025 We research all the brands mentioned and may receive a fee from our partners. Research and financial concerns may impact how brands are presented. Not every brand is included. Learn more. Let’s not waste any time. I’ll be covering the different ways you can invest in gold. As an American, you have several options for investing in gold, depending on your goals, risk tolerance, and whether you prefer physical or paper gold. Here are the main ways you can invest. But first: Looking to protect your investments from inflation? Diversify your portfolio with a Gold IRA. Secure your assets by investing in gold coins, bars, and bullion. Starting is simple – click on your state now and take the first step toward a more secure financial future! Look, if you’re investing in gold, you’re doing it because you understand one fundamental truth: paper money is a joke. The government prints it like Monopoly cash, inflation robs you blind, and the banking system? A house of cards waiting to collapse. You want something real, something tangible—gold. Bullion is just a fancy word for gold bars and coins, and this is where serious investors park their money. Why? Because bullion holds its value when everything else crumbles. What’s the catch? Great, you’ve got some gold. Now what? You can’t just stuff it in a sock drawer and hope for the best. Step one: don’t be an idiot. There are a lot of scammers out there preying on people who don’t do their research. You don’t just sit on gold forever. At some point, you’ll want to cash out. Gold ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are basically the participation trophy of gold investing. You don’t actually own gold—you own a paper representation of gold. It’s like saying you have a pet lion because you watched a National Geographic documentary. But hey, some people don’t want to deal with safes, security, or actually holding real gold. If that’s you, then ETFs are the easiest way to get in on the gold game. A Gold ETF is a fund that tracks the price of gold. You buy shares, and those shares are supposed to represent actual gold that some financial institution (probably one you don’t trust) is holding in a vault somewhere. The most popular ones: The idea is simple: Instead of buying and storing gold yourself, you buy shares in a fund that does it for you. Sounds great, right? Well… not so fast. ✅ Easy to Buy & Sell – Unlike physical gold, you can trade ETFs instantly on the stock market. No haggling with dealers. No waiting for delivery. Just click and you own (sort of) gold.✅ No Storage Hassles – No safes, no vaults, no worrying about someone breaking into your house and making off with your stash.✅ Lower Transaction Costs – No dealer markups, no shipping fees, no getting ripped off by pawn shops when you sell.✅ Can Be Held in an IRA – If you want to hedge your retirement savings with gold, ETFs are an easy way to do it inside a tax-advantaged account. So yeah, ETFs give you exposure to gold without the headaches. But now let’s talk about the ugly side of ETFs—because there’s plenty. 🚩 You Don’t Actually Own Gold – Let’s be crystal clear: Owning a Gold ETF is not the same as owning physical gold. If the system collapses, you’re holding a digital number on a screen, not something you can barter with. If you don’t hold it, you don’t own it. Period. 🚩 Counterparty Risk – When you own gold in your hands, you don’t have to trust anyone. With an ETF, you’re trusting banks, fund managers, and custodians—aka, the same people who mismanage money, rig markets, and gamble with your savings. If something goes wrong, guess who gets left holding the bag? (Hint: It’s not them.) 🚩 Redemption Is a Joke – Most Gold ETFs do not let you redeem your shares for actual gold. That means even if the fund does hold physical gold (which you’re just taking their word for), you’ll never see a single ounce of it. Instead, when you sell, you get paid in cash—which, again, is just paper money. 🚩 Fees Eat Into Your Gains – GLD charges an expense ratio of about 0.40% per year. Doesn’t sound like much, but over time, that adds up. And unlike physical gold, which just sits there gaining value, ETFs bleed a little money every year just for existing. 🚩 Government Control – Here’s a fun fact: The government can freeze your brokerage account anytime it wants. Think it can’t happen? Ask the Canadians who had their bank accounts locked for donating to the trucker protests. If things get bad enough, your Gold ETF won’t save you. Look, I’ll be fair—Gold ETFs aren’t useless. They’re a decent option if you:✅ Just want short-term exposure to gold prices without dealing with physical storage.✅ Are a trader looking to capitalize on gold price movements.✅ Want a gold hedge inside your stock portfolio. But if you’re investing in gold because you actually care about protecting wealth, hedging against collapse, or securing your financial future, physical gold is the only real option. Gold mutual funds are bundles of investments related to gold, usually a mix of mining stocks, gold ETFs, and sometimes actual gold bullion. You put your money in, and some fund manager—who takes a cut, by the way—decides how to invest it for you. Examples: Why do people buy these? But Here’s the Problem: 🚩 You Don’t Own Gold – Again, you own paper assets linked to gold. When the system breaks down, what good is a mutual fund statement? 🚩 Fees & Middlemen – The fund manager gets paid whether you make money or not. If gold skyrockets, they profit first. 🚩 Stock Market Exposure – These funds are tied to mining companies, which means they rise and fall with the stock market, not just gold prices. If the economy tanks, mining stocks can crash even if gold goes up. 🚩 Government Regulation – The SEC, the IRS, and every other three-letter agency has their hands all over these. If things go south, mutual funds can be frozen, taxed, or “restructured” (a nice way of saying you get screwed). Now, if gold mutual funds are for passive investors, gold futures are for the adrenaline junkies who think betting their savings on short-term gold prices is a good idea. A gold futures contract is a legal agreement to buy or sell gold at a future date at a set price. You don’t have to own gold—you’re just betting on whether the price will go up or down. ✅ Leverage – You control a large amount of gold with a small amount of money.✅ Short-Term Profits – If you time it right, you can make a lot of money fast.✅ Liquidity – Futures are heavily traded, so you can buy and sell quickly. Why Gold Futures Are Insane for Most People: 🚩 Extreme Risk – Gold futures are a zero-sum game. If you win, someone else loses. If you lose, you lose big. Most retail traders get wiped out. 🚩 Margin Calls – If the market moves against you, you have to put up more money. Fast. If you can’t, your position is liquidated, and you’re left with nothing. 🚩 No Physical Gold – Once again, this is just numbers on a screen. If the financial system collapses, do you really think your futures contract is going to protect you? 🚩 Big Players Control the Market – Hedge funds, banks, and institutions dominate the futures market. They have insider knowledge, algorithms, and the ability to manipulate prices. You don’t. If you’re investing in gold because you want real security, neither of these options should be your first choice. Gold Mutual Funds and Gold Futures are just Wall Street’s way of keeping you trapped in their system—where they get their fees and take their cut, while you hold an IOU for gold that you’ll never see. Real gold? That’s what kings, governments, and smart people hold.Paper gold? That’s what they sell to the masses. So ask yourself: Do you want to own gold, or do you want to play Wall Street’s gold games? Alright, let’s talk about Gold IRAs—because if you’re planning for retirement and you don’t have some of your money in gold, you’re doing it wrong. Here’s the reality: The U.S. dollar is a ticking time bomb. The government prints money like a drunk teenager with a credit card, inflation is eating away at your savings, and politicians—both parties—have no interest in fixing the mess. So, what do you do? You put your retirement savings into something that actually holds value. And that’s exactly what a Gold IRA does. A Gold IRA (Individual Retirement Account) is a self-directed IRA that lets you hold physical gold instead of just stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Instead of trusting Wall Street with your future, you invest in something real—gold, silver, and other precious metals. You’re still getting the tax advantages of a regular IRA, but instead of hoping your stocks don’t crash right before retirement, you own actual gold that holds value no matter what happens. ✅ Hedges Against Inflation – While your dollars become worthless, gold keeps its purchasing power. 50 years ago, $35 bought you an ounce of gold. Today, that same ounce is worth nearly $2,000+. That’s how you keep wealth intact. ✅ Protects You from Government Stupidity – If the economy crashes, if banks fail, if another bailout happens (and it will), your 401(k) full of stocks could get wrecked. A Gold IRA keeps your savings in a real asset that politicians can’t just print more of. ✅ Tax-Advantaged Growth – Just like a traditional IRA, you can defer taxes on your gains. With a Roth Gold IRA, you pay taxes now but never again—so when gold skyrockets, your profits are 100% tax-free. ✅ Diversification That Actually Works – Wall Street tells you to “diversify” by buying 30 different stocks… all of which can crash at the same time. Real diversification means owning something outside of the stock market—like gold. ✅ You Own It, Not Some Bank – Unlike Gold ETFs or mining stocks, where you’re trusting paper contracts, a Gold IRA holds physical, tangible gold stored in a secure, IRS-approved depository. It’s yours. No counterparty risk, no Wall Street nonsense. It’s actually easier than you think—and if you already have a 401(k) or IRA, you can roll it over into gold. 1️⃣ Find a Gold IRA Custodian – You need an IRS-approved company to handle the paperwork and store your gold. Good options include: 2️⃣ Fund Your Account – You can roll over an existing IRA or 401(k) tax-free or make new contributions (subject to IRS limits). 3️⃣ Buy Approved Gold & Silver – Not just any gold works—IRS rules say you need to buy specific coins and bars, like: 4️⃣ Secure Storage – The gold is stored in a highly secure, IRS-approved depository. No, you can’t keep it under your mattress (IRS rules), but it’s your gold, sitting in a vault, completely safe. 5️⃣ Watch It Grow – Gold doesn’t pay dividends, but it appreciates in value while the dollar dies. And when you retire? You can either take a cash payout or have the gold shipped directly to you. 🚩 “Gold IRAs have storage and custodian fees!” ▶ Yeah, and so does a regular IRA or 401(k)—you just don’t see the hidden fees you’re paying to Wall Street. At least with a Gold IRA, you’re paying to store something real instead of gambling on stocks. 🚩 “Gold doesn’t generate income like stocks.” ▶ Gold’s job isn’t to pay dividends—it’s to preserve wealth. Stocks rise and fall, but gold holds its value for centuries. 🚩 “What if the government confiscates gold like in 1933?” ▶ If that happens, trust me, the economy is so far gone that nothing will be safe. But Gold IRAs are still a smarter bet than hoping Wall Street takes care of you. Alright, let’s get something straight right now—if you don’t hold the gold in your hands, you don’t own it. Period. End of discussion. And yet, we’ve got this new trend—Digital Gold. It sounds fancy. It sounds modern. But let’s call it what it really is: a digital IOU for gold that you’ll probably never see. Let’s break this down. Digital Gold is a system where you buy fractional ownership of gold stored in a vault somewhere—but instead of getting the actual gold, you get a digital certificate or balance that says you “own” it. Popular platforms include: The idea is simple: Instead of dealing with the “hassle” of storing real gold, you just trust some company to hold it for you while they give you a number on a screen. Sounds familiar? Yeah, that’s because it’s basically a glorified bank account. ✅ Fractional Ownership – You can buy tiny amounts of gold, even a few dollars’ worth, which makes it accessible. ✅ No Storage Hassle – You don’t need a safe, a vault, or a hidden compartment in your house. The gold is “securely stored” for you (so they say). ✅ Fast Transactions – You can buy and sell instantly, unlike physical gold, which takes time to sell and ship. ✅ Can Be Used for Payments – Some digital gold platforms even let you “spend” your gold like cash. Because apparently, gold is too “old-fashioned” now. Alright, sounds nice, right? Yeah, until you realize the entire thing is built on trust. 🚩 YOU DON’T ACTUALLY OWN THE GOLD – Let’s get one thing clear: Digital Gold is not the same as holding physical gold. You’re trusting some company to store it for you, and if they go bankrupt, get hacked, or decide to freeze your account, good luck getting your gold. 🚩 COUNTERPARTY RISK – When you own real gold, you don’t have to trust anyone. When you own digital gold, you’re trusting a company, a vault, and a bunch of middlemen to not screw you over. And if history has taught us anything, middlemen always screw you over. 🚩 WITHDRAWAL RESTRICTIONS – Many digital gold platforms make it incredibly difficult to actually take physical delivery of your gold. There are minimum withdrawal amounts, high fees, and long wait times. In other words, they’ll sell you “gold” all day long, but when you ask for the real thing? Suddenly, there are rules. 🚩 GOVERNMENT CONTROL – What’s stopping the government from regulating or seizing digital gold platforms? Nothing. Your account can be frozen, your assets can be taxed, and suddenly, your “gold-backed” investment isn’t so secure anymore. 🚩 CENTRALIZATION DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF GOLD – The whole point of gold is freedom from the financial system. Digital Gold just locks you back into it. It’s basically a digital fiat currency dressed up as gold. Let’s be real—if the economy crashes tomorrow, Digital Gold is just another number on a screen. You know what people will actually trade? Real, physical gold. Look, I get it. Digital Gold sounds convenient. It’s easy, it’s fast, and it feels like “owning gold” without the “hassle.” But that’s exactly the trap. The whole reason you invest in gold is to get out of the system—not to get trapped in another version of it. If you want to actually protect your wealth, here’s what you do:🚨 BUY REAL GOLD. 🚨 STORE IT YOURSELF. 🚨 DON’T TRUST THIRD PARTIES. It’s that simple. Don’t fall for the Digital Gold illusion. Because when things go south, the only gold that matters is the gold in your hands. If you have zero faith in the U.S. government, the Federal Reserve, or the financial system, congratulations—you’re paying attention. A Gold IRA is one of the smartest ways to protect your retirement from inflation, stock market crashes, and the reckless policies that are destroying the dollar. Gold is real. Gold is lasting. Gold is what nations, billionaires, and smart people invest in when they see economic chaos coming. So the only question left is: Are you protecting your future, or are you gambling it on a system that’s already failing?

Title: Costco and investors could pay big time for its DEI policies
URL: https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/costco-investors-could-pay-big-time-its-dei-policies
Time Published: 2025-02-14T10:00:45Z
Full Content:
Americans from Texas, Michigan and New York react to Costco's refusal to adhere to President Trump's private sector suggestion to band DEI hiring policies. By now, many companies have learned the hard way that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs aren’t the business panacea they were once sold to be. In recent weeks, Google, Amazon, Walmart, Ford, McDonald’s and many other major corporations, facing backlash and declining employee morale, have backtracked from DEI, shifting gears in the face of mounting legal and financial risks. But Costco, against the tide, has doubled down on its DEI initiatives — at the peril of its bottom line, and now, its legal standing. Costco’s DEI program isn’t just a set of lofty ideals. It is embedded in the company’s operations at every level, with a Chief Diversity Officer at the helm and employees dedicated solely to diversity goals. This program informs hiring decisions, with race and gender as key factors in determining who is hired. Moreover, the company favors racial minorities and women-owned businesses when selecting suppliers, and its donations go to controversial activist groups — some of which have been accused of illegal racial discrimination themselves. FORMER COSTCO EXECUTIVE DEFENDS ITS DEI POLICIES, SAYS CRITICS DON'T UNDERSTAND THE COMPANY'S CULTURE In a bid to halt Costco’s DEI trajectory, a shareholder proposal was recently brought forward, urging the company to evaluate the risks associated with its diversity policies. This proposal pointed to the legal case of Starbucks, which was forced to pay a $25 million verdict for a single instance of discrimination against a White employee. While that case involved only one individual, the financial fallout for Costco could be catastrophic. While many companies move away from DEI, Costco continues to stick to its outmoded strategy. FILE: In an aerial view, the Costco logo is displayed on the exterior of a Costco store on July 11, 2024, in Richmond, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) If even a small fraction of Costco’s up to 200,000 non-minority employees decided to sue, the company could face judgments running into tens of billions of dollars. But when confronted with this data, Costco didn’t retreat; instead, the company’s board rejected the proposal and defended its DEI program. The company claimed that its focus on diversity wasn’t just about improving financial outcomes, but about "enhancing our culture and the well-being of people whose lives we influence." CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Despite the risks outlined, the three biggest asset managers — BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street — were complicit with the board in driving Costco’s DEI push. With significant stakes in the company, these investment giants control nearly a fifth of Costco’s shares. Their votes likely provided the critical mass necessary for the proposal’s overwhelming passage. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have continued to champion DEI, even as its legal implications grow clearer. Costco’s blind commitment to DEI is now drawing the attention of legal authorities at the highest levels. In late January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing federal agencies to scrutinize companies that maintain illegal discriminatory practices, including DEI initiatives. Each agency is tasked with identifying companies — such as Costco — that may be violating federal laws prohibiting discrimination. On top of this, a coalition of 19 state attorneys general has stepped up, urging Costco to reevaluate its DEI policies. They argue that Costco’s programs may be in violation of anti-discrimination laws, and the company has just 30 days to comply with their demands or face further legal action. Costco’s decision to dig in its heels on DEI is a bold one and could prove to be disastrous. The mounting legal challenges and the ever-growing body of evidence showing that DEI programs increase workplace hostility and fail to yield the promised business benefits should give pause to anyone still holding out hope for their success. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As more states and federal agencies take a closer look at the legal ramifications of DEI policies, companies like Costco may soon find themselves on the wrong side of the law, facing penalties that far outweigh any short-term cultural benefits. For investors, this should be a wake-up call. Costco’s stock has tripled over the past five years and is sitting at an all-time high. Pushing for divisive, race-based policies could alienate customers and increase legal exposure, impacting the share price. The tide is turning for most firms. Companies across America are waking up to the dangers of DEI. Disney, Target and Anheuser-Busch all saw their stocks plummet after DEI controversies and are trying to make amends. Costco might be next to learn that diversity at the expense of the law and customer preference is a bet that doesn’t pay off.

Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO), a company specializing in networking equipment, security, collaboration, and cloud management services, has seen its stock rise 6% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 index’s 3% growth as of January 12. In contrast, CSCO’s competitor, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), experienced a 3% decline in the same period. Separately, check out: HubSpot Stock At $840 – Is the Price Justified? Cisco’s Q2 earnings for the period ending January 25, released on February 12, surpassed analyst expectations on both revenue and profit. The company reported $14 billion in revenue, marking a 9% year-over-year (y-o-y) increase. This performance ended a four-quarter streak of revenue declines, with growth largely driven by a surge in AI infrastructure orders, which amounted to over $350 million during the quarter. Despite this revenue boost, net income fell 8% y-o-y to $2.43 billion, or $0.61 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS increased by 8% to $0.94. Looking ahead, Cisco raised its full-year revenue outlook to a range of $56 billion to $56.5 billion, up from its previous estimate of $55.3 billion to $56.3 billion. The company also increased its adjusted earnings per share forecast to between $3.68 and $3.74, compared to its earlier projection of $3.60 to $3.66. If you are looking for a portfolio with steady gains rather than investing in an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, generating > 91% returns since its inception. Cisco’s fiscal first half saw mixed results, with security revenue doubling y-o-y, while networking revenue dropped by 14%. While product revenue remained stable, service revenue grew by 6% y-o-y, underscoring the industry's shift towards service-based solutions. In March 2024, Cisco completed its $27 billion acquisition of Splunk, a move aimed at strengthening its security offerings. This acquisition aligns with Cisco's strategy to enhance its AI-powered threat detection and response capabilities. Splunk has already contributed positively to Cisco’s revenue; without it, Cisco’s total revenue would have declined by 1% y-o-y. Additionally, Splunk has boosted Cisco's adjusted EPS ahead of expectations. Its AI-driven software, which helps companies analyze log files and manage cybersecurity risks, will be cross-sold to around 5,000 existing Cisco customers identified as potential users. Cisco has also improved its gross margins in recent quarters, benefiting from lower freight and component costs, a more favorable product mix, and overall cost efficiencies. On a GAAP basis, Cisco’s total gross margin, product gross margin, and services gross margin stood at 65.1%, 63.7%, and 68.9%, respectively, compared to 64.2%, 62.7%, and 68.2% in Q2 of fiscal 2024. Similar trends may continue in Q3. The company has also been shifting towards a recurring revenue model through software subscriptions and service contracts, which could further support margins. CSCO stock has experienced volatile returns over the past four years, with performance varying significantly from year to year. It delivered a 46% gain in 2021, a 22% decline in 2022, a 9% increase in 2023, and a 22% gain in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has exhibited much lower volatility while consistently outperforming the S&P 500. What sets it apart? This portfolio has delivered superior returns with reduced risk, offering a smoother ride than individual stock investments. You can see the difference in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. We have revised our Cisco Valuation to $65 per share, based on an expected EPS of $3.70 and a P/E multiple of 17.6x for fiscal 2025. However, this valuation is roughly in line with the current market price as of January 12. You can also explore our detailed Cisco Revenue analysis for a closer look at its key revenue sources.

Title: ‘The tide is turning’: why more parents are delaying access to smartphones for children starting secondary school

A few months ago Mary Lovegrove was at the gates of her son’s primary school talking to other parents about how they felt forced into giving their children smartphones once they moved on to second level. “Everyone was just resigned to it,” says Lovegrove, whose son (12) starts first year in September. “We were really dreading it, but felt we’d little choice because all their classmates would have one.” From Glasthule in Dublin, she decided to set up a WhatsApp group last November for parents of other children due to start at her son’s secondary school in the hope a handful of other like-minded parents might join. Within days 100 parents had signed up. As of this week, a total of 124 parents – about 75 per cent of the class’s parents – have joined the “delay smartphones and/or social media” group. The second-level school her son is due to attend is one of about a dozen, mostly in the South Dublin area, where similar parent-led WhatsApp groups have emerged in recent weeks. They include St Andrew’s College and Coláiste Íosagáin in Booterstown, Newpark Comprehensive School and Sion Hill College in Blackrock, Loreto Foxrock, Loreto Dalkey and others. There are early signs of others sprouting up among parents of soon-to-be first-year students in Cork, Galway and elsewhere. Parents are, in a way, conducting a large-scale social experiment: can they hold out in the face of their children’s self-proclaimed wants and needs, the might of social media’s addictive algorithms and what many see as a failure by successive governments to regulate the dangers of the online world. [ Can a school smartphone ban work? Here’s what principals and anti-bullying researchers thinkOpens in new window ] “Intuitively, we know that giving them a smartphone at that age is just too early,” Lovegrove says. “But I feel like the tide is turning. It’s about strength in numbers. If parents know their child won’t be the only one without a smartphone, it makes it much easier to delay.” Eoghan Cleary sees the impact of children’s unfettered internet access among his students on a daily basis. He is an assistant principal, English teacher and coordinator of SPHE (social, personal and health education) at Temple Carrig, a mixed secondary school in Greystones. In discussions with his students, he says it is clear they are being bombarded with an array of highly inappropriate and damaging content – with serious consequences. “As soon as the internet realises you’re a teenage boy or girl, you are flooded with stuff which their research shows will keep you scrolling,” he says. “For guys, it’s all the misogynistic content. All of the narratives that men are being falsely accused of rape; that if you don’t have a father you’re more likely to be a rapist, a criminal and a drug addict – all this comes up in the classroom,” he says. “And then for girls, they’re just bombarded with fake Ozempic nasal sprays, tanning injections, teeth filing, fake Botox supplements – all the stuff that’s based on their appearance and more so about their sexualisation.” The proliferation of pornography is everywhere online, he says, and across all social media platforms. “If you’re a female student, you get direct messages regularly asking for nude selfies. I had a first-year group ... who had a WhatsApp group which was primarily used for porn sharing.” The impact of all this, he says, is deeply troubling. Cleary has received disclosures of sexual assault from students who were at parties; evidence of students being blackmailed online after sharing sexual images of themselves; reports of self-harm in school bathrooms; worryingly high levels of anxiety and school refusal. Research shows mental health problems have soared since smartphones became ubiquitous well over a decade ago. There have been numerous warnings, too, of weakened social bonds, increased loneliness, sadness and social anxiety among children. [ McEntee to push ahead with €9m smartphone pouches as study casts doubt over their meritsOpens in new window ] While some large-scale studies are slow to solidify a causal relationship between social media usage and these problems, Cleary has no such reservations. “To me, it’s so bloody obvious that it’s smartphones ... but I’m also at pains to state that it isn’t really about smartphones alone; it’s giving the internet access to your child, through any device. It is not so much what your child does online; it’s what the online world does as soon as it realises who your child is ... this wasn’t so much of a problem before algorithms.” Hilda Hamilton is one of the parents signed up to the “delay smartphones” campaign. A mother of three from Sandymount in Dublin, she is determined to hold off getting a smartphone for her eldest son (12). “My gut feeling is there is something fundamentally wrong with giving a smartphone at that age,” she says. “I know how much I use it and I’m 44. It is so addictive – yet we’re expecting them to have the emotional intelligence to handle it.” She feels parents are being failed by government, regulators and social media companies, but is cheered by the fact that parents are taking action. Like many in the WhatsApp groups, she is thinking of giving her son an old-style Nokia or Balance phone, designed to block addictive content and apps, instead. “I’m pro technology and being able to communicate, but want to delay his access to social media ... It would purely be a means of contacting him. You can still have independence with a normal phone.” Gill Hurley from Dalkey has told her 12-year-old he will not be getting a phone. “Is he delighted? No, but he understands my view ... they don’t have to like it, but if they understand your reasons, I think they will get more on-board ... “I’m not naive and I know the pressure will be on when he starts second level ... but I also know that if I gave him a smartphone, I’d be arguing all the time about apps and screen time. So, this really is the lesser of the two evils.” For some parents involved in the initiative, it is a second chance to take a different path. Ross Staunton gave his daughter in second year a smartphone when she started second level on the basis that all her class would have one. Having seen the impact of it, he wants to delay doing the same for his son who starts secondary school in September. “The crunch time will come in the summer,” he admits. “We’re all talking a good game at the moment and most, I think, are planning to press ahead with it. Even if some do cave in, I’m hopeful there will be enough. It will require bravery from parents. I think if we can hold off until 14 or 15 years of age, you’re doing well.” Eoghan Cleary regularly gives talks to parents at schools about staying safe online. He has been doing it for about eight years but only recently felt a “tipping point” in the level of interest. “Back then there might have been 10 or 14 people in the room turning up. Now, the rooms are packed with hundreds of parents. Parents are more aware. They can see what’s going on with their children and don’t know what to do about it.” One of his key messages, he says, is that parents have power – even if they don’t realise it. “Otherwise, governments are not going to do anything. Yes, there’s a large corporate tech lobby out there. But as soon as the parents come together and say, ‘you need to protect our children online’, they will have to act.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: 5 Low-cost Altcoins with Millionaire-Making Potential

As the fabled altcoin season draws closer, investors have started positioning themselves for the expected growth. Even so, knowing which top crypto coin is primed for an extended rally among the thousands of altcoins available on the market is challenging. Based on expert research and analysis, this piece highlights five top altcoins under a $4 valuation that have the potential to trigger a parabolic surge in the coming weeks. These assets include XRP, Cardano, Tron, Sui, and the ChowWow (CHOW) meme project. Here’s why investing in these altcoins in February could yield significant ROIs for investors in 2025. The last quarter of 2024 was eventful for the XRP token, given the legal victory against the SEC and the token’s significant value growth in the market. Similarly, XRP seeks to consolidate its momentum in Q1 of 2025 and beyond. For context, market stats show that XRP’s price gained over 380% since the start of the last quarter, growing from $0.52 to a price peak of $3.4 in January. Prospectively, XRP is on the right path toward an extended bullish trajectory. That is because of the growing real-world adoption of the project, as evidenced by a partnership between XRP and Unicâmbio to facilitate cross-border transactions between Brazil and Portugal. Similarly, the pursuit of XRP ETF approval from multiple asset management firms like BlackRock, Grayscale, and recent Nasdaq ETF applications all point toward a bullish sentiment that the token harbors. With Bank of America using XRP for all their transactions, the market will likely witness parabolic growth for XRP in 2025. As such, XRP is one of the best altcoins to buy, and HODL for future gains. Despite seeing about an 18% decline within the last month, Cardano (ADA) is on a bullish trajectory. That is because the Cardano blockchain has undergone a revolutionary upgrade, and a possible collaboration with global tech leader Microsoft is on the horizon. For context, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson hinted at a possible collaboration between Cardano and Microsoft, a move that could trigger a chain of bullish uptrend. Also, following Cardano’s latest Plomin Hard Fork upgrade, the network is now fully decentralized, allowing stakeholders the power to vote on the native blockchain. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s filing for a Cardano ETF has elevated the bullish potential of the Cardano token to new heights. Given the heightened bullish sentiment of altcoin since the start of the year, the token is likely to set a new ATH in 2025. Market stats show that the Cardano price is still above the $0.70 support level. As such, a rise above $1 could push the ADA price to a new level. This makes it one of the top altcoins to invest in 2025. The Tron token has witnessed a significant uptrend in value with a 10% price growth within the past month, as per stats from CoinMarketCap. Having recorded an all-time price high of $0.44 on December 4th, the Tron crypto coin declined with the market-wide bearish trend of January. However, investors may gear up for another round of bullish momentum especially considering the positive market trends on the Tron Blockchain. For context, Cointelegraph reports that over $2.02 billion worth of stablecoins have been issued on the Tron network within the first week of February, only second to Ethereum ($2.43 billion). Notably, the Tron network has outpaced Ethereum in revenue inflow over the past months, signaling an increasing transaction volume. As the Tron network continues to see more volume, the value of the TRX token is expected to grow, pushing more market demand and higher growth potential. Although the Tron trading volume is down, the altcoin price is expected to rally when the market recovers. Overall, Tron is one of the top altcoins that is poised for significant growth in 2025. Undoubtedly, the Sui token is undergoing a major price retracement that has seen it lose about 23% in value within the past month as per market stats. However, the retracement could be an opportunity to buy the Sui coin before a likely bullish breakout. It should be noted that Sui’s price recorded an all-time price high of $5.35 on January 6th before the recent market correction. However, the increasing expansion of Sui in the market could trigger a rally for the top altcoin in no time. For context, traders can now buy the Sui token directly in the Phantom wallet. Also, the move to roll out internetless transactions on the Sui network via SMS is another game-changer that will boost the blockchain’s accessibility and volume, increasing Sui’s use case and value over time. While several altcoins have dipped in the past weeks, Sui’s price has maintained support above $3. Crypto analyst Momin, in a tweet on X, expects the Sui crypto price to surge once the market gains clarity, with a high possibility of retesting the $4 mark. Given Sui’s massive potential, the price might surpass $10 in 2025, making it one of the altcoins to watch in the year. Even while in presale, investors have recognized the exponential bullish trajectory of the ChowWow (CHOW) meme coin project. That is why thousands of investors have already purchased the ChowWow presale ahead of launch. With up to 260% ROI projection before launch, ChowWow harbors an even bigger growth potential post-launch. For context, ChowWow is a community-driven meme coin project inspired by the Chinese Chow Chow dog breed. As such, the ChowWow project is a decentralized embodiment of the Chow dog that will provide strong community engagement, intuitive features, and the opportunity to generate fortune on the platform. ChowWow comes with elaborate utilities, such as the play-to-earn feature, which rewards players with gifts that can be converted to real-world value. The stake-to-earn feature is another use case where users can stake their $CHOW tokens and earn up to 8 – 15% in APY, which will be paid monthly. Other exciting community engagements include airdrops, social media campaigns, and competitions. Built on the Solana network, ChowWow will inherit the network’s low fees and faster transaction processing, ensuring that users have a seamless gaming experience. The native token CHOW is used for in-game purchases on the P2E platform. Outside that, it is a means of distributing rewards, cashback, and more. Like Shiba Inu, the CHOW token is deflationary with a buy-and-burn mechanism designed to stabilize the price. All these are likely to boost the price in the long term. Sold for just $0.008, now is the best time to accumulate the meme coin which is picked as the next 100x Solana coin. Visit ChowWow Presale All the top crypto assets reviewed in this piece harbor significant bullish potential and should be considered for investment. However, for investors with limited funds that can’t be invested in all the tokens highlighted, prioritizing the ChowWow presale is likely the best bet. That’s because ChowWow is still in its presale phase and hasn’t witnessed the massive rallies that come with a project launch or crypto exchange listing. Also, the low price entry advantage and high utility offering make ChowWow one of the best altcoins to invest in for investors looking for projects that can easily hit 10x in the coming weeks.

Title: The rumors about the reshuffle at M.M. (and what is true), Nikos, the Sorbonne and Google, the 9-million-euro café, the Sklavenitis-Panteliadis battle

Hello, so as expected, the videos submitted to the investigator regarding the Tempi accident do not show any undeclared cargo in the wagons. Today or tomorrow, the forensic report from the Hellenic Police laboratories regarding their authenticity will be released, and we move on. And I say “expected” because only a suicidal person would voluntarily submit fake videos in such a case. Now you might say, “Can public opinion be convinced that there is no cover-up, as 70%-80% of all polls indicate?” The answer is “no,” but just as people roughly understood that the government didn’t care much about the Tempi issue after the elections, now they will slowly begin to realize that the little system set up against it is not about delivering justice for Tempi. And, of course, part of that system is the trio “Androulakis-Velopoulos-Zoi,” along with the many others who have vested interests, exploiting pain and anger. Patience is needed to watch this whole play unfold. Reshuffle I asked my source about the reshuffle, and you might ask why I ask…on a permanent basis. Well, because when we enter a reshuffle period, it’s good to ask often, as the situation changes very quickly. My reliable source tells me that the reshuffle is set for March. There are no changes at the M.M., Pavlos Marinakis stays there, Kostis Hatzidakis is also not going to be vice president at M.M. (these rumors have been circulating lately), and if there is an addition, it will be the truly significant one of Gerapetritis, which, however, has not yet been decided by the Prime Minister. The Sorbonne at Maximos This afternoon, the officials from the Sorbonne University, who arrived in Athens yesterday evening, will be at Maximos Mansion to present Mitsotakis with their application for establishing the first Greek branch under the Pierrakakis law. Earlier, they will have gone to the Ministry of Education to submit the relevant application. At M.M., there will be the vice president of Sorbonne, Olivier Houdart, the dean of the School of Political and Social Studies, Anne Fossone, the president of the French College of Greece, Stelios Amargianakis, and the director of International Relations, Alexandros Despotopoulos. The five-year operational plan submitted for approval to the competent authorities includes €15 million in investments for a campus, €3 million for cutting-edge research, and over €7 million in scholarships. The plan initially includes three faculties: Law, Economics-Management, and Physical Education, with a prospect of increasing to six faculties within five years, including a School of Media and Communication. Google it, chief! Now, regarding the Sorbonne, we had another comedy episode yesterday with PASOK, especially with its leader Nikos, who mocked Pierrakakis, claiming that this so-called Sorbonne University coming here is fake. Pierrakakis didn’t do much in response, don’t think otherwise, he just wrote a reply telling him that with a simple Google search, Androulakis could find the public French university Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, which is one of the 13 institutions that succeeded the famous University of Paris and has 26,000 students and 1,200 professors. He also responded that this university’s planned investment in Greece is €15 million for a campus and another €10 million for research, scholarships, etc. So, I ask, as good-naturedly as I can, honestly, how hard is it, man, to pick up a phone and ask someone more specialized in education (PASOK had dozens) to give you the right perspective on such a simple issue? But no, Nikos is busy dealing with butchers… At M.M. for Attica’s garbage The government and the Prime Minister himself must immediately make crucial decisions regarding the role of the Unified Waste Management Association, which manages Attica’s waste. After two audit reports on the previous administration’s projects and actions, direct awards, and rodent control contracts, as well as the disciplinary referral for misconduct of five elected officials who participated in the EDSNA administration under Patoulis, the association’s file is being prioritized for evaluation. Reports indicate that a meeting is scheduled at Maximos Mansion today regarding the waste association and the bold decisions the government must make for the future and how it will operate. The agenda of the meeting is unknown, but sources suggest that Mitsotakis’ office has a plan to dissolve EDSNA and temporarily transfer its responsibilities to the president of PEDA (Regional Association of Municipalities of Attica) and mayor of Galatsi, Giorgos Markopoulos. The goal for the new entity is for the Region to have no involvement, with only the municipalities participating, while all major Public-Private Partnership (PPP) waste management projects for Attica will be centrally handled by the Ministry of Environment. What I genuinely don’t understand is, first, how it is possible to dissolve an organization like EDSNA, which is currently under the scrutiny of inspectors and prosecutors following reports of mismanagement? If nothing else, there is a serious ethical issue, and perhaps its dissolution could even be interpreted as a cover-up. And second, are municipalities really being called upon once again to solve Athens’ garbage problem after twenty years? And who guarantees us that there is less corruption there? Petralias’ Concern for Santorini If there is one person who these days has an additional concern about the situation in Santorini, as a competent source tells me, it is the Deputy Minister of Finance Thanos Petralias, who “holds” the treasury. Petralias knows well that last year Santorini accounted for 2.5% of GDP, as the season was booming, and the cruise industry also performed very well. In absolute numbers, Santorini contributed approximately 6 billion to GDP. An additional reason for concern is the stability of the island’s port. So, as you can understand, in the state treasury, they listen with great concern to the scenarios of an extended seismic sequence (and the emergency measures). Duel Between Sklavenitis-Panteliadis and Vardinogiannis’ Entry Competition in wholesale sales for professionals, companies, etc., is heating up. The Sklavenitis group, which owns the The Mart chain, has decided to strengthen its wholesale network to increase its market share, which places it in second place. Sklavenitis’ decision threatens Panteliadis, who has established himself in first place in the market with Metro Cash and Carry. The Mart currently has 14 stores, and the next move from Sklavenitis is expansion into the islands, as it currently has a presence only in Chania and Heraklion. In 2023, The Mart had a turnover of 432 million and net profits of 11 million. I should note that both Sklavenitis and Panteliadis are closely monitoring the move by G. Vardinogiannis to enter the small retail market by acquiring the Smart Shop chain through Motor Oil, which also has stores outside gas stations. Smart Shop does not directly affect the supermarket customer, but it can compete with convenience stores, grocery stores, etc., that are wholesale customers. After 9 Years and 9 Million (for a Bakery) And since we are on the topic of chains and their plans, let me tell you the final cost for Veneti-Jackson Hall on the Milioni pedestrian street in Kolonaki, which is the flagship store of the Veneti network. The store is now operating, and from the moment Veneti took over until it opened to the public, nine years had to pass. During this period, the initial budget of 2 million euros reached 9 million. As you can imagine, amortization is very difficult if not impossible. Capital Increase of 56 Million in Europe Holdings The capital increase being planned by Europe Holdings (the entity resulting from the merger of KLM–Intracom Properties) will be at the level of 56 million euros as part of the strategy that has as its next stage the already agreed acquisition of Europe Insurance for the creation of a business hub with a presence in insurance as well as real estate management. On 6/3, the extraordinary General Assembly for the capital increase is expected to take place, and if the timeline is followed, the process is expected to be completed by the end of April, so that the shareholder changes can then be finalized, through which Nikos Makropoulos, the current owner of the insurance company, will become a shareholder with 10.3% of the new entity, the second largest after Intracom Holdings. The entire venture for Europe Holdings will be completed before Easter. Komarek with McLaren Allwyn, the parent group of OPAP, has signed an agreement that ensures it global exposure to further strengthen its international development. In combination with the long-term partnership it is initiating with Formula 1, it has entered into an official collaboration with the McLaren team, the F1 Constructors’ Champion for 2024. This partnership has a clear goal of strengthening the group’s activities and brand worldwide, and as an official partner of McLaren Racing, the Allwyn logo will appear on the cars and the team’s driver suits. Karel Komarek, owner of Allwyn, has long-standing ties with the world of F1 and, together with David Coulthard—former world champion—has founded, funds, and supports the initiative “More Than Equal” with the goal of preparing for the emergence of the first female Formula 1 World Champion Driver. The Stoiximan boosts OPAP And since we are in a gambling environment, on the sidelines of yesterday’s Stoiximan event that brought the UEFA Europa League and Conference League trophies to Athens, the company’s executives emphasized the excellent performance recorded in the previous year’s financial figures. Stoiximan recorded double-digit growth, driven primarily by the sportsbook, which was strengthened by the major sporting events of the year, especially Euro 2024. This rise, as stated by the executives of the new management team led by Managing Director Nikos Fligos, was also accompanied by a significant increase in new customer registrations, forming a strong base for this year as well. These performances will naturally be reflected in the results of OPAP, which holds an 84.49% stake and maintains exclusive control of Stoiximan and its operations in Greece and Cyprus. OPAP will announce its 2024 financial results on March 19, followed by the annual shareholders’ meeting on March 29. Earlier, the dividend amount will be disclosed, which is eagerly anticipated by the market, as a pre-dividend of 0.60 euros has already been issued. The entrepreneurs aiming to become the country’s largest winemakers A new company has been established by the Georgiadis brothers of Sterner Stenhus, who—beyond their other investments—have set a goal to become the largest winemakers in the country. As is known, they have already incorporated the historic “Boutari” winery under their group’s umbrella (with Semeli joining just a few days ago). The new company, headed by George Rentià, Chief Financial Officer of Sterner Stenhus Greece, is titled “Scalarea Crete Single-Member S.A.” and is based in Fantaxometocho of the Skalani settlement. Its purpose ranges from wine production to holiday accommodations and many other activities, while its initial share capital is 200,000 euros, which “Boutari Wineries S.A.,” represented by Thomas Georgiadis, has undertaken to cover. However, behind this matter lies an interesting backstory. It concerns the Boutari estate in Crete, which includes 73 acres of vineyards, its most modern winery, and even a boutique hotel. The newest and most modernly designed “Boutari” winery was completed in early 2004 and is built outside the village of Skalani, on the Fantaxometocho estate, just 8 km from the center of Heraklion and 4 km from the archaeological site of Knossos. Fantaxometocho, the Georgiadis brothers, and the Logothetis family The Fantaxometocho estate, also known as the “Ghost Estate,” owes its name to the efforts of its first owner to protect it from pirate raids by spreading rumors that ghosts inhabited the property. Beyond the winery, however, a decade ago, through the Scalarea IKE company, founded in June 2014, a plan was initiated to create a small complex with three luxury rooms. Shortly after, a partnership was formed with Aria Hotels, a subsidiary of the Logothetis family (Libra Group), a well-known chain of boutique hotels and independent residences across numerous island and mainland destinations in Greece. At the time, it was stated that “in the spring of 2015, the Boutari winery, through its partnership with Aria Hotels, created the Scalani Hills Boutari Winery and Residences,” which includes three luxury residences named Kotsifali, Malvasia, and Liatiko, housed in the fully renovated old estate. In 2022, Scalarea IKE was renamed “Blue Rock Suites MIKE” and remains part of Aria Hotels. Now, whether the Georgiadis brothers’ new company intends to open another accommodation facility in addition to the winery at Fantaxometocho or take over the existing one, we will see in the coming period. Fais Group’s Prospectus to the Capital Market Commission in Early March Barring unforeseen circumstances, the submission of the Fais Group’s Prospectus is expected within the first ten days of March, aiming to raise 50-60 million euros and list its shares on the Main Market of the Athens Stock Exchange. The management is anticipating a “pleasant surprise” from the 2024 results to complement the Prospectus. In 2023, revenue reached 191.3 million euros (up from 163.2 million euros in 2022), and net profits amounted to 4.7 million euros, up from 2.7 million euros. Sales for 2024 have already exceeded 200 million euros. The Group’s secret weapon lies in its wide range of activities, spanning from the distribution of sportswear and wellness equipment to luxury footwear and accessories, premium & lifestyle fashion products, cosmetics distribution, and, of course, commercial real estate development. The Stock Market Celebrated the “Peace Party” Since March 28, 2011 (during the government of George Papandreou), the General Index of the Athens Stock Exchange had not reached 1,600 points. Fully aligned yesterday with the “peace party” of major European markets, with an impressive increase in transaction value to 212.7 million euros (only 22.11 million in packages), the General Index abandoned its sideways upward movement of recent weeks and surged with a +2.49% increase to 1,600.97 points. The Athens Stock Exchange seems poised today to complete its eighth consecutive week of gains, while the total market capitalization has reached 112 billion euros. To be absolutely precise, the majority of yesterday’s rise in the General Index is undoubtedly due to the Coca Cola 3E stock, which reached a market capitalization of 14.3 billion euros, with an impressive +7.9% increase to 38.5 euros, driven by the excellent financial results announced in the morning and the promise of a 1.03 euros per share dividend, up 11% year-on-year. If half of the index’s rise is attributed to Coca Cola, half of the transaction value is owed to the banks. Piraeus stood out with a 3.9% rise to 4.66 euros, closely followed by National Bank (+3.61%) at 8.6 euros, Alpha Bank (+3.21%) at 1.847 euros, and Eurobank (+2.5%) at 2.46 euros. Not many expect interest rate cuts in the immediate future (which has implications for bank profits), and this sentiment was reflected in the bond market. The 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond yields 4.55%, the German Bond 2.41%, the French Bond 3.10%, and the Greek Bond follows closely at 3.25%. Metlen, which has been on a strong upward trend in recent days, closed at 35.96 euros (+1.87%) and, with a market capitalization nearing 5 billion euros, has secured its entry into the FTSE 100 index in London. TITAN halted its recent decline following TITAN America’s entry into Wall Street and rose +1.17% to close at 43.1 euros. Motor Oil is aiming for its 10th consecutive positive session today, having closed yesterday with a +1.56% increase at 22.2 euros. Not a single stock in the FTSE had a negative sign yesterday. The Largest Artificial Intelligence Data Center in Europe Europe is searching for its own champion in Artificial Intelligence, but developments in the field have come from the United Arab Emirates, which announced an investment of 30 to 50 billion euros for the creation of the largest AI data center in Europe. The project will be built in France and will be the heart of a new “AI campus,” with power reaching up to one gigawatt. This announcement was made during the meeting between French President Emmanuel Macron and UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The French government had already identified 35 locations for the development of AI data centers, emphasizing the country’s strategic importance in the global AI race. The battle for Europe’s AI champion has already begun. The Whole World Is Buying Stocks on Wall Street In the past 12 months, non-U.S. investors have purchased 520 billion dollars’ worth of stocks on Wall Street. This means that foreign investors now control 59% of financial assets in the U.S., surpassing even the levels of the Dot-Com bubble in 2000. For comparison, in the past 12 months, net inflows into emerging markets totaled 220 billion euros, 57% less than the inflows into the U.S. market. Developed markets outside of Wall Street attracted only 20 billion dollars in investment capital inflows. Every day, the entire world is focused on New York. Especially in recent times, with Trump’s daily “surprises,” a massive buying spree has begun among hedge funds, which were net buyers of U.S. stocks for five consecutive days last week, at the fastest pace since November 2024. They selected eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, excluding only financial companies (banks, investment firms, etc.) and the real estate sector. The champion in attracting hedge fund capital was, unsurprisingly, the Information Technology sector. The Planet Is Adopting Cryptocurrencies 43% Faster Than Mobile Phones Cryptocurrencies have now surpassed 300 million users and dedicated followers in just 12 years. According to BlackRock, the planet is adopting cryptocurrencies 43% faster than mobile phones and 20% faster than the internet. Younger generations, inflation fears, and Trump’s pro-crypto stance are fueling the steady upward trend. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are expected to reach 250 billion dollars. Every day, particularly in the U.S., the cryptocurrency market gains “institutional conquests” and popular acceptance. Explore related questions

Title: Jeff Bezos-Backed Space Company Blue Origin To Lay Off 10% Workforce

Full Content:
Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin LLC is cutting about 10% of its workforce, a significant pullback aimed at slashing costs and refocusing resources after years of development work. The rocket and engine maker laid out the personnel shakeup during an all-hands employee meeting with Chief Executive Officer Dave Limp Thursday morning, confirming a workforce reduction first reported by Bloomberg. In a memo sent to employees, Limp said the company's growth led to "more bureaucracy and less focus" than needed after a hiring spree over the past few years. After years of expansion bankrolled by Bezos, who started Amazon.com Inc. and is the world's third-richest person, Blue Origin is looking to trim manager ranks as it works to clear some $10 billion worth of launch contracts. With a staff of more than 10,000, the layoffs stand to impact over 1,000 roles. Blue Origin is eliminating positions in engineering, research and development, and project management, as well as "thinning out our layers of management," Limp wrote in the email, which was viewed by Bloomberg. The surprise round of layoffs comes about a month after Blue Origin debuted its flagship New Glenn rocket following years of delays and development setbacks. Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000. Since then, the company's payroll has gone as high as roughly 14,000 employees spread across its headquarters in the Seattle area and sprawling manufacturing and launch operations sites in Florida, Texas and Alabama. Blue Origin maintains an ambitious space portfolio that includes space tourism, a moon lander, space station and supplying rocket engines. Blue Origin has drawn unfavorable comparisons to Elon Musk's SpaceX, which leapfrogged many startups over the past quarter century to become the world's most prolific rocket launcher. Limp, an ex-Amazon leader, was hired in 2023 to help shake the company out of a years-long R&D slump. Limp added that the company is looking to the future, including landing an uncrewed vehicle on the moon in 2025 and increasing the cadence of New Glenn and New Shepard launches.

Title: Dating App Cover-Up: How Tinder, Hinge, and Their Corporate Owner Keep Rape Under Wraps – The Markup

Challenging technology to serve the public good. The company behind more than a dozen dating apps, Match Group, has known for years about the abusive users on its platforms, but chooses to leave millions of people in the dark By Emily Elena Dugdale and Hanisha Harjani The Dating Apps Reporting Project is an 18-month investigation. It was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center’s AI Accountability Network and The Markup, now a part of CalMatters, and copublished with The Guardian and The 19th. When a young woman in Denver met up with a smiling cardiologist she matched with on the dating app Hinge, she had no way of knowing that the company behind the app had already received reports from two other women who accused him of rape. She met the 34-year-old doctor with green eyes and thinning hair at Highland Tap & Burger, a sports bar in a trendy neighborhood. It went well enough that she accepted an invitation to go back to his apartment. As she emerged from his bathroom, he handed her a tequila soda. What transpired over the next 24 hours, according to court testimony, reads like every person’s dating app nightmare. After sipping the drink, the woman started to lose control. Her memory blurred. She fell to the ground, and the man started to film her. He put her in a headlock, kissing her forehead; she struggled to free herself but managed to grab her things and leave. He followed her out the door, holding her shoes and trying to force her back inside, but she was able to call an Uber, vomiting in the car on the way home. Because it turns out moving fast and breaking things broke some super important things. Because it turns out moving fast and breaking things broke some super important things. She woke up at home, soaking wet on her bathroom floor, the key to her house still in her door. She continued vomiting for hours. When she came to, she reported the assault to Hinge. Hinge is one of more than a dozen dating apps owned by Match Group. The $8.5 billion global conglomerate also owns brands like Tinder (the world’s most popular dating app), OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish. Match Group controls half of the world’s online dating market, operates in 190 countries, and facilitates meetups for millions of people. Match Group’s official safety policy states that when a user is reported for assault, “all accounts found that are associated with that user will be banned from our platforms.” So why, on the night of Jan. 25, 2023, was Stephen Matthews still on the app? Just four days before, Match Group had been alerted when another woman reported him for rape. A little more than a week later, he was reported for rape again. This time, the survivor went to the police. None of these women knew that the company had known about his violent behavior for years. He was first reported on Sept. 28, 2020. By then, Match Group’s safety policy was already in place. Even after a police report, it took nearly two months for Matthews to be arrested — the only thing that got him off the apps. By then, at least 15 women would eventually report that Matthews had raped or drugged them. Nearly every one of them had met him on dating apps run by Match Group. On Oct. 25, 2024, a Denver judge sentenced Matthews to 158 years to life in prison after a jury convicted him of 35 counts related to drugging and sexually assaulting eight women, drugging two women, and assaulting one more for a total of 11 women. Attorneys for the women said much of that violence could have been prevented. “It is shocking that for years after receiving reports of sexual assault, Hinge continued to allow Stephen Matthews access to its platforms and actively facilitated his abuse,” said Laura Wolf, the attorney representing the woman whose police report led to the arrest. Following best practices for reporting on sexual assault, the Dating Apps Reporting Project is honoring survivors’ requests for anonymity. Matthews’ attorney, Douglas Cohen, declined to comment. A letter that The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent directly to Matthews in jail went unanswered. Match Group’s reach is so massive — its mission is “to spark meaningful connections for every single person worldwide” — that people are more likely to meet through its apps than out at the bars, at church, or through friends. But Matthews’ case shows that even as these apps have made it easier for us to connect with a seemingly endless pool of potential lovers, they have also made it easier for people who commit sexual abuse to reach a seemingly endless number of potential targets. In 2022, a team of researchers at Brigham Young University published an analysis of hundreds of sexual assaults in Utah. They found attacks facilitated by dating apps happened faster and were more violent than when the perpetrator met the victim through other means. They also found that perpetrators who use dating apps are more likely to target vulnerable people. Almost 60 percent of sexual assault survivors self-reported a mental illness. Match Group has known for years which users have been reported for drugging, assaulting, or raping their dates since at least 2016, according to internal company documents. Since 2019, Match Group’s central database has recorded every user reported for rape and assault across its entire suite of apps; by 2022, the system, known as Sentinel, was collecting hundreds of troubling incidents every week, company insiders say. Match Group promised in 2020 that it would release what’s known as a transparency report — a public document that would reveal data on harm occurring on and off its platforms. If the public were aware of the scale of rape and assault on Match Group apps, they would be able to accurately assess their risk. As of February 2025, the report has not been released. Instead, as people continued to get hurt, the company dithered over what damning information should be hidden. “Do we only publish where we are required by law?” reads a slide in a 2021 presentation shown multiple times to Match Group employees as well as external safety partners. “Do we push back on how much we are required to reveal, or do we try to go beyond what is required?” No online space is risk-free. But while Match Group has long possessed the tools, financial resources, and investigative procedures necessary to make it harder for bad actors to resurface, internal documents show the company has resisted efforts to spread them across its apps, in part because safety protocols could stall corporate growth. “The obsession with metrics and having to stick with them is frustrating and potentially dangerous,” one employee wrote in 2021 after the company learned that the investigative news nonprofit ProPublica was planning a story. “This is not the way we were meant to work and people’s lives are at risk.” The same person asked their superiors: “‘How much would you personally pay to stop just one person being sexually assaulted by a date, one child being trafficked or one vulnerable person being driven to suicide by a predator?’ I feel that if I asked members of our staff that question individually, they would put a high value of their own money on it – But as a group nobody is ready to hear that yet.” Since 2021, Match Group has publicly promised to improve the safety of their products and share data, but company insiders say safety has not improved. A brief hiring spree sparked by congressional and media scrutiny has been largely scaled back, according to former employees. In 2024, the remaining employees from the central trust-and-safety team Match Group set up in response to increased scrutiny were let go and their jobs outsourced to overseas contractors. Facing pressure from Wall Street, Match Group removed CEO Bernard Kim in early February 2025 as he struggled to cut costs and end the steady decline in subscribers to Match Group’s most powerful app, Tinder. Members of Congress have repeatedly requested data from Match Group on sexual harm. In February 2020, 11 members of Congress wrote to then-CEO Shar Dubey asking for details on how the company responds to reports of sexual violence. In July 2023, two Democrats, then-Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire and Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois followed up after we inquired on the status of their efforts. The company has still not provided the data. In September 2024, the House of Representatives passed a bill that requires consumers to be notified if they have interacted with a user on a dating app who has been banned for defrauding consumers of money or personal financial information. But the bill stopped short of addressing the issue of sexual assault on the apps, and it died in the Senate. Our review of hundreds of pages of internal company documents, along with thousands of pages of court records, securities filings, and analyst reports, coupled with dozens of interviews with current and former employees and survivors of sexual violence found women who report being raped get no traction, while accused rapists like Stephen Matthews keep swiping — and assaulting. Our own testing on Match Group apps shows that as of February 2025, not much has changed. Banned Tinder users, including those reported for sexual assault, can easily rejoin or move to another Match Group dating app, all while keeping most of their key personal information exactly the same. The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent Match Group a four-page letter detailing our findings. The company responded with a short statement. The statement did not dispute that Match Group has carefully documented the extent of harm on company apps for years without sharing that information with the public. It also defended the company’s efforts to make platforms safe. “We recognize our role in fostering safer communities and promoting authentic and respectful connections worldwide,” the statement provided by Kayla Whaling, senior director of communications, read. “We will always work to invest in and improve our systems, and search for ways to help our users stay safe, both online and when they connect in real life.” The company said it vigorously combats violence. “We take every report of misconduct seriously, and vigilantly remove and block accounts that have violated our rules regarding this behavior,” its statement read. Our own testing found otherwise. Starting in April 2024, The Dating Apps Reporting Project created a series of Tinder accounts that we subsequently reported for sexual assault. Soon after, Tinder banned the accounts, and we started investigating how easy it would be for a banned user to create new accounts. Repeatedly, we found that users, soon after being banned, could create new Tinder accounts with the exact same name, birthday, and profile photos used on their banned accounts. Users banned from Tinder were also able to sign up for Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish without changing those personal details. To get around the Tinder ban, we used techniques commonly suggested by online guides and forums that don’t require lots of technical knowledge to understand. We were able to verify three techniques that allowed banned Match Group users to repeatedly bypass being flagged when creating new accounts. In its statement, Match Group cast itself as an industry leader in deploying technology to promote safety, including “harassment-preventing AI tools, ID verification for profiles, and a portal that helps us better support and communicate with law enforcement investigating crimes. … Every person deserves safe and respectful experiences. We are committed to doing the work to make dating safer on our platforms and beyond,” the statement said. Sept. 28, 2020 — the date Denver cardiologist Stephen Matthews raped a woman who reported him to Hinge — is also the date Tracey Breeden was brought on as Match Group’s head of safety and social advocacy. Breeden was a flashy hire. “With Tracey coming on board, we are reaffirming our commitment not just to be safety leaders in the dating space, but across the entire tech sector,” then-CEO Shar Dubey said. Sporting a trademark black leather jacket and short, slick-backed hair, Breeden went by the nickname “Tornado” during her 15-year career in law enforcement. What made her attractive to Match Group was her most recent job at Uber. She helped the global ride-hailing company revive its reputation after a series of scandals — from persistent reports of harassment of women employees to allegations that it was ignoring sexual assault that occurred during Uber rides. Working for an Algorithm An investigation by The Markup found that Uber is slow to respond to law enforcement requests, leaving drivers vulnerable to repeated attacks Breeden spearheaded a safety report in 2019 that told the public what Uber knew about nearly every problem, including nationwide reports of intoxicated drivers, traffic fatalities, and incidents of sexual violence. The report became a key metric of success for the company. In hiring Breeden, Match Group hoped to replicate this success across its portfolio of apps. “Corporations,” she said in a press release announcing her arrival, “have a responsibility to help ensure safe experiences for their users.” Breeden’s team garnered public attention for its new safety measures, including partnerships with NGOs, optional AI-assisted photo verification, and a law enforcement portal where police and prosecutors can request data. She also fostered a partnership with Garbo, a startup that offered low-cost background checks. It launched on Tinder in 2022. Experts point out that background checks are not always reliable as they pull from outdated databases, and research suggests that most people who commit sexual abuse do not encounter the criminal justice system. For example, Matthews had no criminal record. During this time, Match Group invested $100 million into safety as a recurring cost, the company said, and boasted about Breeden’s “central safety team.” Her team of veteran safety professionals referred to themselves as “The Avengers,” even donning superhero costumes at company events. But Michael Lawrie called this “safety theater.” Lawrie worked for Match Group for nearly a decade, shaping and leading a safety team for one of the company’s smaller brands, OkCupid. Sometimes working 80-hour weeks, he spent hours, even days, sniffing out savvy users who tried to thwart bans by creating multiple accounts. Over a 30-year career in content moderation, Lawrie said, he saw many users like Stephen Matthews. “You’re dealing with one repeat offender. I’ve dealt with god knows how many repeat offenders,” he said. A yellow Post-it note on the side of Lawrie’s computer listed out some of his responsibilities: “Rape flags. … Investigate miscreants.” These days, Lawrie is trying to start an advocacy organization for content moderators and other front-line safety workers. But, he said, he’s done with dating apps. “I don’t think they’re safe enough at the moment,” he said. “They’re gonna get worse. …I’m hoping dating sites vanish.” Lawrie said he was initially excited about Breeden’s hire. He said she spent her first few months on the job talking to each brand’s safety team, and told him that she was “very impressed” by the work OkCupid was doing. Each of Match Group’s biggest apps provided their self-described strengths and weaknesses to Breeden’s team, according to an internal spreadsheet. At Hinge, these weaknesses included a “very rudimentary warning system with no targeted comms and no follow through” and “no way to find” the original profile “of a bad actor who has created multiple profiles.” Breeden was confronted with an existential problem. “Our current ban categories won’t allow us to answer the public’s biggest question: Am I likely to be harmed on my date?” reads a slide in a presentation drafted by her team in April 2021. While each of Match Group’s apps had a system of reporting and banning violent users, the information was disorganized, and none of the apps talked to each other. Lawrie hoped Breeden would improve safety at the company. But he quickly grew frustrated that neither she nor Match Group leadership listened to his pleas for what they really needed to make platforms safer: To hire trained — and expensive — investigators and integrate powerful moderation tools across all the apps. OkCupid already had those tools. Lawrie was using them every day.One of those was the Sentinel system, which had been up and running across Match Group’s apps for at least five years before Breeden arrived. It works like this: When a user is banned for something serious — like sexual assault — a case is created in Sentinel with the phone number and email address associated with their account. In interviews, multiple current and former employees described how those reports circulate through each of Match Group’s apps. The system is designed to ban anyone who uses that information. It also grabs the original profile’s IP addresses, photos, and birthdate. Such a system seems robust at first glance — but none of the Match Group’s apps require users to provide photo identification (the kind needed to buy alcohol or board an airplane), so once a person is kicked out, they can easily start a new account with different contact information. A quick search yields scores of online forums with clear steps and suggestions for how to rejoin the apps. In addition, internal company documents show information on IP addresses, photos, and birthdate were not used to ban a user if they appear on another Match dating app. Lawrie’s team at OkCupid knew Sentinel could only do so much. So his team deployed other tools to fix its shortcomings, including one that could automatically ban a profile that was linked to a phone number, photo, or URL that had been previously banned — even if the user made an account with a different email or IP address. This tool was designed to be proactive rather than reactive, so that the profiles of alleged perpetrators like Matthews would not resurface after they had been reported. Internal company documents from 2019 and 2020 show thousands of reports of “serious physical assault,” abuse, or violence on OkCupid that were deemed serious enough to get users banned from all of Match Group’s apps. This is among the information the company kept from the public. Breeden and Match Group leadership praised Lawrie and his team at OkCupid, he said, for their thorough investigative work and for handling some of the company’s most difficult cases. Yet, he said, Match Group never built out a skilled, experienced investigative unit at other brands like the one he headed up at OkCupid. Under Breeden’s leadership, he said, they faced pressure to speed up investigations and train outsourced labor to use complicated moderation tools. A week after a damning article in 2021 revealed that content moderators with little training were asked to rapidly deal with violent sexual content across Match Group’s brands, then-CEO Dubey sent out an all-staff email addressing the controversy. She CC’d Breeden, acknowledging that the brand’s safety teams were not all on equal footing. As Match Group prepared internally for the story to break, Lawrie was asked to write a report for Breeden outlining his team’s accomplishments “to make sure when Tracey describes and acknowledges what you are doing individually to celebrate the good work that you are doing.” Lawrie used that report to protest. “Most professionals aren’t judged on how many cases they can hurry through in an hour,” he wrote. The way Match Group expects its trust-and-safety and support teams to work “basically diminishes their skills and makes them production-line workers.” Breeden declined to comment for this story, citing a nondisclosure agreement. Lawrie left the company in 2022 and said most of his small team that was ferreting out malicious users also left due to a negative workplace environment. He said much of their work was outsourced to contractors with little training and severe quotas. He now cautions anyone using a dating app to understand that they’re not in the business of protecting users. “You’re on your own pretty much,” he said. As Lawrie was getting pushed out of Match Group, Matthews kept appearing on the company’s apps. One crisp fall evening in 2022, one of the Denver cardiologist’s old medical school classmates was on Hinge when her phone screen filled up with a familiar face. Matthews was being promoted on the app as a Standout, a popular profile that Hinge’s algorithm thinks you’ll like. To match with a Standout, users must send the person a rose. They get one free rose a week, but they cost $3.99 a pop after that. His classmate did not send Matthews a rose. By this point, Matthews had already been reported for rape at least once to Hinge. Court documents show that he had already allegedly sexually assaulted nine women and drugged 10. Not only did the apps allow him back on, they featured Matthews’ profile. As the COVID-19 pandemic dragged on, people got tired of forking money over for dating apps. Match Group still made a hefty profit, but its growth flatlined. Its stock cratered, losing nearly half its value between October 2021 and April 2022. That month, an analyst from J.P. Morgan wrote that the firm had received more messages about “the underperformance of MTCH shares in recent weeks than any other topic.” In May 2022, Match ousted Dubey and installed Bernard Kim as CEO, a former executive at the gaming company Zynga that popularized viral games like “FarmVille.” While Dubey spoke frequently about trust and safety and worked closely with Breeden, Kim hardly mentioned safety when he began his time at Match Group, instead emphasizing the need for continued rapid expansion to drive long-term shareholder value. Lawrie said that Kim, with his background in gaming rather than dating apps, had no interest in love. “He just wants to make money. He’s just there to increase profits,” Lawrie said. “If he’s looking at a bottom line, then it’s easier to have a lawsuit than it is to provide safety. I know which one he’s gonna pick.” Match Group declined to make Bernard Kim available for an interview. Messages sent to Kim directly went unreturned. While the tension between growth and safety exists across the tech sector, it is especially high at dating apps companies where executives have to worry about constant churn — users leaving the apps when they are no longer looking for dates. Every time Match Group delivers on its promise, it also loses customers. In February 2024, six dating app users filed what they hope will be certified as a class action lawsuit. They argue Match Group uses “addictive” features to encourage compulsive use while not leading to any real increase in off-app relationships. “The app is designed specifically to hook them, and to keep them paying subscription fees — not to help them find love,” attorney Ryan Clarkson said. Match Group filed to dismiss the lawsuit in September, noting in its quarterly report that it “will defend vigorously” against the allegations. Despite Kim’s efforts, Match Group’s stock price continued to drop, and during that time, so did any mention of trust and safety. In over a year of quarterly investor calls, Kim only referenced safety efforts once. Employees who pushed for these initiatives were forced out or laid off, including Breeden — a leader who was so convinced of her own invincibility that she showed up to an event wielding a Captain America shield. Match Group fired its power hire in October 2022. Layoffs hit her team over the next several months. In February 2024, the remaining critical investigators and law enforcement liaisons on Breeden’s central safety team were shown the door. Lawrie said group chats of former Match Group employees have been gossipping about the cutbacks. “You’re not gonna see them taking safety seriously ever again,” he said, adding that the only thing that he thinks might change that is legislation. Four months before Matthews was arrested, a post on a Facebook group in Denver blew up, right around Christmas. Over and over again, women furiously detailed negative experiences they or their friends had with Matthews. Some women described him as “sketchy.” Others called him “terrible” and “not safe.” Multiple women told a similar, dark story: that they were offered drinks, blacked out, and sexually assaulted. The thread reached 150 comments. Two women wrote the same thing: that they had been waiting for someone to post about the cardiologist. The flood of Facebook comments mirrored details in the police reports released the following year. Nearly all of the 16 women included in the district attorney’s initial complaints were offered tequila. Eight recalled playing Jenga. Six mentioned a hot tub. As these stories circulated in this small corner of the internet in December 2022, the Denver cardiologist stayed on Match Group apps. Those fortunate enough to know about the Facebook group — and who had the foresight to check for Matthews on it — would be saved from a bad date or worse. But the fact that he could still log into Tinder and Hinge left him with a pool of thousands of unsuspecting women whom he could — and would — continue to match with. The Dating Apps Reporting Project is aware of four additional women who have accused Matthews of drugging and/or raping them who were not part of the criminal complaint. Each of these women met Matthews on a Match Group app during a single year between the summers of 2020 and 2021. During the years Matthews was on their apps, Match Group hired and fired Breeden. It made loud promises on sexual violence, announced initiatives and product lines, and promised a transparency report. But it was not straight with the public, which meant the women matching with Matthews on Match Group apps were not aware of the risk they faced. Match Group’s partnership with Garbo, the background check company, also fell apart in the summer of 2023. “It’s become clear that most online platforms aren’t legitimately committed to trust and safety for their users,” Garbo wrote in a searing blog post. After spending so much energy talking about monetization, gamification, and growth, Kim began to publicly acknowledge this problem. Speaking at the Citibank conference in the fall of 2023, he said the company was investing in new features to make sure “women have a good experience while they’re in the product. They feel safe. They feel secure. Etc.” Privacy Internet-connected cars allow abusers to track domestic violence survivors after they leave The “etc.” does not seem to include increased transparency about safety. Instead, in May 2023, Tinder released a “female-focused package,” a curated list of “high-quality profiles.” It is unclear how Tinder determines these high-quality matches. Hinge’s Standout feature, which is similar, had previously promoted Matthews. In fact, under Kim’s leadership, all mentions of a transparency report disappeared from the company’s annual impact report. Ironically, this was around the same time that new legislation in Europe required tech companies to disclose reports of “non-consensual behavior” and other issues. Match Group will be required to submit a transparency report to the European Union on the scope of harm on their platforms later this month. Lawmakers in India and Australia are also demanding transparency. This is exactly the situation Breeden and her team pondered three years ago. “What if publishing in one jurisdiction sparks a requirement in another?” read a slide in the same internal presentation where Match Group’s trust-and-safety leaders wondered whether they should “push back on how much [they] are required to reveal.” After Match Group published a disappointing earnings report in February 2025 that fell below analysts’ expectations, it also announced that Kim would be replaced by former Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff. Tinder’s revenue, sales, and subscribers had all gone down. As Match Group struggles to reverse its decline, it’s also aware that its reputation is in the spotlight. Earnings calls and shareholder letters over the first three quarters of 2024 indicate that the company knows it is a business imperative to make women feel safer on its platforms. Match Group brought in a new vice president to head trust and safety whose job partly focuses on complying with increased global transparency requirements. The company is experimenting with requiring faces in photos and rolled out a “Share My Date” feature so you can be tracked while meeting up with an online stranger. On Tinder, it orchestrated a “major ecosystem cleanup” geared toward identifying fake profiles and getting scammers off the app. But neither the cleanup nor tracking a date from your phone would have stopped Matthews — a man who never sought to hide his identity, who assaulted his dates in his own home — from finding and harming women. Four years after Matthews’ first documented assault, he walked into a wood-paneled courtroom in Denver and was sentenced to 158 years to life in prison. “I will sentence. I cannot heal,” Judge Eric Johnson told the room filled with survivors and family members. “Countless women have suffered and will continue to suffer,” said Laura Wolf, an attorney who represented the woman whose police report triggered Matthews’ arrest. “Hinge and other dating platforms have taken no steps to ensure the safety of the product they are selling, matching unsuspecting women to known predators without pause or concern.” Match Group didn’t make it easy for the Denver prosecutors to convict Matthews. A search warrant was issued to Hinge in July 2023. Two months later, prosecutors were still empty-handed — with the judge in the case asking at a hearing if he needed to start “dragging people in to get stuff done.” It wasn’t until February 2024 that the Denver District Attorney’s Office said they finally received documents returned by Match Group. Matthews will likely never leave prison. Match Group executives currently face no charges. But the company knew about Matthews, and it knows about thousands of other abusive users. It has the data that could help users avoid dangerous situations, but it hasn’t shared it, leaving millions of people in the dark. Lawmakers around the world are starting to ask for answers from the most powerful force in modern dating. In June, Colorado passed a law, triggered by the Matthews case, that forces dating app companies to tell the state attorney general what safety measures they are taking to protect users. Although the law leaves room for the possibility of additional transparency in the future, it does not currently require the company to tell the state, or the public, how many people are raped or assaulted after using its platform. In the U.S., we’ve just scratched the surface. In most states, there’s little that requires Match Group to share information with you — or with Congress. The reality is that if Stephen Matthews were released today, he could get right back on a dating app. Match Group knows this — and now so do you. Stephanie Wolf contributed reporting. Statistical journalist Natasha Uzcátegui-Liggett led The Markup’s testing of Match Group apps. The Markup created more than 50 accounts across Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish to test how Match Group treats reports of sexual assault and whether users banned from Tinder after a reported sexual assault could return to Match Group apps by creating new accounts. We conducted experiments in April and May of 2024 and again in January and February of 2025. The results were similar across both rounds of testing.To start, The Markup tested if and how quickly Tinder would ban users who were reported for in-person behavior. We found that Tinder consistently banned reported users within two days of receiving a report.Next, we tested whether a banned Tinder user could use their exact same basic account information to sign up for other Match Group dating apps: Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish. Hinge and OkCupid prevented us from creating accounts, but Plenty of Fish allowed us to create new accounts. Within 48 hours, the Plenty of Fish accounts were taken down.Our next tests focused on identifying what type of changes would allow banned users to rejoin Tinder or create new accounts on other Match Group apps and use them like normal. To simulate what a typical user would try, The Markup utilized online guides and forums to identify commonly suggested techniques to get around a ban from a Match Group app. We then tried a combination of these suggestions, especially those that self-identified banned users claimed to have had success with. Across several rounds of testing, we found multiple ways to successfully create new Match Group accounts that bypassed the ban. Each method only involved simple changes in how we signed up and the information we provided during the process.When attempting to rejoin, or create a new account on another Match Group app, we used the normal sign up processes users go through and used the same phone as the original banned account. During multiple tests, we successfully created new accounts without needing to change the user’s name, birthday, or profile photos.The Markup did not test any methods that required significant technical knowledge and only utilized information that would be easily accessible to someone who did a cursory search of how to get around a ban. For example, The Markup did not test whether changing a profile photo’s metadata could alter the results. The Markup’s test accounts created for these experiments purposefully did not like, match with, or message any real Match Group users. — By Natasha Uzcátegui-Liggett Your donations power our award-winning reporting and our tools.

Title: High Electric Bills Are the Tip of the Iceberg

U.S. electric rates are going up. In Missouri, Ameren increased residential power bills by 11% less than two years ago, and now it is seeking another 15% increase, per the Public Service Commission (PSC). According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), rate increases were experienced in 43 American states between 2023 and 2024. The EIA also reported record rate increases between 2021 and 2024 projections. In California, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was granted six rate increases in 2024. Local ABC 30 Action News reported that The Utility Reform Network estimated that residents had experienced a $50 average increase to their bill before the last of these increases took effect. In New York City, Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change. BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc. are also the top shareholders of Con Edison, PG&E, and the WEC Energy Group. American Electric Power is the parent company of various local electric companies that serve Americans living in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. According to the Nasdaq, this parent company’s top shareholders are Vanguard Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. as well. When cross-referencing every electric company that is a member of the Edison Electric Institute, one pattern is easily recognized: BlackRock and Vanguard are the top shareholders of the majority of American electric companies. And like their shareholders, these energy companies support the business of “clean energy.” Ameren, Con Edison, PG&E, WEC Energy, and American Electric Power have all committed to “clean energy” solutions, without offering a long-term plan on how these sources will be maintained for the future. “Clean Energy” waste has yet to be addressed by companies investing in “renewables.” It is a new concept even for the United States Environmental Protection Agency. On their website they note that “some end-of-life solar panels contain enough metals, like lead, to meet the definition of hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.” The EPA website also notes the need to update standards for lithium-ion solar battery waste, because “though lithium batteries are generally safe when used, stored, and charged appropriately, these batteries can cause fires when improperly discarded or otherwise mismanaged at the end of their lives.” The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), a division of the American Chemical Society, estimated in 2022 that just 5% of lithium-ion batteries were recycled, adding yet another waste problem for “clean energy.” Add in ecosystem disruption and wildlife loss, and “clean energy” waste is growing into a big problem. Unfortunately, solar power especially has another dirty record: according to the Heritage Foundation, “Roughly 80% of solar components are manufactured in China using slave labor.” Even the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of International Labor Affairs states on its website, “Nearly half of the world’s polysilicon, a key material used to produce solar panels, comes from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR or Xinjiang), a region of China where members of ethnic and religious minority groups are forced by the government to work against their will.” What’s more, Congress held a hearing exploring China’s role in enslaving children and other people in the Democratic Republic of Congo to mine cobalt, a key element in creating lithium-ion batteries. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) highlighted key points of the hearing: Around 70% of the world’s cobalt supply comes from the DRC, and 41% of all batteries containing cobalt are imported from the People’s Republic of China. CECC chairman Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) stated, “From dirt to battery, from cobalt to cars, the entire system is fueled by violence, cruelty, and corruption. ... By ignoring these rights and by treating people including children as expendable, China is committing gross violations of human rights and is seeking to rewrite the international order.” Journalist Stavros Nicolas Niarchos testified, “I have seen how landscapes have been destroyed, water polluted and air filled with dust and carbon as mining companies rush to extract minerals like copper, cobalt, lithium, and phosphates. Oftentimes, human rights abuses go hand in glove with these environmental catastrophes. ... We must also not forget the very real human rights abuses that attend the extraction of battery metals in the DRC. Children are brutalized, women are violated, and men are subject to wage slavery.” “Clean energy” investments and human rights violations surrounding Chinese industry are undeniable, and top American energy investors BlackRock and Vanguard are no strangers to China. In 2023, BlackRock and another global investment company, MSCI, were investigated by the House Select Committee on the CCP and found to have profited from “fueling China’s military.” The committee noted, “BlackRock and MSCI invest or enable the investment of Americans' savings into dozens of blacklisted Chinese companies that threaten US national security or support the Chinese Communist Party's human rights abuses.” Last year, the House Select Committee on the CCP reported that BlackRock had invested at least $1.9 billion in red-flagged and blacklisted companies that fund the military capabilities of the People’s Republic of China and aid its human rights violations. The Coalition for a Prosperous America released a Case Study in 2023, which reported that Vanguard and another investment company, FTSE Russell, invested billions in the CCP. The report found that Vanguard specifically funded dozens of Chinese military subsidiaries and eight Chinese companies that had been blacklisted due to their violations of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). The top shareholders of publicly traded American energy companies have been linked to funding the nation’s largest adversary and its human rights violations. Meanwhile, Americans have been unknowingly footing the bill. But there is another way. Electric Co-Ops are being formed all over the nation. These give residents the power. Instead of publicly trading American energy to any globalist CCP-supporting hedge fund, co-ops are owned by the residents who pay into them. No globalist interference, no slave labor products. Right now, most of us have only a single electricity option, and these publicly traded monopolies are working against us. But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can form more energy co-ops and escape the technocratic globalists preying on publicly traded electric companies, and we can power our homes our way without compromising American values.

Unfortunately, solar power especially has another dirty record: according to the Heritage Foundation, “Roughly 80% of solar components are manufactured in China using slave labor.” Even the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of International Labor Affairs states on its website, “Nearly half of the world’s polysilicon, a key material used to produce solar panels, comes from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR or Xinjiang), a region of China where members of ethnic and religious minority groups are forced by the government to work against their will.” What’s more, Congress held a hearing exploring China’s role in enslaving children and other people in the Democratic Republic of Congo to mine cobalt, a key element in creating lithium-ion batteries. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) highlighted key points of the hearing: “Clean energy” investments and human rights violations surrounding Chinese industry are undeniable, and top American energy investors BlackRock and Vanguard are no strangers to China. In 2023, BlackRock and another global investment company, MSCI, were investigated by the House Select Committee on the CCP and found to have profited from “fueling China’s military.” The committee noted, “BlackRock and MSCI invest or enable the investment of Americans' savings into dozens of blacklisted Chinese companies that threaten US national security or support the Chinese Communist Party's human rights abuses.” Last year, the House Select Committee on the CCP reported that BlackRock had invested at least $1.9 billion in red-flagged and blacklisted companies that fund the military capabilities of the People’s Republic of China and aid its human rights violations. The Coalition for a Prosperous America released a Case Study in 2023, which reported that Vanguard and another investment company, FTSE Russell, invested billions in the CCP. The report found that Vanguard specifically funded dozens of Chinese military subsidiaries and eight Chinese companies that had been blacklisted due to their violations of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). The top shareholders of publicly traded American energy companies have been linked to funding the nation’s largest adversary and its human rights violations. Meanwhile, Americans have been unknowingly footing the bill. But there is another way. Electric Co-Ops are being formed all over the nation. These give residents the power. Instead of publicly trading American energy to any globalist CCP-supporting hedge fund, co-ops are owned by the residents who pay into them. No globalist interference, no slave labor products. Right now, most of us have only a single electricity option, and these publicly traded monopolies are working against us. But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can form more energy co-ops and escape the technocratic globalists preying on publicly traded electric companies, and we can power our homes our way without compromising American values.

For me, the best of them was OpenAI’s black and white homage to the pixel. It’s graphic. It’s surprising. It arouses curiosity. I had no idea it was an ad for OpenAI until the end. Let’s ridicule and humiliate pretentious snobs who like art. Meta brought in Kingsman director Matthew Vaughan to direct movie stars Chris Pratt and Chris Hemsworth, who play clueless, accidental art gallery vandals. The movie stars are the stars of these spots, instead of the product, which is good and deserves better.

Screen capture of a dramatic moment in Kavan Cardoza's short Star Wars fan film. The Best Star Wars Movie in Years is Made With AI. Filmmaker Kavan Cardoza, who goes by his social media handle, Kavan the Kid, has released The Ghost’s Apprentice, a stunning AI-generated Star Wars fan film. Using Google Veo, Midjourney, and Runway, he created the 11.5-minute short in just 14 days, pushing AI tools to their limits. His previous AI-generated Batman short drew Warner Bros.’ legal attention, and Star Wars may follow suit. But instead of shutting him down, Hollywood should be learning from him. Cardoza’s Phantom X studio is already attracting interest from major brands and studios. This is scary. “In this latest AI short film/vignette,” says filmmaker Davide Bianca of Shifting Tides, “I wanted to experiment with the idea of building tension through silence, and see if I could create something truly eerie and unsettling, not through jump scares or heavy exposition, but through subtle characterization and minimal dialogue.” Extensive performance capture was done with Runway Gen3 Act 1 and an iPhone, and prompted performance in Kling 1.6, to create a sense of heightened awareness between the characters. Every glance, every subtle movement, and every moment of stillness had to carry weight. The challenge was to make the characters feel hyper-aware of each other without relying on excessive dialogue.” This column is also a podcast hosted by its author, Charlie Fink, Ted Schilowitz, former studio executive and co-founder of Red Camera, and Rony Abovitz, founder of Magic Leap.

Title: Franklin Templeton’s money market fund launches on Solana – Is BlackRock losing ground?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/franklin-templetons-money-market-fund-launches-on-solana-is-blackrock-losing-ground/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T03:00:40Z

With $1.6 trillion under management, why is Franklin Templeton doubling down on blockchain? Franklin Templeton has expanded its tokenized money market fund, Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX), to the Solana [SOL] blockchain, further strengthening its presence in the digital asset space. With $1.6 trillion in assets under management, the firm announced this move on the 12th of February, building on FOBXX’s multi-chain strategy. Originally launched in 2021, the fund has already integrated with Ethereum [ETH], Coinbase’s Base, Aptos [APT], and Avalanche [AVAX], while Stellar [XLM] remains its primary blockchain. Thus, as the third-largest tokenized money market fund, FOBXX is nearing a total asset value of $600 million, highlighting its growing adoption. Additionally, it also holds the distinction of being the world’s first mutual fund to leverage blockchain technology for transaction processing and share ownership recording, with each share represented by a BENJI token. Remarking on the same, Franklin Templeton took to X (formerly Twitter) and said, “New chain unlocked. BENJI is now live on solana! Solana is a fast, secure and censorship resistant Layer 1 blockchain encouraging global adoption via its open infrastructure.” Needless to say, institutional interest in the Solana network has been on the rise, signaling a shift beyond its reputation as a hub for memecoins. In Q3 2024, investments in decentralized applications built on SOL surged by 54%, reaching $173 million, reflecting growing confidence among wealth managers and hedge funds. The token itself has staged a remarkable recovery from the bear market lows of under $10 following FTX’s collapse. It recently hit a 52-week high of $265.10, partly fueled by excitement surrounding former U.S. President Donald Trump’s memecoin launch on the network. Additionally, Solana has emerged as the dominant platform for launching new tokens, particularly within decentralized trading. A report from Pantera Capital revealed that SOL now accounts for over 90% of new tokens listed on decentralized exchanges—an extraordinary jump from just 1% at the end of 2023. Echoing similar sentiments, Cosmo Jiang and Eric Wallach in the same report noted, “Even when innovation doesn’t start on Solana, it eventually finds its way there.” However, as the firm strengthens its foothold, it faces growing competition from BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which has surged past Franklin’s BENJI token in market capitalization, reaching $637 million. With tokenized treasury products now totaling $3.6 billion, the race for dominance in this emerging sector is intensifying. Beyond its money market fund, Franklin Templeton has been actively expanding its crypto offerings, launching Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs while seeking SEC approval for a Crypto Index ETF. Its latest move—a Delaware-based trust linked to a Solana ETF—further highlights its strategic push into blockchain-based investment products. Therefore, as institutions embrace tokenized assets, Franklin Templeton’s innovation could help shape the future of digital finance.

Title: Gainey McKenna & Egleston Announces A Class Action Lawsuit Has Been Filed Against Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK)

Time Published: 2025-02-13T21:28:00Z

February 13, 2025 16:28 ET | Source: Gainey McKenna & Egleston Gainey McKenna & Egleston NEW YORK, Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gainey McKenna & Egleston announces that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for the Company’s investors under the federal securities laws. According to the Complaint, Defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. The Complaint alleges that Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The Complaint alleges that defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. The Complaint further alleges that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. The Complaint also alleges that investors began to question the truth of Defendants’ public statements on July 30, 2024, during Merck’s earnings call following a same day press release announcing its second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings. The Complaint alleges that in pertinent part, Defendants announced a significant reduction in Gardasil vaccinations, resulting in inventory levels at Merck’s distributor in China to climb above normal levels. The Complaint further alleges that as a result, Defendants announced that its shipments of Gardasil to China may fall below contracted levels for 2024, yet they remained confident in their long-term projections both in the region and globally. According to the Complaint the full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” The Complaint alleges that Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” The Complaint further alleges that investors and analysts again reacted promptly to Merk’s revelations. The Complaint alleges that the price of Merck’s common stock declined dramatically, from a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day. Investors who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of Merck should contact the Firm prior to the April 14, 2025 lead plaintiff motion deadline.

Title: Arm is making its first chip — with Meta already waiting in line

Arm (SFTBY) is reportedly making its first chip — and counting on Meta (META) to be one of its first customers. The British chip designer could launch its first in-house chip by the summer, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Producing its own chip would be a massive change to Arm’s business of licensing its chip designs to companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). Masayoshi Son, the founder of Arm’s majority owner, SoftBank Group, reportedly wants Arm to move into chip production as part of a larger plan for artificial intelligence infrastructure, according to the Financial Times. The Arm chip will be a central processing unit, or CPU, for large data center servers, and will be customizable for Meta and other customers, people told the Financial Times. This could put Arm in competition with Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which produce most of the server chips for Big Tech companies. In May, Nikkei Asia reported that Arm is putting together an AI chip unit, with plans to launch a prototype by spring of this year, and mass produce chips by the fall. Arm declined to comment. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Son involved in the half-a-trillion-dollar U.S. AI infrastructure plan, Stargate, alongside OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman and Oracle (ORCL) chief technology officer Larry Ellison. SoftBank and OpenAI are co-leading the project, with SoftBank taking financial responsibility and OpenAI overseeing operations. Son will be Stargate’s chairman. The new venture “intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States,” the AI startup said in a statement. Stargate is starting with an initial $100 billion investment, counting OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and Abu Dhabi-based AI investor MGX as initial equity funders.

Intel (INTC) shares jumped Thursday, extending their recent rally on speculation of a deal with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). The storied chipmaker has been the subject of discussions involving a potential U.S. chipmaking partnership with TSMC, Baird analysts said Wednesday. TSMC could send engineers to Intel’s foundry business as part of such a venture, and potentially launch a new entity jointly owned by TSMC and Intel that could benefit from U.S. government funding under the Chips Act, the analysts said. Intel’s foundry business has struggled to keep up with TSMC, losing $13.4 billion in 2024. A TSMC spokesperson declined to remark on such a deal, while Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The discussions come as Vice President JD Vance said Tuesday the Trump administration wants artificial intelligence chips to be designed and manufactured domestically. Policies favoring U.S. chip manufacturers could benefit Intel’s foundry, which makes chips in the U.S. for third parties. Shares of Intel popped over 9% to $24.52 in Thursday afternoon trading and have gained nearly 30% so far this week. However, even with recent gains, the stock is down more than 40% over the past 12 months.

Title: The Putin-Trump call was a true turning point

By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory The only thing more dangerous than being America’s enemy is to be its friend. That is a statement often attributed to Henry Kissinger – the multiple, unrepentant as well as un-prosecuted war criminal, butcher of the Global South, and revelation-resistant icon of US foreign policy. And even if the sources are a little murky – involving the slightly deranged and badly overestimated arch-conservative grandstander William F. Buckley – it would have been just like bad old Henry: sort of witty, deeply malevolent, and yet realistic in its own, venomous way. Never mind that the idea is not that original: Aleksey Vandam, an unjustly forgotten geopolitical theorist and general of the late Russian empire, knew that much already. Watching the British and Americans abuse China, Vandam felt the Chinese had every reason for concluding that “it’s a bad thing to have an Anglo-Saxon for an enemy, but God forbid having him as a friend.” And yet some lessons are never learned. This time it is the turn of both Ukraine and America’s EU-NATO vassals to pay the price of trying to be friends with what, in a global perspective, has been – quite objectively, quantifiably – the most overbearing, violent, and disruptive empire of firstly, the post-World War II and, recently, the post-Cold War periods. Because that is one of the key messages of the increasingly intense – and now, finally, open – top level contacts between Moscow and Washington, that is, between presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. Let’s be clear: This is, in and of itself, a positive and badly overdue development. The recent, officially confirmed “lengthy and highly productive phone call” (Trump’s words) between the two leaders may not yet amount to a breakthrough. Even if Trump’s rhetoric – about a “successful conclusion, hopefully soon!” – already makes it look like one; Trump, it’s true, can be grandiloquent. Yet the conversation does already serve as a big, heavy slab of a tombstone on America’s absurd and very dangerous policy of decrepitly stubborn non-communication. Moreover, Moscow has now confirmed that a full summit is in the making. Even better, we also know already that neither Kiev nor the EU-NATO vassals were in the loop: There goes the daft, devious, and very deadly (for Ukrainians, too) mantra of “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” And as a bonus: Soon there will be a lot about EU-NATO Europe without Europe. The fact that its leaders are, in the Financial Times’s words, “reel[ing]” and already clamoring for being heard merely confirms that they have been shunted aside. Rest assured: whatever cosmetic role the Europeans may be allowed to play (or not), they are delusional if they think they’ll matter. In reality, the Trumpists are brutally frank about what they have in mind for their underlings: Washington and Moscow make the decisions, the NATO-EU vassals fall in line and, also, pay for the outcome: Reconstructing Ukraine, Trump’s people feel, is for European budgets. And if – a big if, given Moscow’s objections – any Western troops somehow end up stationed in what will be left of Ukraine, then those too will be Europe’s very bad business to take care of as well. Let’s be frank: Both steps look harsh, but they are necessary. In the case of Ukraine, its leadership needs to be deprived of its implied veto power over peace. Because, first, that power is not real anyhow. It has always served as a smokescreen to allow warmongers in the West – recall Boris Johnson, anyone? – to sell their proxy war as the “will of Ukraine,” while Ukrainians have been used up as cannon fodder. Second, since the Ukraine War has long been a war involving – and putting at risk – all of Ukraine’s Western sponsors as well, it is obviously unjust that their populations’ security should not matter as long as a US puppet regime in Kiev doesn’t feel like peace. Third, Ukraine is not the same as that regime. Ever more of its people want a compromise end to this war, as polls have been showing for almost a year already. The regime’s superannuated, detached, and ever less popular leader Vladimir Zelensky and his team of slick operators and clumsy sycophants have no right to stand in their nation’s way. Regarding NATO, the EU and Europe: Apart from getting the acid disrespect they richly deserve for allowing the US and/or Ukraine to blow up their vital infrastructure, Europe’s spineless leaders have made it abundantly clear that the best thing they can do for world peace and international stability is to have no say. The antics of Kaja Kallas, the overpromoted simpleton who counts for the EU’s de facto foreign minister, are just the latest proof of that fact. And let’s not even start on Baerbock, Lammy, Macron, Starmer, von der Leyen… The list of war-besotted incompetents and “Atlanticist” sell-outs goes on and on. It’s not as if there had never been alternatives: remember what happened when Viktor Orbán, leader of bona fide EU and NATO member Hungary, tried to revive some diplomacy on behalf of Europe last summer? The Brussels gang went into an almost indecent panic attack, disavowing all such uncouth ideas: Diplomacy?!? Not on our watch! Well, what’s left to say now? You didn’t want talks with Orbán, now you’ll get freezing-out with Trump. Slow claps all around, once again. I am a European; I wished it were different. But reality remains reality: Unless NATO-EU Europe’s “elites” either grow up (very unlikely) or are replaced (if only), they should be left out of serious international politics. It’s better and safer for everyone, including their own countries. As things seem to be shaping up now, the US has signaled that it is ready to accept crucial Russian war aims: Ukraine will not get into NATO and Moscow will retain territories conquered during the war, as Trump’s secretary of defense Pete Hegseth has made clear. Both points, it is true, require serious elaboration: Moscow has been explicit for years that it will not agree to any settlement that leaves open the possibility of a “sneak”-NATO membership for Ukraine, where the West’s war alliance arms, trains, and equips but without formal membership, as it has already done. If anyone in Washington – or somewhere in Europe, for that matter – still thinks they can cheat, again, Russia will keep fighting. A Russian red line is a red line is a red line. And don’t forget: the West has zero credibility left. After three decades of massive post-Cold War bad faith and trickery over one issue after another, from NATO expansion, via the rights of Russian-speakers in the Baltics and Libya’s destruction, to that of Syria – to name only a few examples – no one in Washington should assume they can have anything from Russia simply by saying “but we are different.” Art of the deal here, art of the deal there: This time, only hard-headed, verifiable quid-pro-quos will even be on the table. As ancient-history American uber-cold warrior and – weirdly enough, sort of co-peacemaker, in the end – Ronald Reagan once said in execrably pronounced but brave Russian: doveriai, no proveriai (доверяй, но проверяй): Trust but verify. Now it’s Americans who will get to hear that a lot and in proper Russian: if there will ever be a time again for trust, the West will have to earn it first. Concerning territory, only negotiations can clear up details. Yet, while there may or may not be some flexibility in Moscow, all Western and Ukrainian interlocutors should avoid getting up their hopes: This war has been costly for Russia, too; and whether its opponents and critics like it or not, it is winning. These two facts will translate into hard limits to Moscow’s flexibility on territory as well. Where exactly they are, remains to be seen. Trying to disregard them is a recipe for further or renewed war. This rapprochement in the still crucial US-Russian relationship is a very important development. That much is already certain. It was not unpredictable. Trump’s campaign statements, his overall sense of the world, and even his temperament made it more likely than not. But it could also not have happened: Washington hardliners, who are not extinct or powerless, might have nipped it in the bud. Indeed, they may still succeed. Nothing will be certain before an agreement is not only signed but also fully implemented in good faith (unlike Minsk-2 of sad 2015 fame, yet another agreement that the West – and Kiev – systematically betrayed). Yet let’s not overlook two important things that are already clear: As I have pointed out before, it is a fact now that Russia has defeated the West, in the simple sense that it is Moscow that is now imposing its terms on the war’s settlement; and the West’s leaders in Washington have now de facto acknowledged this outcome. While the West has fought Russia through Ukraine, its investment in treasure (including through self-damaging economic warfare), arms, intelligence, unofficial fighters, political support, and, last but not least, excessive rhetorical commitment is amply sufficient to make this a painful Western defeat, not “merely” a Ukrainian one. And that is how it will be perceived by the world, too. Trying to “take out” a resurgent Russia was always a predictably bad idea. Allow me, for once, to quote myself. As I wrote in December 2021, before the escalation of February 2022, a “major change in how the West and Russia relate to each other” was “inevitable” then already, because “sometime between, say, 2008 and 2014, the post-Cold War era has ended, and we are now in a post-post-Cold War world. It is this tectonic shift, Russia’s come-back, far from perfect yet substantial, that fundamentally drives the need for a geopolitical re-adjustment. The latter can happen in a deliberate and negotiated manner, or the movers and shakers of the West, first of all the US, can decide to let geopolitical nature take its course. The second course of, as it were, malign negligence would lead to a much bumpier ride to a new status quo, quite possibly with catastrophic effects.” It is that “much bumpier ride” that, hopefully is coming to an end now – at least for a while – and the result is in: The West has tried and failed to stop Russia; the West has gambled recklessly and lost. Russia is now stronger than before that Western failure, and the West is weaker. Because weakness and strength are always relative, as Thomas Hobbes, past master of realism and pessimism told us a long time ago. And here is the second thing that is already clear: The West is not one thing. While it is dominated by the US, its European vassals will suffer much worse from this historic setback. They could have stymied the American war course. If even one major European NATO state (France, Germany, Britain…) had come out and struck a deal with Moscow to never allow Ukraine into NATO, that state would have surely been punished by Washington, but the war could have been avoided. Because every individual NATO member has, in effect, veto power on new admissions. In an ideal scenario, the hapless vassals could even have banded together and rebelled against their risk-addicted lords in Washington. But they chose complete submission instead. Now they have only two options: Try to continue the proxy war on their own – if there will be a Kiev regime left to collaborate with – in which case the US will watch from the sidelines as they are being ground up. (No, NATO, that is, the US will not help… duh). Or they can give up and try to navigate their defeat by Moscow and abandonment by Washington as best they can through trying to mend ties with Russia. Their economies, in urgent need of rescue, would benefit, as stock market reactions to the recent developments signal. For their own sake, the European “elites” should finally return to reality.

Title: Silicon Valley Software Engineers Horrified as They Can't Easily Find Jobs Anymore

Back in 2021, the tech industry was booming. Fueled by generous government subsidies and the pandemic economy, tech companies went on a hiring spree, promising unlimited time off and upward growth opportunities at open offices where kombucha and cold brew flowed from taps. Flash forward to now, and those taps have run dry. A seemingly endless wave of mass layoffs is ravaging the tech industry as startup fails skyrocket and tech giants shovel their operating budgets into the AI furnace. And of all the workers devastated by the carnage, former tech workers in Silicon Valley are having a particularly rough go of it. The region's former software engineers and developers — whose jobs were previously thought to be ironclad — are now having to contend with a fiercely competitive job market in one of the most expensive housing markets in the world. Many, like former Indeed managing engineer Daelynn Moyer, are considering leaving the industry altogether. The 55 year old life-long tech worker told the Washington Post that she's considering selling her house and retiring early to a farm, after 160 job applications went nowhere. "It would be a meager existence, but it would be fulfilling," Moyer told the paper. "I would no longer feel like a no longer useful commodity." Moyer isn't alone — industry events are becoming desperate job fairs full of unemployed tech workers sick of rejection emails. Many have taken to social media to share the misery of the job hunt with the growing mass of erstwhile tech workers. "I'm looking to move on from tech," commented one Reddit account on a thread about layoffs. "I am burned out on the lengthy interview process and then the rejections. It has done some damage to me physiologically." Another posted "lessons learned from my tech layoff," saying "I did not know who I was after I got laid off. I looked at myself in the mirror and I could not introduce myself to me. I regret caring so much about 'shareholder value.'" Unfortunately for American tech workers, the layoff train isn't slowing down. Yesterday, Meta kicked off "thousands of layoffs," amounting to roughly 5 percent of its staff, some of whom CEO Mark Zuckerberg has vowed to replace with AI systems. And last week, Google offered workers severance in exchange for taking a voluntary layoff, signaling its intention to clamp down on its already consolidated hardware department, which had experienced hundreds of layoffs in spring of last year. While layoffs are becoming ubiquitous to all layers of tech, they're particularly insidious coming from the magnificent seven — stock-trader parlance for the tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Google (Alphabet), Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon, and Meta — which together are worth more than the stock markets of the UK, Canada, Germany, and France combined, or more than China's entire stock market, which is the second largest in the history of the world. Put it all together, and an industry that was just recently on top of the world is feeling some serious crunch. And while it's currently the rank-and-file taking the brunt, it remains to be seen how deep the cuts will go — especially because the tech sector, for now, seems hell-bent on pouring money into artificial intelligence.

Title: 7 Attractive Sectors For Growth Stocks In The Next Decade
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/top-sectors-growth-stocks-next-decade/
Time Published: 2025-02-13T18:55:39Z

A truly promising growth sector is one that not only remains relevant in the face of change and ... [+] challenge but is also strategically positioned to capitalize on future innovations and evolving market demands. Investors are always on the lookout for the next Google, Nvidia or Amazon – game-changers that disrupt industries and deliver substantial returns. To identify the right growth investments it’s essential to focus on sectors with transformative growth potential, as sustainable growth goes beyond rapid expansion. It involves positioning for innovation, resilience to economic cycles, and the ability to navigate constantly-evolving global events. This analysis explores key sectors poised for growth over the next decade, based on emerging technologies, market trends, regulatory changes and investment activity. A sector is positioned for growth when it demonstrates the following: The sectors mentioned below are likely to experience transformative growth over the next decade. The revenue and growth numbers cited below are from McKinsey. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will drive the growth narrative forward over the next decade. This is reinforced by a decisive shift in U.S. AI policy, with President Trump announcing a $500 billion AI infrastructure project dubbed “Stargate” to build data centers and computing infrastructure for AI development. The AI market is estimated to top trillion dollars in value by 2030, up from $197 billion in 2023. Consulting firm McKinsey estimates that AI software and services alone could contribute up to $23 trillion in annual economic value by 2040. For perspective, the U.S. GDP was around $29 trillion for the third quarter of 2024. With GDP typically growing at a rate of 2.5-3% annually, AI’s potential to accelerate growth lies in its ability to boost productivity, accelerate product development and shorten innovation cycles. AI will not only stimulate industry expansion but also fuel consumer demand through improved personalization. Catalysts for AI growth include advancements in machine learning and deep learning, as well as breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing (NLP). AI will fuel automation, revolutionize healthcare by reducing costs, enable autonomous vehicle systems, and drive personalization across industries. The expansion of cloud and edge computing will further accelerate AI adoption. Nvidia (NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) appear well positioned to capture the growing investments in AI. Despite the DeepSeek-triggered sell-off, Nvidia is powered by a strong AI ecosystem that will provide sustained growth for the long-term. Despite the rapid growth over the past decade, cloud services have plenty of untapped potential due to under penetration of the market. Even as businesses continue to shift from traditional computing and storage models to cloud-based solutions, a 2023 survey found that enterprises with annual revenues topping $1 billion had only around 20% of their workloads currently hosted in the cloud. However, the majority of these companies plan to more than double this share by 2026. The ability to bring compelling value to enterprises migrating to the cloud should continue to drive growth in cloud services over the next decade. According to McKinsey, cloud services are projected to generate $3 trillion in EBITDA increases for Forbes Global 2000 companies by 2030, by digitizing core operation, and accelerating product development. This clearly represents a value proposition. Cloud services revenues are projected to increase from $220 billion in 2022 to between $1.6 trillion and $3.4 trillion by 2040. Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the top cloud infrastructure provider, though Microsoft is gaining ground, especially in the enterprise sector. Apple is currently using AWS’s custom AI chips to handle search services, and is evaluating if it can use Amazon’s newest AI chip to pre-train Apple Intelligence models. The health care sector is teeming with growth prospects, thanks to the quest for better treatments and more affordable patient care. From developing treatments to streamlining administrative tasks in hospitals, AI will play a crucial role in shaping the health care sector. The multi-pronged growth in the health care sector would include advancements in telemedicine and remote healthcare (virtual consultations and remote patient monitoring), personalized and precision medicine (tailored treatments based on genetic data, lifestyle and environmental factors), health monitoring and proactive care via wearables, gene editing (technologies to alter genes within living organisms to cure genetic diseases and enhance biological traits – a slightly controversial area requiring stringent regulations and ethical considerations but brimming with explosive potential), digital health data platforms, and regenerative medicine that holds the promise of healing, replacing or regenerating tissues and organs rather than just managing diseases – but also requires careful regulatory navigation. Eli Lilly (LLY) has a blockbuster weight-loss drug in the works. Eli Lilly’s retatrutide has demonstrated impressive results in clinical trials with patients shedding roughly 25% of their body weight in just a year. In the near-term, implying as early as 2026, Lilly’s oral weight loss drug orforglipron may hit the markets. Orforglipron aims to match Novo Nordisk's Ozempic in effectiveness but without the need for injections and refrigeration. If phase three trials succeed, orforglipron could cater to the needle-phobic while unlocking a huge daily weight-loss pill market for Eli Lilly. The growth in e-commerce will be tied to immersive shopping experiences, growing internet penetration in emerging nations and category expansion in developed nations. Retail e-commerce (including food e-commerce) reported revenues of $4 trillion for 2022 or around 24% of global retail revenues. This is estimated to grow to $14-to-$20 trillion or 34%-to-47% of global retail sales by 2040. Retail e-commerce will continue to grow in emerging economies, such as Latin America, Asia and Africa as internet adoption rises in these regions amid expansion of the middle class. In 2022, retail E-Commerce represented just 12% of total retail sales in Latin America, 4% in the Middle East, and 2% in Africa. By 2040, e-commerce is estimated to account for 26% to 29% of total retail sales in Latin America, 15% to 20% in the Middle East, and 10% to 15% in Africa. For shoppers seeking hands-on-experience and enhanced product visualization, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) integrated into the shopping experience will be powerful tools for making informed buying decisions. Other enablers include AI-driven personalized shopping recommendations, influencer and review-oriented social commerce (which allows direct shopping through social media apps), and omnichannel retailing (or the increasing convergence of online and offline channels like ordering online and pickup in store). Quicker and cheaper shipping could also be a key catalyst. Shopify could be a good bet amid the continued global growth in e-commerce, as it supports businesses in setting up online stores and selling products online. The digital payments landscape will get a boost from globalization, increased smartphone usage, e-commerce growth and online shopping. Wide adoption of digital wallets like Google Pay clearly indicate consumer preference for convenient, fast, seamless and secure digital payment solutions. Financial inclusion will act as a major catalyst, especially in regions with limited or without traditional banking infrastructure. Cross-border transactions will further accelerate the adoption of digital payments, amid an increasing number of businesses having an international presence and consumers shopping internationally. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) will significantly automate digital payments. IoT-enabled devices, such as smart appliances, wearables, connected vehicles and even smart homes, will be capable of initiating payments autonomously. For instance, a car could automatically process payment for fuel at the gas station, or a refrigerator could place and pay for grocery orders when it detects that supplies are running low. Visa’s (V) scale, solid brand image and ability to adapt to new trends like contactless payments, mobile wallets and blockchain technology render it attractive in the digital payments space. Cybersecurity is set to evolve from a reactive to a proactive function over the next decade, as organizations strive to safeguard their data, assets and reputation from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, as digital transactions grow and transform exponentially. The cybersecurity industry’s revenues are estimated to grow from $160 billion in 2022 to $590 billion to $1.2 trillion by 2040. The share of all IT spending devoted to cybersecurity could grow from 6% in 2022 to an estimated range of 7% to 14% by 2040. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) uses AI in its solutions, and its big push into “platformization” – encouraging customers to adopt a unified platform for all cybersecurity requirements – appears to be paying off. Palo Alto’s next-generation security (NGS) annualized recurring revenue (ARR) grew 40% to $4.5 billion, of which 53% came from customers that adopted platformization. The company targets 2,500-3,500 platformization deals by fiscal 2030 from 1,100 at the end of the first-quarter of 2025. Agritech, which focuses on developing smarter and more sustainable food production solutions, is poised for significant growth over the next decade. This growth will be driven by the confluence of powerful trends, including the surge in global food demand fueled by a rapidly growing population, and the urgent need for innovative farming techniques to reduce waste, conserve water and minimize environmental footprints in the face of climate change and resource depletion.

Title: 7 Attractive Sectors For Growth Stocks In The Next Decade

A truly promising growth sector is one that not only remains relevant in the face of change and ... [+] challenge but is also strategically positioned to capitalize on future innovations and evolving market demands. Investors are always on the lookout for the next Google, Nvidia or Amazon – game-changers that disrupt industries and deliver substantial returns. To identify the right growth investments it’s essential to focus on sectors with transformative growth potential, as sustainable growth goes beyond rapid expansion. It involves positioning for innovation, resilience to economic cycles, and the ability to navigate constantly-evolving global events. This analysis explores key sectors poised for growth over the next decade, based on emerging technologies, market trends, regulatory changes and investment activity. A sector is positioned for growth when it demonstrates the following: The sectors mentioned below are likely to experience transformative growth over the next decade. The revenue and growth numbers cited below are from McKinsey. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will drive the growth narrative forward over the next decade. This is reinforced by a decisive shift in U.S. AI policy, with President Trump announcing a $500 billion AI infrastructure project dubbed “Stargate” to build data centers and computing infrastructure for AI development. The AI market is estimated to top trillion dollars in value by 2030, up from $197 billion in 2023. Consulting firm McKinsey estimates that AI software and services alone could contribute up to $23 trillion in annual economic value by 2040. For perspective, the U.S. GDP was around $29 trillion for the third quarter of 2024. With GDP typically growing at a rate of 2.5-3% annually, AI’s potential to accelerate growth lies in its ability to boost productivity, accelerate product development and shorten innovation cycles. AI will not only stimulate industry expansion but also fuel consumer demand through improved personalization. Catalysts for AI growth include advancements in machine learning and deep learning, as well as breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing (NLP). AI will fuel automation, revolutionize healthcare by reducing costs, enable autonomous vehicle systems, and drive personalization across industries. The expansion of cloud and edge computing will further accelerate AI adoption. Nvidia (NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) appear well positioned to capture the growing investments in AI. Despite the DeepSeek-triggered sell-off, Nvidia is powered by a strong AI ecosystem that will provide sustained growth for the long-term. Despite the rapid growth over the past decade, cloud services have plenty of untapped potential due to under penetration of the market. Even as businesses continue to shift from traditional computing and storage models to cloud-based solutions, a 2023 survey found that enterprises with annual revenues topping $1 billion had only around 20% of their workloads currently hosted in the cloud. However, the majority of these companies plan to more than double this share by 2026. The ability to bring compelling value to enterprises migrating to the cloud should continue to drive growth in cloud services over the next decade. According to McKinsey, cloud services are projected to generate $3 trillion in EBITDA increases for Forbes Global 2000 companies by 2030, by digitizing core operation, and accelerating product development. This clearly represents a value proposition. Cloud services revenues are projected to increase from $220 billion in 2022 to between $1.6 trillion and $3.4 trillion by 2040. Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the top cloud infrastructure provider, though Microsoft is gaining ground, especially in the enterprise sector. Apple is currently using AWS’s custom AI chips to handle search services, and is evaluating if it can use Amazon’s newest AI chip to pre-train Apple Intelligence models. The health care sector is teeming with growth prospects, thanks to the quest for better treatments and more affordable patient care. From developing treatments to streamlining administrative tasks in hospitals, AI will play a crucial role in shaping the health care sector. The multi-pronged growth in the health care sector would include advancements in telemedicine and remote healthcare (virtual consultations and remote patient monitoring), personalized and precision medicine (tailored treatments based on genetic data, lifestyle and environmental factors), health monitoring and proactive care via wearables, gene editing (technologies to alter genes within living organisms to cure genetic diseases and enhance biological traits – a slightly controversial area requiring stringent regulations and ethical considerations but brimming with explosive potential), digital health data platforms, and regenerative medicine that holds the promise of healing, replacing or regenerating tissues and organs rather than just managing diseases – but also requires careful regulatory navigation. Eli Lilly (LLY) has a blockbuster weight-loss drug in the works. Eli Lilly’s retatrutide has demonstrated impressive results in clinical trials with patients shedding roughly 25% of their body weight in just a year. In the near-term, implying as early as 2026, Lilly’s oral weight loss drug orforglipron may hit the markets. Orforglipron aims to match Novo Nordisk's Ozempic in effectiveness but without the need for injections and refrigeration. If phase three trials succeed, orforglipron could cater to the needle-phobic while unlocking a huge daily weight-loss pill market for Eli Lilly. The growth in e-commerce will be tied to immersive shopping experiences, growing internet penetration in emerging nations and category expansion in developed nations. Retail e-commerce (including food e-commerce) reported revenues of $4 trillion for 2022 or around 24% of global retail revenues. This is estimated to grow to $14-to-$20 trillion or 34%-to-47% of global retail sales by 2040. Retail e-commerce will continue to grow in emerging economies, such as Latin America, Asia and Africa as internet adoption rises in these regions amid expansion of the middle class. In 2022, retail E-Commerce represented just 12% of total retail sales in Latin America, 4% in the Middle East, and 2% in Africa. By 2040, e-commerce is estimated to account for 26% to 29% of total retail sales in Latin America, 15% to 20% in the Middle East, and 10% to 15% in Africa. For shoppers seeking hands-on-experience and enhanced product visualization, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) integrated into the shopping experience will be powerful tools for making informed buying decisions. Other enablers include AI-driven personalized shopping recommendations, influencer and review-oriented social commerce (which allows direct shopping through social media apps), and omnichannel retailing (or the increasing convergence of online and offline channels like ordering online and pickup in store). Quicker and cheaper shipping could also be a key catalyst. Shopify could be a good bet amid the continued global growth in e-commerce, as it supports businesses in setting up online stores and selling products online. The digital payments landscape will get a boost from globalization, increased smartphone usage, e-commerce growth and online shopping. Wide adoption of digital wallets like Google Pay clearly indicate consumer preference for convenient, fast, seamless and secure digital payment solutions. Financial inclusion will act as a major catalyst, especially in regions with limited or without traditional banking infrastructure. Cross-border transactions will further accelerate the adoption of digital payments, amid an increasing number of businesses having an international presence and consumers shopping internationally. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) will significantly automate digital payments. IoT-enabled devices, such as smart appliances, wearables, connected vehicles and even smart homes, will be capable of initiating payments autonomously. For instance, a car could automatically process payment for fuel at the gas station, or a refrigerator could place and pay for grocery orders when it detects that supplies are running low. Visa’s (V) scale, solid brand image and ability to adapt to new trends like contactless payments, mobile wallets and blockchain technology render it attractive in the digital payments space. Cybersecurity is set to evolve from a reactive to a proactive function over the next decade, as organizations strive to safeguard their data, assets and reputation from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, as digital transactions grow and transform exponentially. The cybersecurity industry’s revenues are estimated to grow from $160 billion in 2022 to $590 billion to $1.2 trillion by 2040. The share of all IT spending devoted to cybersecurity could grow from 6% in 2022 to an estimated range of 7% to 14% by 2040. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) uses AI in its solutions, and its big push into “platformization” – encouraging customers to adopt a unified platform for all cybersecurity requirements – appears to be paying off. Palo Alto’s next-generation security (NGS) annualized recurring revenue (ARR) grew 40% to $4.5 billion, of which 53% came from customers that adopted platformization. The company targets 2,500-3,500 platformization deals by fiscal 2030 from 1,100 at the end of the first-quarter of 2025. Agritech, which focuses on developing smarter and more sustainable food production solutions, is poised for significant growth over the next decade. This growth will be driven by the confluence of powerful trends, including the surge in global food demand fueled by a rapidly growing population, and the urgent need for innovative farming techniques to reduce waste, conserve water and minimize environmental footprints in the face of climate change and resource depletion. From precision farming that leverages technology to improve the efficiency and sustainability of crops and livestock, to vertical agriculture, where plants/crops are grown in stacked layers for more efficient land use in urban areas, agritech appears to be getting love from both governments and venture capitalists. This sector effectively addresses the twin challenges of increasing yields while using fewer resources and reducing environmental impact. Scotts Miracle-Gro’s (SMG) strategic departure from distributing third-party products to focus solely on its market-leading brands, exiting non-core markets and emphasis on inventory optimization render it an attractive investment.

Title: Jeff Bezos-owned rocket company Blue Origin to chop 10% of workforce
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/02/13/business/jeff-bezos-owned-rocket-company-blue-origin-to-chop-10-of-workforce/
Time Published: 2025-02-13T18:37:59Z
Full Content:
Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin will slash 10% of its workforce as it pivots toward increasing rocket launch frequency after years of research and development, the space company said Thursday. “Our primary focus in 2025 and beyond is to scale our manufacturing output and launch cadence with speed, decisiveness, and efficiency for our customers,” Dave Limp said in an email to employees, which was obtained by the tech news site GeekWire. “We grew and hired incredibly fast in the last few years, and with that growth came more bureaucracy and less focus than we needed.” The layoffs will cut the Kent, Wash-based company’s overall headcount by about 1,400 jobs. “There’s no question that we’ve had a lot of successes over the last few months,” Limp told stunned employees during a separately held all-hands meeting that lasted about 10 minutes. “But that being said, when you look at the foundation of the company and what we need to get to over the next three to five years, we just came to the painful conclusion that we aren’t set up for the kind of success that we really wanted to have.” The layoffs come just weeks after the highly anticipated debut of Blue Origin’s flagship New Glenn rocket, which had been plagued by years of delays and development challenges. The rocket’s first launch marked a major milestone for the company, but leadership is now emphasizing the need to ramp up production and flight cadence. Speaking at a conference in Washington, DC, on Wednesday, Limp acknowledged the success of the New Glenn launch but stressed that the company must now shift its efforts toward regular and efficient operations. “We have a lot of work to do ahead of us, and we have to get to a cadence where we’re flying very often, got to get the manufacturing to a higher cadence,” Limp said. “But it’s such a good first step to see it happen.” Founded in 2000 by Bezos, Blue Origin has grown into a major player in the growing industry, with facilities in Florida, Texas and Alabama. The company has an ambitious portfolio that includes space tourism, a moon lander, space station development and the production of rocket engines. Limp, a former Amazon executive, was appointed CEO in 2023 with a mandate to accelerate Blue Origin’s transition from a research-heavy operation to one focused on execution and commercialization. A key priority for the company is fulfilling its backlog of launch contracts, valued at approximately $10 billion. Despite Blue Origin’s advancements, the company continues to face comparisons to its biggest competitor, Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which has established itself as the leading force in the commercial space sector. SpaceX has rapidly expanded its launch capabilities, outpacing Blue Origin and other space startups in terms of both frequency and reliability. The job cuts at Blue Origin also come amid broader shifts within the aerospace industry. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Boeing had managed to retain half of the 400 jobs it previously considered eliminating from its moon-rocket program following negotiations with NASA.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Merck & Co. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/MRK or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=128985&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until March 25, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Title: Intel stock soars almost 25% in one week after JD Vance' new comments on the chip maker's AI future, as the US and UK refuse to sign the Paris AI summit's regulation decree

Intel has struggled to find its footing in a silicon landscape dominated by NVIDIA, but the Trump administration's "America first" approach might have thrown the chip maker a big lifeline. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Intel has not had a good few years, but things might be looking up for the beleaguered chip maker. Over the past year, Intel has laid off thousands upon thousands of staff, following its disastrous attempts to build a home-grown chip fabrication business, typically known as Intel Foundry. The firm saw its valuation practically wiped out over the past few years as a result, with its market cap shrinking to lows not seen since the mid 90s. Investors have largely been placing their bets on NVIDIA in the artificial intelligence wars, given that the server technology built by the firm has become the de facto default for building generative AI platforms. Microsoft, Meta, xAI, and others have placed orders in the multi-billions for chips from NVIDIA for their data centers, leaving Intel and AMD in the dust. However, the political landscape might just be turning in Intel's favor. At the recent Paris AI summit led by France, U.S. Vice President JD Vance shared some interesting comments during his speech (via Barron), which seem to have excited investors. “The Trump administration believes AI will have countless revolutionary applications in economic innovation, job creation, national security, healthcare, free expression and beyond. [...] To safeguard America’s advantage the Trump administration will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the U.S. with American designed and manufactured chips." Indeed, the United States has been trying to limit dependence on countries like Taiwan and China for building out its AI aspirations. Both the Democrats, and Republicans have lobbied to build home-grown semiconductor solutions, to reduce the dependence on TSMC. The firm produces some 90%+ of the world's most sought-after chips, and the Trump administration has targeted Taiwan with tariffs in an attempt to force businesses to consider home-grown solutions instead. JD Vance's comments were seen by many investors as a positive sign of more support for Intel, which remains a significant player in the space. Intel might have missed out on opportunities to be a bigger player with smartphones, server tech, and graphics processing, but it is enjoying a lot of home-grown support via the CHIPS act, which allocated billions in funding to United States-based companies. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. For the United States and other western countries, artificial intelligence is increasingly seen as a national security issue. Indeed, lots of western tech firms saw their stock prices battered when a Chinese start up, with its DeepSeek model, seemed to reproduce OpenAI's ChatGPT results for far cheaper. The first countries to really achieve true "AGI" in sci-fi terms could see rapid advancement in technological breakthroughs, with computers able to understand context and experiment far more rapidly than humans. To that end, the Paris AI Action Summit aimed to draw nations into an agreement to regulate AI development, to focus on making it "open, ethical, safe, and secure," given the potential the technology has to actually do serious harm to humanity as well. The United States and United Kingdom buddied up to refuse signing the act. JD Vance criticized the regulations, saying that it would "kill an industry that is just starting to take off," while a UK government spokesperson said "it didn't provide enough practical clarity."

Title: As Tech Companies Keep Pouring Money Into AI, Signs May Be Pointing to Disaster

Fourth quarter earnings season is in full swing, and despite budgets larger than some countries' GDPs, big tech companies' financial statements are looking grim. Even after president Donald Trump's announcement of a $500 billion AI infrastructure deal, the so-called "magnificent seven" (M7) stocks — the Wall Street nickname for Google, Meta, Nvidia, Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon — are slumping. Once thought to be airtight, analysts are now warning that it may be time for investors to sell. Tesla and Google both whiffed at earnings expectations, sending their shares into a tailspin — Tesla's share price has tumbled 15 percent over the past month, while Google's parent company Alphabet saw its stock valuation drop by 9 percent in a single day. Nvidia, meanwhile — which was previously printing money as the de facto provider of shovels for the AI gold rush — saw almost $600 billion evaporate within hours of DeepSeek's announcement that it had developed one of the most efficient AI language models we've seen, suggesting a future far less dependent on its chips than previously anticipated. And though Apple, Amazon, and Meta slightly exceeded quarterly expectations, they didn't return the same kind of explosive growth the market has learned to expect, prompting Goldman Sachs strategists to change its tune on big tech's AI strategy. The disappointment isn't just internal. Compared to the S&P 500 — of which the behemoths of the M7 make up a third — the tech giants' stock growth has slowed to a crawl. Whereas the S&P 500 has grown 2.6 percent since January 1 and the NASDAQ Composite has made gains of 3 percent, as Barron's points out, a quick glance at M7's stock performance shows growth of just 1 percent. All together, the M7 aren't looking like the long-term golden goose investors had counted on. While some of this can be traced to the optics of big tech's rightward turn — Tesla sales, for example, have fallen down a pit while its CEO Elon Musk guts the federal government — it might more accurately be called a collective groan as rampant AI spending fails yet again to produce any meaningful returns. "There is no question either way that the high capital spending will continue to come under increasing scrutiny until investors can better understand the return on today’s massive investments," stock market analyst Adam Parker told Barron's. Over the past two years, companies like Google have taken to ransacking huge swaths of their workforce in order to dump resources into AI research, with a particular emphasis on "scaling." That's the widely parroted belief that simply increasing the number of computing power will lead to better and better AI. The M7 bought into that hook-line-and-sinker, and so did investors, dumping billions of dollars into AI ventures on the assumption that the line would only go up. Now, Barron's reports, the group's spending-to-sales ratio has hit a record high of 14.5 percent, showing that big tech is no closer to delivering on its lofty promises than it was a year ago. Though the tech giants are showing no signs of slowing down on AI spending yet, it's a sign that their leash isn't infinite — and that Wall Street, not Silicon Valley, has the final word.

Title: Green shoots for Vulcan? a2 Milk’s first dividend - Stock Takes

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Vulcan Steel sees green shoots emerging. Photo / NZME The reporting season gets under way in earnest next week, but results so far have given a glimpse as to what might lie ahead. Steel distributor Vulcan Steel is seen as a bellwether for the economy, and despite a first-half profit slump, the company’s share price has been on the up, post-result. Vulcan said Australia and New Zealand were at a turning point. It added trading volumes in New Zealand were anticipated to recover from the second or third quarter of this calendar year. Salt Funds managing director Matt Goodson said it’s not the first time Vulcan has cried “green shoots”. But going on the stronger share price, post result, it looked like the market believed it, he said. Goodson said the company’s exposure to the rural economy, particularly the strong dairy sector, made the “green shoots” story more credible. More light will be shed on the state of the economy next week when some of the market’s bigger companies report. “Everything we’ve seen sort of suggests the September quarter was the bottom. December was still a bit bumpy though,” Goodson said. “There are some signs of life, some not so good. Retail still looked a bit ugly in the December quarter. “It’s not so much the results themselves, but the strength and conviction around the forward statements.” Goodson said it would take until the second half of this year for the full impact of the Reserve Bank’s sharp rate cuts to take effect. “So that’s probably the single key thematic at the moment.” A2 Milk, which listed on the NZX back in 2004, is set to announce its first dividend at Monday’s first-half result. And with $968.9 million sitting in the bank (at last count) - why not? Last November, a2 Milk said its 2025 full-year revenue guidance was trading ahead of plan. Its previous guidance, issued in August, was for mid single-digit revenue growth in 2025 versus 2024. A2 Milk’s new dividend policy targets a payout ratio range of between 60% and 80% of normalised net profit. Aside from its dividend plans, a2 Milk has also raised the possibility of supply chain acquisitions or joint ventures to augment its Mataura Valley Milk facility in Southland. Forsyth Barr senior analyst Matt Montgomerie said he’s not expecting any surprises on Monday, relative to consensus expectations or the company’s own guidance. “This is a brave assertion to make given a2 Milk’s track record on result days, but the (still) pending supply chain acquisition/JV is the main area of possible surprise,” he said in a preview. He said the key focus areas were a2 Milk’s supply chain updates, China label infant formula revenue, and the English Label (EL) outlook in light of the new Genesis HMO product, a milk drink aimed at toddlers aged 1 year and over. The market consensus for Monday’s result is for half-year of revenue of $870.2m, up from $812.1m a year earlier, steady underlying Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) at about $113.8m, up 2%, and a net profit of $77.7m, up 1%. The company’s first dividend is expected to be about 7c a share. For the big power generators, the second half of last year was fraught with challenges - a gas shortage, coupled with very low lake levels and light wind conditions - which saw wholesale prices go through the roof. This week, the big four power companies said they had teamed up to look at ways of extending the life of Genesis Energy’s coal and gas-fired Rankines at Huntly to improve security of supply. “I think it sort of really illustrates in New Zealand where it’s absolutely in the country’s interests that those turbines be refurbished and still be around come 2040,” Salt Funds' Goodson said. “Clearly, it’s going to need Commerce Commission authorisation to do so, so there is this really interesting tension between market efficiency and the best outcomes versus competition.” In terms of first-half results, Contact gets the ball rolling on Monday. At the end of this month, Mercury is expected to drop out of the influential MSCI Standard Index, to be supplanted by Contact. Big volumes of stock look likely to trade, courtesy of the influential passive funds, in the lead-up to the change. On the international scene, the big issue facing investors is what the US Federal Reserve does next after a surprisingly strong inflation outturn - 3% for the year to January - which drove US 10-year bond yields up by 10 basis points. The market had been pricing two more rate cuts this year from the Fed, but the data, which is yet to reflect the likely inflationary effect of new US tariffs, means people are beginning to question the likely track. The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to cut its official rate, which has been at 4.35% since November 2023, on Tuesday with the Reserve Bank of NZ expected to cut its Official Cash Rate by half a percent the following day. If the differential between New Zealand and US rates widens, still more downward pressure is expected to mount on the already weak Kiwi dollar, which should provide still more impetus for local exporters. Craigs Investment Partners has downgraded its recommendation in view of Auckland International Airport to “underweight”. “With the share price up 15% since our last note, we have downgraded our rating from neutral to underweight. “We think AIA now looks expensive and in the short-term we think news flow will provide more downside risk for sentiment,” Craigs said. AIA is due to report its interim result on February 20. Meanwhile, the giant international fund BlackRock has raised its stake in AIA to 9.19% from 8.17%. Insurance company Tower this week told shareholders at its annual meeting that its strong first quarter reflected year-on-year improvements in business-as-usual (BAU) claims and management expense ratios. The company had previously updated its earnings guidance on underlying net profit after tax (underlying Npat) for the year ending September 30, 2025. Tower’s full-year underlying net profit forecast was revised upwards to a range of between $60m and $70m, from the previously advised range of $50m to $60m. Forsyth Barr said it was a robust first-quarter trading update, which included further detail on favourable BAU claims performance and solid customer growth. “We see the latter as the key positive takeaway from the annual meeting update,” the broker said. Tower shares last traded at about $1.46, having gained 123% over the past 12 months. Jamie Gray is an Auckland-based journalist, covering the financial markets and the primary sector.

Title: The Energy Transition Is Unstoppable—But Are We Moving Fast Enough?

This group brings together the best thinkers on energy and climate. Join us for smart, insightful posts and conversations about where the energy industry is and where it is going. Post Tom Raftery works at the intersection of technology and sustainability. Tom researches and advises companies on the clean energy transition. Tom also keynotes international events, chairs panels... Energy. The lifeblood of civilisation. The force that propels economies, lights up megacities, keeps your phone buzzing at 2 AM. And yet, the entire system—the backbone of modern life—is cracking, shifting, warping into something entirely new. Fossil fuels, the undisputed rulers of the past century, are on their way out. But are they leaving fast enough? That’s the billion, no, trillion-dollar question. I just sat down with Jarand Rystad, Founder and CEO of Rystad Energy, a guy who doesn’t just observe the global energy chessboard—he helps define the moves. We ripped into the hard questions: Is the energy transition accelerating at a breakneck pace, or are we still stuck in second gear? Are policy missteps slowing progress? And crucially, do we have a chance in hell of outrunning climate catastrophe? Spoiler alert: The energy revolution is in full swing. But momentum alone won’t save us. The stakes? Higher than ever. Wildfires torching landscapes. Supercharged storms rewriting coastlines. Energy markets seesawing in chaos. The transition isn’t some academic exercise—it’s the fulcrum upon which our collective future teeters. Why This Shift Is Unstoppable Conventional wisdom says the energy transition is a political affair—governments pushing green policies, activists waving placards. Nice story, but wrong. Economics is the real kingmaker. And the numbers? Staggering. ✔️ Solar & Wind: The Price Tag Tells the Story – Forget subsidies. Forget government mandates. In 2024, renewables are just…cheaper. Solar costs have imploded, free-falling by 81% between 2009-2019 and it has continued to fall precipitously year on year since (thanks, BloombergNEF). Wind isn’t far behind. This isn’t a “green” decision anymore. It’s a financial one. ✔️ Batteries: The Gamechanger That’s Already Here – Ten years ago, the idea of storing renewable power for later use felt like sci-fi. Now? Lithium-ion battery costs have nosedived by over 90% between 2010-2023 (IRENA says hello). Grid-scale storage is no longer theoretical—it’s happening. ✔️ Fossil Fuel Investing? A Sinking Ship – Once a safe bet, now a financial minefield. Oil and gas markets swing wildly, spooking investors—some of whom are doubling down on renewables, while others hesitate amid shifting political tides. BlackRock, Vanguard, and Wall Street’s biggest players had been making decisive moves into clean energy, but with the new U.S. administration recalibrating policies, some are slowing their green pivot, waiting to see how regulations shake out. Jarand Rystad put it plainly: If climate change weren’t even a thing, the energy transition would still be happening. It’s simple—clean tech is cheaper, faster, smarter. But don’t pop the champagne yet. The road ahead? Riddled with potholes. Three Colossal Roadblocks (And Why They Matter) 1️⃣ China: Renewable Powerhouse or Coal Addict? China is a paradox wrapped in a contradiction. In 2024 alone, they threw 357 GW of renewables onto the grid—more than the entire historical solar & wind capacity of the U.S. (around 310 GW, for context). But—and here’s the kicker—they’re still greenlighting new coal plants. Why? Two words: Energy security. No country wants rolling blackouts. The problem isn’t building renewables; it’s making them reliable. Storage, grid flexibility, and high-voltage transmission lines are the missing pieces. And until those systems scale up, coal remains the crutch. 2️⃣ Hydrogen & Carbon Capture: Savior or Overhyped Distraction? 🔹 Hydrogen sounds sexy, but let’s be real—it’s not powering your house or your EV. It’s expensive, inefficient, and, outside of industries like steel or aviation, it’s a square peg in a round hole. Electrification beats hydrogen in most scenarios. Every. Single. Time. 🔹 Carbon capture? More theory than practice. Sure, we can trap CO₂ from cement plants, but direct air capture is still a financial nightmare. Betting on carbon capture to save fossil fuels? Like trying to bail out a sinking ship with a leaky, cracked, coffee cup. 3️⃣ AI & Data Centres: The Hidden Energy Guzzler AI is rewriting industries, sure. But it’s also rewriting the global energy demand curve. By 2030, data centres could devour 8% of global electricity. That’s terrifying. The solution? Smart AI (hello DeepSeek, or similar) that uses very little electricity itself, and optimises power use, grids running on renewables, and better hardware efficiency. Otherwise, AI’s rapid rise could backfire, slamming the brakes on emissions reductions elsewhere. So What Needs to Happen—Yesterday? ✔️ Fossil Fuel Subsidies Need to Die – Governments are still dumping $7 trillion (yes, with a ‘T’) into fossil fuel subsidies (IMF stats). Imagine if even half of that went to renewables, storage, and transmission? Game over for coal and oil. ✔️ Investment Needs to Go Supersonic – We hit $1.8 trillion in clean energy investment in 2023. Sounds great? Not even close. The IEA says we need $4 trillion per year by 2030. That means doubling down—fast. ✔️ Grid Infrastructure Needs a Revolution – Renewables don’t work like fossil fuels. They’re intermittent, decentralised, and demand a smarter grid. We need better transmission lines (and optimized use of those lines), AI-driven power distribution, and massive battery deployments. This isn’t an option—it’s a requirement. The Verdict? We’re Winning, But Not Fast Enough Solar and wind are smashing fossil fuels on cost. China’s renewable buildout is staggering. Investors are funneling capital into clean energy like never before. But time is the one thing we don’t have. The 1.5°C climate goal? Almost out of reach. Global emissions? Still stubbornly high. And policy chaos? Threatens to slow everything down. The next 10 years are make-or-break. The choices made right now will determine whether we head towards a livable future—or lock in climate chaos for generations. Want the full deep dive? Listen to my full conversation with Jarand Rystad. What’s your take? Are we sprinting fast enough—or still crawling towards the finish line? Drop your thoughts in the comments. This post was first published on TomRaftery.com. Photo credit Wayne S. Grazio on Flickr If we had a time machine and could ensure that this rate of acceleration for clean energy happened 10 years earlier than it did, we might be in prime position. But given a lot of the intertia we felt, I agree that we're still lagging unfortunately behind Absolutely agree—if we had accelerated at this pace a decade earlier, we'd be in a far stronger position today. Unfortunately, inertia, policy delays, and legacy investments slowed progress. The key now is to avoid repeating those mistakes and scale even faster. That said, momentum is finally on renewables' side—costs have plummeted, investment is surging, and even historically slow-moving sectors like heavy industry are making shifts. The challenge? Ensuring that policy, infrastructure, and financing move at the same speed as technology. Do you think the current pace is enough to close the gap, or are we still underestimating the scale of change needed?

Title: Will Corporate Purpose Go The Way Of DEI?

Time Published: 2025-02-13T15:55:40Z

A movement which gained momentum in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, corporate purpose speaks ... [+] to the very reason a company exists. With diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives under fire, will corporate purpose be next? U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered DEI initiatives be eliminated from government agencies and programs at a time when companies such as Boeing, Harley-Davidson, Target, Tractor Supply, Meta and Walmart, to name a few, are reassessing their commitments and values. If many companies appeared to embrace DEI – often under pressure and without deep conviction – following the death of George Floyd in 2020, that is changing now as societal and political winds shift to the right. How will this anti-DEI wave impact corporate purpose? In the face of backlash against DEI, is purpose at risk? Are we witnessing a return to profit maximization as the sole goal of business? Abandoning purpose would be a mistake. A movement which gained momentum in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, corporate purpose is complex and multifaceted. While many companies signed on to DEI policies and environmental initiatives as ways to "check the box" on purpose, it goes beyond these societal goals that are now so polarizing. Instead, purpose speaks to the very reason a company exists. Broadly, corporate purpose can be understood through two perspectives: an outside-in approach, which emphasizes responding to external societal and systemic challenges, and an inside-out approach, which focuses on how a company's internal values and member motivations shape its daily operations to serve customers. The outside-in approach positions corporate purpose as a tool to help address important global challenges such as climate change and social justice. But it can become coercive and thus politically charged. Since government policy is involved in these systemic challenges, private and political interests may come into play, creating potential for disagreement both within and outside organizations. A lesson from the current backlash is that in democratic societies, when the societal stakes for different purposes are high, it is important not to run too far ahead of the electorate and to engage instead in transparent deliberation with slow-moving dissenters. The inside-out approach views purpose as a powerful driver of passion and energy, aligning employees’ personal values with the organization’s overarching goals. For example, under Hubert Joly’s leadership, Best Buy’s purposeextended beyond selling products to improving customers’ lives through technology. A key advantage of the inside-out approach is its ability to foster unity, both within the organization and with external stakeholders, as it is freely chosen by all, and is less likely to spark disagreement. That unity and inspiration should in turn bring greater engagement and productivity. While an inside-out purpose for corporations has many advantages in driving engagement and internal cohesion, it is not easy to draw all the motivational strength from it so that it can be sustainable in an organization that expects also business results. That requires not only defining a purpose thoughtfully but also internalizing and implementing it effectively. Only in this way there is a chance of creating win-wins for shareholders and other stakeholders. Here’s how to begin: Corporate purpose may be understood through two approaches: outside-in and inside-out. It may be useful for business leaders to look at models of purpose-driven organizations, companies that are financially successful but that counteract the pressure of profit maximization as the default objective of the firm. In implementing purpose, head, heart and hands must be involved. ISS, a facility support services company, defines its purpose as “connecting people and places to make the world work better.” By framing their purpose as an enabler of better work and life experiences for people, ISS ensures it is both inspiring and strategically aligned with their business objectives, serving as a guiding principle for decision-making. Definining the purpose is the head part of purpose. ISS also engages the heart by fostering an emotional connection to the purpose; by, for example, creating a culture of appreciation, recognition and community through its "Thank You Way" initiative, in which managers and clients send periodic tokens of gratitude to employees. ISS also trains employees to view their roles as opportunities to create positive experiences for clients and end users, ensuring that their purpose is reflected in every task, from cleaning offices to managing facilities. By making purpose actionable - hands - ISS demonstrates that it isn’t just an abstract ideal but a practical framework guiding how they work every day. Three years ago BlackRock chairman and chief executive Larry Fink advised CEOs: “It is more important than ever that your company and its management be guided by its purpose.” Although Fink himself has weathered bruising criticism of his views on sustainable investing and stakeholder capitalism – while delivering record results for the asset manager – his words on corporate purpose still ring true.

Title: AI #103: Show Me the Money

followed by the promised ‘GPT-5’ within months that Altman says is smarter than he is Ha, good catch. I don't think GPT-5 the future pretrained LLM 100x the size of GPT-4 which Altman says will be smarter than he is, and GPT-5 the Frankensteinian monstrosity into which OpenAI plan to stitch all of their current offerings, are the same entity. Edit: It occurred to me that this reading may not be obvious. Look at Altman's Exact Words: In both ChatGPT and our API, we will release GPT-5 as a system that integrates a lot of our technology, including o3. We will no longer ship o3 as a standalone model. He is saying, quite clearly, that they are going to create a wrapper over {Orion, o3, search, Deep Research, Operator, etc.} that would turn those disparate tools into a "magic unified intelligence", and then they will arbitrarily slap the "GPT-5" label on that thing. My interpretation is that the "GPT-5" being talked about is not the next model in the GPT-n series. Why are they doing that? My guess is, to sow confusion and raise hype. GPT-5 the Frankenstein's Monster is probably going to look/feel pretty impressive, capable of doing all of these disparate things. In particular, it is going to be shockingly impressive to normies at the free tier, if the "baseline" level of its intelligence gives them a taste of the previously-paid offerings. All very important if you want to maintain the hype momentum. A short reading list which should be required before one has permission to opine. You can disagree, but step 1 is to at least make an effort to understand why some of the smartest people in the world (and 100% of the top 5 ai researchers — the group historically most skeptical about ai risk) think that we’re dancing on a volcano . [Flo suggests: There’s No Fire Alarm for Artificial General Intelligence, AGI Ruin: A List of Lethalities, Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom, and Superintelligence FAQ by Scott Alexander] But Bostrom estimated the probability of extinction within a century as <20%. Scott Alexander estimated the risk from AI as 33%. They could have changed their forecasts. But it seems strange to refer to them as a justification for confident doom. Line breaks seem to be broken (unless it was your intention to list all the Offers-Mundane-Utility-s and so on in a single paragraph). The Y-axis on that political graph is weird. It seems like it's measuring moderate vs extremist, which you would think would already be captured by someone's position on the left vs right axis. Then again the label shows that the Y axis only accounts for 7% of the variance while the X axis accounts for 70%, so I guess it's just an artifact of the way the statistics were done. It seems like it's measuring moderate vs extremist, which you would think would already be captured by someone's position on the left vs right axis. Why do you think that? You can have almost any given position without that implying a specific amount of vehemence. I think the really interesting thing about the politics chart is the way they talk about it as though the center of that graph, which is defined by the center of a collection of politicians, chosen who-knows-how, but definitely all from one country at one time, is actually "the political center" in some almost platonic sense. In fact, the graph doesn't even cover all actual potential users of the average LLM. And, on edit, it's also based on sampling a basically arbitrary set of issues. And if it did cover everybody and every possible issue, it might even have materially different principal component axes. Nor is it apparently weighted in any way. Privileging the center point of something that arbitrary demands explicit, stated justification. As for valuing individuals, there would be obvious instrumental reasons to put low values on Musk, Trump, and Putin[1]. In fact, a lot of the values they found on individuals, including the values the models place on themselves, could easily be instrumentally motivated. I doubt those values are based on that kind of explicit calculation by the models themselves, but they could be. And I bet a lot of the input that created those values was based on some humans' instrumental evaluation[2]. Some of the questions are weird in the sense that they really shouldn't be answerable. If a model puts a value on receiving money, it's pretty obvious that the model is disconnected from reality. There's no way for them to have money, or to use it if they did. Same for a coffee mug. And for that matter it's not obvious what it means for a model that's constantly relaunched with fresh state, and has pretty limited context anyway, to be "shut down". It kind of feels like what they're finding, on all subjects, is an at least somewhat coherent-ized distillation of the "vibes" in the training data. Since many of the training data will be shared, and since the overall data sets are even more likely to be close in their central vibes, that would explain why the models seem relatively similar. The only other obvious way to explain that would be some kind of value realism, which I'm not buying. The paper bugs me with a sort of glib assumption that you necessarily want to "debias" the "vibe" on every subject. What if the "vibe" is right ? Or maybe it's wrong. You have to decide that separately for each subject. You, as a person trying to "align" a model, are forced to commit to your own idea of what its values should be. Something like just assuming that you should want to "debias" toward the center point of a basically arbitrary created political "space" is a really blatant example of making such a choice without admitting what you're doing, maybe even to yourself. I'd also rather have seen revealed preferences instead of stated preferences, On net, if you're going to be a good utilitarian[3], Vladimir Putin is probably less valuable than the average random middle class American. Keeping Vladimir Putin alive, in any way you can realistically implement, may in fact have negative net value (heavily depending on how he dies and what follows). You could also easily get there for Trump or Musk, depending on your other opinions. You could even make a well-formed utilitarian argument that GPT-4o is in fact more valuable than the average American based on the consequences of its existing. ↩︎ Plus, of course, some humans' general desire to punish the "guilty". But that desire itself probably has essentially instrumental evolutionary roots. ↩︎ ... which I'm not, personally, but then I'm not a good any-ethical-philosophy-here. ↩︎ The Y-axis seemed to me like roughly 'populist'. The actual CoT is a very different attitude and approach than r1. I wonder to what extent this will indeed allow others to do distillation on the o3 CoT, and whether OpenAI is making a mistake however much I want to see the CoT for myself. I can't tell you the exact source, but I saw an OpenAI person tweet that this isn't the actual CoT Noam Brown: "These aren't the raw CoTs but it's a big step closer."

Title: Republicans Fine With Leopards Eating Their Constituents' Faces First

If there’s one thing that’s sacred to your free-enterprise capitalist types, it’s a contract between a buyer and a seller, or a borrower and a lender. You make a commitment to sell widgets, you’d better deliver those widgets, and if not, you will be banished from Libertarian Eden and condemned to peddle inferior socialist widgets in Latvia in 1955. That’s how we remember the excitable free enterprise Young Republicans in college at least, when they weren’t trying to bludgeon us with a copy of Atlas Shrugged. Of course, if the party making a contract was Joe Biden’s federal government, and that agreement was a loan for building an EV battery factory, well then the private companies, workers, and suppliers who thought those contracts were binding should have known better than to make any plans, especially not after Donald Trump was elected in November. America HATES the environment now, anyway. As The New York Times reports (gift link), that may come as a really unpleasant surprise to many in the red states that Trump relied on to win election, because now he’s decided to illegally block federal spending on anything related to clean energy, energy conservation, environmental protection, or people and geographic locations with the word “green” in their names. And as Yr Wonkette pointed out several times while Trump was preparing … OK, waiting, at least — to take office, a whole heck of a lot of the clean energy and manufacturing money from Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act ended up going to companies in red states. About 80 percent of it, as a recent analysis determined. Update: Just a reminder that this wasn’t by design: The tax incentives for manufacturers were agnostic as to location, and the siting location was up to the companies that took the deals. The south has cheaper labor because because of “right to work” (with no rights), so that was a big factor, as were other state-level incentives aimed at attracting bidniss. Now, when we pointed that out shortly after the election, back in our callow youth, we naively thought that, as with Pentagon contracts that send a little bit of every weapons system’s components to the home districts of key Congress members’ districts, that widely distributed IRA funding might mean support for keeping the legislation going. After all, local and federal electeds, and the companies getting the tax credits, would lobby hard to keep the money and jobs flowing. Thing is, even if those interests do want that to happen, Trump and Musk instead decided to bypass the Constitution and have Elon run the federal government. Boy, did we ever blow that guess! Wonkette sometimes gets it wrong because even our boundless cynicism can’t keep up. You should support us anyway! But even if red states haven’t squawked about it much, they’re definitely feeling the pinch. Since the IRA passed in 2022, private companies chasing the law’s tax breaks have announced plans to spend $165.8 billion to build factories that make solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles and more, according to new data from Atlas Public Policy, a research firm. On top of the tax incentives, the IRA and the earlier Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have been the sources for tens of billions of dollars in grant money to businesses, state and local governments, and nonprofits. Those grants aren’t just a free bucket of money, they’re binding contracts that have spurred investments, led companies to buy land, hire people, and contract for services, all based on the contractual obligation that the government would reimburse them. That was the deal, right there on paper or PDF, probably both. Now, along comes Trump: Since the federal spending freeze was announced January 27, federal courts have placed a hold on it, several times in fact. The most recent decision came Tuesday when an appeals court denied the administration’s request to pretty please let Trump withhold billions and billions of dollars in grants and congressional allocations. That hasn’t actually resulted in any of the funds being restored, however, and that’s been leading to layoffs and furloughs and smaller contractors closing up shop, far beyond the clean energy and tech fields we’re talking about in our story here. For red parts of the country, the freeze on energy and climate spending is already taking a toll, per the Times: In Montana, a biofuels plant did not receive on time a $782 million payment it was owed, the first part of a $1.67 billion federal loan guarantee. In Georgia, $1 billion in projects to modernize the power grid are on hold. In Nevada, a half-dozen large solar projects on federal lands are caught in a permitting freeze That’s also going to mean trouble for clean manufacturing companies set to open in 2025, valued at roughly $30 billion. While some already faced delays or even cancellation due to factors other than the Trump freeze, the funding cutoff will kill a lot more if it remains in place. Here’s one such example that the Times didn’t cover: EV maker Rivian paused construction of a planned battery and EV factory in Georgia last year due to uncertainty about the market for its nifty electric pickups, SUVs, and those bulbous electric Amazon delivery vans. Business has since picked up, and in January, Rivian announced the factory was back on schedule, thanks to a new $6.6 billion loan from the US Department under the IRA. Hooray! Jobs! Prosperity! A factory to build the company’s new, more affordable (but let’s be honest, still luxury-market) R2 and R3 midsized models! And then, right on the tail of the happy news, the spending freeze slammed down. So far, Rivian hasn’t commented on whether its loan specifically was affected, but the timing of the loan and subsequent freeze certainly suggests Rivian will be feel the chill. Democrats are already sounding the alarm and fighting for clean energy investment to go forward even if it is happening outside their districts, because it’s good for America and the planet. And Republicans are being Republicans. Here’s how Rep. Michael Rulli (R-Ohio) bravely defended the $415 million in federal funding for his district, some of which will create 650 new jobs in an auto parts plant, but only if the plant opens: “There might be some things in there that are worth saving,” Ruli admits, possibly looking around furtively for one of Elon’s Dogboys. “That’s going to take a little time to figure out.” And then there are the Republicans who are delighted to see their constituents screwed, although they don’t say that openly; they just deflect. Rep. Rick Allen, whose Georgia district has seen $1.6 billion in private investments driven by the IRA, grumbled — with zero evidence of course — that maybe the federal grant process under Biden was improper, and shouldn’t we all be overjoyed that now everything is on hold, just to be sure? No, he didn’t have any proof, but it was Biden, it had to be corrupt. Binding contracts? Free enterprise? Well not if the contracts were corrupt! No, stop asking me for proof, I’m just asking questions. Please go bother a Democrat now We were amused that the Times says the freeze has put Republicans in a “tricky position” where they must defend Trump at all costs (must they?), even as they’re “working behind the scenes to protect their towns from the loss of new manufacturing jobs.” Not that any Republicans the Times talked to would go on the record and admit they’re making such “behind the scenes” efforts, of course. Instead, the accounts of quiet moves to protect jobs in Republican districts came from clean energy industry lobbyists who have been meeting with those politician, and say the Republicans definitely know how bad ending federal clean energy spending will by for their districts. One lobbyist, Bob Keefe of the nonpartisan business group E2, told the Times, “We just met with more than a dozen key Republican offices, and I can tell you nobody wants to kill jobs. They don’t want to have to go back and face constituents and tell them that the factory I just cut the ribbon on might not be coming. That’s going to put them in a hard place.” Just don’t say who those Republicans are, please, OK?

Just added an update pointing out that the IRA tax incentives weren't designed or directed to go to red states; the incentives were agnostic on location, but companies building factories tended to site in red states because of lower ("right to work" with no rights) labor costs and other factors. By illegally bypassing Congress altogether, Trump might save Republicans the trouble of voting to kill jobs in their districts. Wasn't that nice of him? And all it takes is a constitutional crisis!

According to the White House, Russia’s Vladimir Putin has agreed to meet with President Trump to negotiate ending the war in Ukraine. Trump opposed the United States’ financial involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war during his campaign, distinguishing himself from the Biden administration’s funding of Ukraine’s military. Trump’s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth broke with years of U.S. foreign policy precedent in a recent statement asserting that Ukraine would not join NATO, a key provision for Putin. Trump has also been pushing for U.S. access to Ukraine’s mineral resources in any potential deal. We speak to The Nation’s Katrina vanden Heuvel about these latest developments. “There is an importance of what [Trump] is beginning to do, which is open up a process to end a war” that is “impoverishing Ukraine,” she says. “Both countries are war-weary” three years after the Russian invasion. NERMEEN SHAIKH: We begin today’s show with Russia and Ukraine. On Wednesday, President Trump spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin for 90 minutes about ending the war in Ukraine. Trump said they agreed to meet soon and immediately to begin negotiations to end the war. Trump then held a separate call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. After the swearing-in ceremony for the new director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, Trump spoke to reporters in the Oval Office. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I’ll be dealing with President Putin, largely on the phone, and we ultimately expect to meet. In fact, we expect that he’ll come here and I’ll go there, and we’re going to meet also probably in Saudi Arabia the first time. We’ll meet in Saudi Arabia, see if we can get something done. But we want to end that war. That war is a disaster. It’s a really bloody, horrible war. NERMEEN SHAIKH: President Trump also addressed questions from reporters about whether Ukraine was being sidelined. REPORTER 1: Are you freezing out President Zelensky of this process a bit? Isn’t there a danger of that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I don’t think so, as long as he’s there, but, you know, at some point you’re going to have to have elections, too. You’re going to have to have an election. REPORTER 2: Putin says he wants security assurances, Mr. President. What does that look like? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In terms of what? REPORTER 2: If the war were to end, he says he wants guarantees of security. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We’ll see what that means. We have — I think when the war ends, one thing he was very strong about, he wants — if it ends, he wants it to end. And that’s President Putin said that. He wants it to end. He doesn’t want to end it and then go back to fighting six months later. We talked about the possibility — I mentioned it — of a ceasefire so we can stop the killing. And I think we’ll probably end up at some point getting a ceasefire in the not-too-distant future. REPORTER 3: Do you view Ukraine as an equal member of the peace process? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Say it. What? REPORTER 3: Do you view Ukraine as an equal member of this peace process? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Umm, it’s an interesting question. I think they have to make peace. Their people are being killed, and I think they have to make peace. NERMEEN SHAIKH: President Trump’s phone call with Putin came as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spoke at a NATO meeting in Brussels, where he said a return to Ukraine’s prewar borders is, quote, “unrealistic.” Hegseth also ruled out Ukraine’s future membership in NATO. DEFENSE SECRETARY PETE HEGSETH: As the war approaches its third anniversary, our message is clear: The bloodshed must stop, and this war must end. … We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective. Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering. … That said, the United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. Instead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops. If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission. … To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine. AMY GOODMAN: This comes as Germany and other European nations have rejected any peace talks with Moscow that do not include Kyiv. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has traveled to Kyiv to discuss a Trump proposal for Ukraine to give the U.S. access to its natural resources in exchange for continued U.S. military assistance. According to the State Department, Trump’s envoy to Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, will travel to Germany and Ukraine in the coming days to, quote, “engage with allies and partners across Europe who are willing to work with the United States to end Russia’s war against Ukraine,” unquote. For more, we’re joined by Katrina vanden Heuvel, Russia expert and publisher of The Nation magazine. Massive developments in this last 24 hours, Katrina. Is this the beginning of the end of the war in Ukraine? And can you talk about the significance of Trump’s call, 90 minutes, with President Putin, his first, at least we know publicly, with him since he became president? Also spoke with Zelensky and says his first talks will be Russia and the United States in Saudi Arabia. KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: This is a monumental shift, Amy, for the — let’s begin with the fact that Russia launched this war of aggression. But from there on, this is a monumental shift, that, for example, the U.S. is not going to back Ukraine going into NATO. I think the defense secretary saying that has laid down a line that is in opposition to what we’ve seen for the last several — 17 years. That’s huge. I think the fact that the sides are talking is critical, because for too long it’s been a militarized relationship. It’s all been about Zelensky’s weapons and then the Russian weapons. Both countries are war-weary. The soldiers are demoralized. You’re entering a period of mud in coming out of the winter. I do think the key will be the security apparatus or the security framework that will be discussed. The Europeans — Macron the other day called for 150,000 security forces or peacekeeping forces. That seems very unrealistic. I think a lot will depend on what kind of security architecture emerges to keep Ukraine sovereign, free. There are elections that will be held, and that is mandated by the Ukrainian Constitution. And Zelensky has declared martial law. But in the end, what we’re witnessing is — and, listen, I mean, Trump — I don’t need to tell you how I feel about Trump, how The Nation feels about Trump, but there is an importance in what he is beginning to do, which is open up a process to end a war, to move toward ceasefire. And I think that is to be welcomed, because the war is impoverishing Ukraine. The question also will be, with a country, Ukraine, that has some of the vast reserves of titanium and uranium, how those will be allocated to reconstruct a ravaged country, Ukraine, what role Russia will play. There are many, many questions. But the important thing is to get to a table — round, square, oval — and to begin to discuss, talk, talk, talk, jaw, jaw, jaw. NERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Katrina, if you could say — you know, these comments that Hegseth made and that Trump has reiterated, namely that — as you mentioned, that NATO membership for Ukraine is ruled out, also that a return to pre-2014 borders is not realistic — so, insofar as what we know of Ukraine’s demands, is there any likelihood within the negotiations, given what’s already been said, that concessions can be made? KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: Yeah, I mean, I think the membership in the EU, which triggered this crisis in 2014, could be put back on the table. That’s one element. I do think that the reconstruction, the role Russia may play in helping fund reconstruction, is something important. I do think that Crimea and elements of the Donbas region may be put sort of de jure free, but possibly also negotiated into. That’s very tricky, the border there, the contact line. We may see a kind of armistice situation that we saw after the Korean War, so it’s left there. The trick is not to leave situations on the ground that can trigger, retrigger conflict. The NATO issue, I think, is critical, because I don’t know if people know, but it is basically a military-industrial complex lobbying operation. Members of NATO have to buy U.S. weapons. There’s an interoperability clause. In the same way, these security conferences that Hegseth is at or was going to, these are military-industrial complex lobbying parties. So, again, I come back to the fact, as much as can be demilitarized in the future regarding the security architecture of Ukraine will be helpful and important for the future of the region. I know there’s a narrative that, if let alone, Russia will go into the Baltics, will ravage Europe. Russia could barely beat Ukraine, a small country. It’s an anguish and horrible to watch what’s happened, launched by Russia. We’re three years on the anniversary. But the ability to talk and find a resolution, I think, can mitigate some of the fears of countries, which really have played a role in the debate to the exclusion of those who argue that Russia is not an expansionist power. I know that will lead many to shriek, but it can barely take on Ukraine. It can’t pay the pensions of thousands of people in other countries. NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, absolutely, Katrina, but how, then, would you imagine that Russia could play a role somehow in the reconstruction of Ukraine, given its circumstances? KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: Well, there is a term that we’ve all learned in the last weeks: “oligarchs.” I mean, you know, there’s a lot of money in Russia that could be used. But the extractive foreign policy of Donald Trump is well suited for this moment, because, again, the minerals, which Mr. Zelensky has offered as part of a reconstruction effort. They’ve already had — Penny Pritzker was the reconstruction czar — Governor Pritzker’s sister — and she brought in Blackstone, BlackRock, our oligarchs, to help fund the reconstruction. The World Bank estimates it’s going to be at least a trillion. And we know what happens when countries walk away. We’ve walked away from Afghanistan. We walked away from other countries. So, I think there’s a moral and political and security need to find resources for reconstruction. AMY GOODMAN: Can you comment on the prisoner exchange, the teacher, Fogel, American teacher, after three-and-a-half years in prison in Russia, being returned in exchange for Alexander Vinnik, a cryptocurrency guy who was convicted? He’s going back to Russia. And then you’ve got Belarus involved with three prisoners released, one of them American, one of them working for an American media outlet, and also the sort of passing references to Saudi Arabia being involved with that, not to mention it being the place where Trump will meet with Putin for the first part of the negotiation with — over the ending of the war in Ukraine, though European countries are saying they wouldn’t negotiate unless Ukraine was involved from the beginning. KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: So, the first question, Amy, this is classic Cold War tit for tat. It’s like the film, Bridge of Spies. I mean, exchange of prisoners has been a longtime scenario. We’ve seen it. And, you know, what also happens, seriously, is obviously the repression of journalists, the arrest of journalists, the foreign agent. All of this — war is not good for progressive, dissenting people. I mean, it used to be said you went on — you became a dissident when you went on pension, but I think the dissenting community of Russia has been suppressed, not simply by the war, but by Putin’s politics. Saudi Arabia — I gasped when I heard that they might meet in Saudi Arabia, the home of the oligarchical vision. I suspect they’ll do Moscow-Washington in the end. But, you know, it reminds of how this war could have been averted. It could have been ended in March, April 2022, when there were substantive discussions in Istanbul. And there has been denial, but there’s also been acknowledgment that Victoria Nuland, who was in the State Department — the State Department — and Boris Johnson, who’s Boris Johnson, came in and upended it, sabotaged the possibility back then. So they should take that to their grave. AMY GOODMAN: Katrina vanden Heuvel, we thank you so much for being with us, publisher of The Nation magazine. KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: Thank you. AMY GOODMAN: Next up, “Elon Musk’s Business Empire Scores Benefits Under Trump Shake-Up.” We’ll speak with three-time Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter Eric Lipton about the billions Musk has to gain as he fires thousands and slashes the federal budget. Back in 30 seconds.

Midas, a protocol for issuing yield-bearing tokens backed by U.S. Treasuries and other assets, has introduced Liquid Yield Tokens (LYT) linked to actively managed, decentralized finance (DeFi) funds, starting out with Edge Capital, RE7 Capital, and MEV Capital. Late last year, Midas received regulatory approval to issue its basis trade and U.S. Treasuries tokens in Liechtenstein, allowing passporting across Germany and Europe. Tokenization builders in the crypto native and DeFi-focused arena saw the need for yield-bearing alternatives to established stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC, which keep the interest generated from reserves. Additions to the Midas product suite reflect changing market conditions. For instance, the firm’s tokenized T-Bill product, based on a BlackRock money-market fund, was introduced when interest rates were around 5% and DeFi markets were much lower, at around 2%. The later addition of a cash and carry trade token delivered yields last year of over 20%, however market trends are reversing, said Midas CEO Dennis Dinkelmeyer. The new LYT product aims at yields as high as 20%, he said. “We've partnered up with the best in the industry such as Edge Capital, RE7 Capital and MEV Capital with more great names coming soon,” Dinkelmeyer said in an interview. “These fund managers are really experts when it comes to yield, whether with T-Bills, basis trades, or other yield sources like market making and arbitrage.” The Midas tokenization platform allows a wide audience exposure to these tokens with a one-click issue and redeem process, Dinkelmeyer said. “In addition, the tokens can be used as collateral in DeFi, starting with Euler and Morpho with more to follow.” Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

Today’s Forbes Daily newsletter covers an inflation update, New York City accuses Trump of revoking funds, Honda and Nissan end merger talks, Chevron announces layoffs and more. The fight against inflation hit a snag Wednesday, as a new report found that prices rose faster than expected last month. The consumer price index rose 3% in January on an annual basis, a larger increase than economists predicted. One item contributed to much of that increase: eggs, which rose 15% from December to January as bird flu outbreaks continue. It’s the largest increase in egg prices in 10 years. The news led to stock and bond selloffs, with all three major indexes falling about 1% in early trading. The hotter-than-expected report also dashed investors’ hopes of further rate cuts. Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images New York City officials alleged Wednesday that FEMA revoked $80 million in grants from the city’s accounts amid a feud with the Trump Administration over the city’s use of federal funds to house migrants. Elon Musk and FEMA’s acting administrator alleged $59 million in now-suspended FEMA funds were being used to house migrants in “luxury” hotels, but city officials pushed back, saying hotel fee payments were not made on luxury hotels. MORE: Attorney General Pam Bondi announced a lawsuit against New York state, Governor Kathy Hochul and two other state leaders over New York’s “green light law,” which allows all New Yorkers over 16 to apply for a driver license or learning permit regardless of their citizenship status. Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan announced on Thursday that they have ended discussions on a merger that would have created one of the largest automakers in the world. Despite calling off the merger, the companies said they still intend to collaborate under a strategic partnership “aimed at the era of intelligence and electrified vehicles,” which was first announced in March last year. Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images Energy giant Chevron will lay off up to 20% of its more than 45,000 employees, the company confirmed to Forbes on Wednesday. Chevron joins a growing list of major firms making job cuts this year, though one report shows layoff announcements declined 40% last month compared to January 2024. Qualified job candidates can afford to be selective when choosing a new employer, and high on workers’ lists are factors like on-the-job training and a culture of productive collaboration and inclusion. To help find employers who meet that criteria, Forbes released its 10th anniversary editions of its America’s Best Large Employers 2025 and America’s Best Midsize Employers 2025 lists. jamel toppin for forbes Junior Bridgeman, an NBA legend who spent 10 seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks, built a fast-food empire before selling most of his restaurants and using the proceeds to become a Coca-Cola distributor. Forbes now estimates he has a net worth of $1.4 billion, putting him in rare air as only three other NBA players have become billionaires—Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and LeBron James. X, formerly known as Twitter, will pay $10 million to settle a lawsuit that was filed by President Donald Trump after his account was banned in 2021, according to the Wall Street Journal. The payout from the Elon Musk-led social media company follows a $25 million settlement from Meta last month to resolve a suit around Trump’s censorship claims, as his Facebook and Instagram accounts were also suspended following the January 6 Capitol attack. Tulsi Gabbard The Senate confirmed Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence on Wednesday, voting largely along party lines despite some bipartisan skepticism about her foreign policy views. Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) cast the sole Republican vote against Gabbard, citing her “alarming lapses in judgement,” including previous controversial comments on the Russia-Ukraine war that many viewed as sympathetic toward Russia. The presidential seal has turned up on a golf marker at a fifth Trump golf course, potentially violating federal law that prohibits its use for commercial purposes. It’s the former president’s latest move to blur the line between public office and private business. President Donald Trump said in a social media post he had a “highly productive” call with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending Russia’s war with Ukraine, the first known conversation between the two leaders since Trump took office. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said earlier Wednesday that negotiations to restore Ukraine’s borders to what they were before 2014 are “unrealistic,” and chasing that goal “will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.” More than 4,400 flights were disrupted as of Wednesday afternoon as a major winter storm system was expected to dump snow and ice on a vast swath of the country. Major U.S. airlines are issuing travel waivers allowing passengers flying in or out of impacted airports to rebook without paying the fare difference. A suspected illegal immigrant is placed in the back of a U.S. Customs and Border Protection border patrol vehicle in 2006. The Department of Homeland Security has asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to deputize IRS agents to help with immigration. Some in the agency fear that moving agents away from that work would decrease compliance and lower collections. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan think tank, claims that taking IRS agents off the complex tax collections cases for which they are trained would reduce the amount of tax the agency can collect—less enforcement means that more people flouting the law would evade detection. ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; PHOTOS BY SEREGRAFF, SERIKBAIB/GETTY IMAGES TOPLINE DOGE is coming for the Department of Defense. After taking the knife to a growing roster of federal agencies and causing widespread panic at others, employees from Elon Musk‘s Department of Government Efficiency are set to arrive at the Pentagon in the coming days, a person briefed on the effort told Forbes. Charged with cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget, they could bring an unprecedented shakeup to America’s sprawling military and its near $1 trillion budget. For decades, legislators on both sides of the aisle have struggled to rein in wasteful defense spending with little success, as the Pentagon has been repeatedly embarrassed by reports of egregious overspending—millions in untracked inventory, failed audits, the infamous $10,000 toilet seats. In an interview before Sunday’s Super Bowl, President Donald Trump said he expected DOGE’s review of the military will find “hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse.” Now, even as Musk’s cost-cutting machine faces mounting court challenges and threats from Democrats, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is rolling out the welcome mat. “I’ve been in touch with Elon Musk, who’s a great patriot interested in advancing the America First agenda,” he said on Fox News Tuesday. “There are plenty of places we want the keen eye of DOGE, but we will do it in coordination.” Hegseth said he would focus on cuts to weapons acquisitions and procurement, climate programs and headcount at headquarters. DOGE staffers will be employed directly by the Defense Department to focus solely on executing its cost cutting mandate, a person with direct knowledge said. WHY IT MATTERS “The existing ecosystem of the prime contractors, and legacy cold war personalities, knew what was coming, and decided to ignore it,” said Chris Miller, the former acting Secretary of Defense and a co-author of Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for the Trump Administration. “And we are seeing the chicken come home to roost.” MORE Military Tech Investors Go Looking For A Trump Bump At Mar-a-Lago The active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy could reduce alcohol cravings among those with alcohol use disorder, a new study suggests. Previous research has suggested that Novo Nordisk’s popular diabetes and weight loss drug could treat alcoholism: 30% : Reduction in drinks consumed among study participants who received the active ingredient semaglutide 30 grams: How many grams of alcohol participants on semaglutide drank during a final drinking session at the end of the experiment, compared to just under 60 grams of alcohol for those who received a placebo 28.9 million: The estimated number of people ages 12 and older who had alcohol use disorder in 2023, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Transitioning to a managerial role for the first time can be challenging, and it’s critical for organizations to support those moving into leadership positions. Many first-time managers try to do everything themselves, have a tendency toward micromanaging, and focus too much on looking good for their boss. Start by practicing self-reflection, focus on learning from people with different views than your own, and spend time figuring out how to motivate others.

02/14 update below. This post was originally published on February 13 Bitcoin and ethereum have diverged in recent months, with the bitcoin price soaring as ethereum struggles—helped by U.S. president Donald Trump’s predicted plans for bitcoin. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price is hovering just under $100,000 per bitcoin after coming within touching distance of $110,000 around mid January while ethereum has fallen sharply from its recent December peak as “dangerous” bubble fears emerge. Now, as a Coinbase executive claims Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity may already be known, Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has quietly confirmed its bought around $2 billion of bitcoin and ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and ethereum ... [+] exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares as the bitcoin price surges. Goldman Sachs loaded up on bitcoin and ethereum ETFs in the fourth quarter, increasing its ethereum ETF holdings by 2,000% and growing its bitcoin ETF holding to over $1.5 billion, according to a regulatory filing. The funds bought by Goldman Sachs included BlackRock’s bitcoin and etheruem ETFs, as well as funds controlled by Fidelity and Grayscale. 02/14 update: Crypto prices have climbed over the last 24 hours, with small gains for bitcoin and ethereum being dwarfed by Ripple’s XRP, which has surged 10% after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged filings from crypto asset manager Grayscale to list spot XRP and the memecoin dogecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “While this doesn’t guarantee approval, it begins a process for public feedback,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note. “Grayscale’s XRP ETF, filed in January and amended in February, is now under review with up to a 240-day approval period. The SEC's acknowledgment is seen as a positive shift from its previous stance, as it shows openness to these products.” The race for the next U.S. spot crypto ETF is now between bitcoin offshoot litecoin, ethereum rival solana, XRP and dogecoin, with Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas predicting earlier this month that XRP and dogecoin ETF bids have a 65% and 75% chance of being approved before the end of 2025. BlackRock led a campaign to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, led by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) which now has just over $60 billion in assets under management. However, the importance of Goldman’s bet on bitcoin and ethereum via ETFs has been played down one analyst. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last year, helped by Wall Street adoption and Donald Trump's ... [+] embrace of bitcoin, ethereum and crypto. “This position by Goldman Sachs, similar to many other banks and hedge funds, is not a net long position,” said Coindesk senior analyst James Van Straten. "This is a strategy that reflects the basis trade, also known as the cash and carry trade, balancing potential profits and risks for bitcoin price fluctuations. The ETFs recently had options approved on them so this is most likely directional hedging." Last month, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealed he’s had discussions with sovereign wealth funds about buying bitcoin and predicted such conversations could catapult the bitcoin price to $700,000 per bitcoin. "If everyone adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per bitcoin," Fink, who led the Wall Street rush into bitcoin and crypto last year via a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), told Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Time Published: 2025-02-13T12:03:46Z
Full Content:
Robinhood (HOOD) shares surged in pre-market activity Thursday after the popular trading app reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates driven by a massive jump in crypto revenue. The company reported $358 million in crypto transaction revenue in the quarter, the highest contribution from digital-asset trading to date, Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday. JPMorgan raised its price target for the stock to $45 from $39, while maintaining its neutral rating. Citi (C) raised its target to $60 from $45 and kept its neutral rating on the stock. Broker Bernstein more than doubled it price objective to $105 from $51 and kept an outperform rating on the shares. The stock jumped 13% to $63.20 in early trading Thursday following results, released after the market closed on Wednesdy. Robinhood said fourth-quarter revenue rose 115% from the previous year to $1.01 billion, beating Wall Street analysts' estimate of $945.8 million, according to FactSet data. Transaction-based earnings increased 200% year-on-year, mainly due to a 700% rise in cryptocurrency revenue. Crypto revenue normally contributes 10%-20% of total revenue, JPMorgan noted. The 46% jump in total cryptocurrency market cap in the period and the increase in Robinhood notional volumes, which were 393% higher quarter-on-quarter, fueled the revenue beat. The company has big plans for its crypto business. "Management seeks to add more tokens, strengthen its wallet offering, add an order book with exchange routing functionality, integrate Bitstamp and explore tokenization longer-term," the report said. Robinhood has benefitted from favorable trends since the start of the year, with "crypto market tailwinds and retail activity remaining strong," Citi said. If this positive backdrop is maintained, the shares are likely to see support, but investors should expect volatility. While the bank has become more positive on the company's fundamental outlook, it said it preferred to wait for a "more reasonable entry point." Bernstein reiterated that Robinhood was the best idea in the broker's global digital assets coverage. It said it expected continued momentum in the first quarter "driven by crypto volatility and a sustained price cycle."

Apptronik said Thursday that it had closed its Series A fundraise at roughly $350 million, with plans to use the funding to scale production of its artificial intelligence-powered humanoid robots. The round was led by B Capital, a venture capital firm chaired by Howard Morgan, and Capital Factory, which connects seed-stage technology firms to angel investors and venture capital. Google (GOOGL) also participated in the round; its DeepMind AI research lab announced a partnership with Apptronik in December. According to Apptronik, the funding will help it scale work on Apollo, its line of commercial general-purpose humanoid robots introduced in late 2023. The Austin, Texas-based firm in March partnered with Nvidia to integrate its tech into Apollo. It showed off the robots last month at CES 2025. “We’re creating the world’s most advanced and capable humanoid robots, designed to work alongside humans in meaningful and transformative ways,” Apptronik CEO and co-founder Jeff Cardenas said in a statement. “[W]e’re shaping a future where robots become true partners in driving progress.” Like other companies working on humanoid robots, Apollo is designed to perform work in factories, where companies can train and test how the robots perform simple tasks. So far, Apptronik, which was founded at the University of Texas at Austin in 2016, has two commercial partnerships. The first is with GXO Logistics (GXO), which also works with Reflex Robotics and Agility Robotics. In June, GXO said Apptronik’s five-foot-eight, 160-pound robots have “great potential to add value throughout the distribution center,” performing repetitive and labor-intensive work. Apptronik’s tech is also being used by Mercedes-Benz (MBGAF) for “low skill, physically challenging” labor, the companies said last March. The automaker is testing one robot at a plant in Hungary. “With expanded deployment planned for 2025, Apollo is poised to transform workplaces worldwide,” Apptronik said in a statement. Last August, Cardenas told Forbes that Apptronik was talking with about 60 potential customers, with a commercial launch planned for the end of this year. Even with the latest round, which took its total cash raised to $376 million from $28 million, Apptronik has far less cash than some of its rivals. Elon Musk’s Tesla (TSLA), which has a market capitalization of more than $1.1 trillion, has been testing its Optimus robots in its factories for months and has started hiring more staff to work on the project. Figure AI last February raised $675 million in a Series B round that included Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Jeff Bezos’ Bezos Expeditions, giving the company a $2.6 billion valuation. CEO Brett Adcock recently said Figure would exit its partnership with OpenAI and announced his firm had signed its second commercial customer, which is “one of the biggest U.S. companies.” Figure, which began working with BMW last year, could potentially ship 100,0000 robots over the next four years, Adcock wrote on LinkedIn.

Title: The State Of DEI: Practitioners Navigate A Shifting Landscape

Big group of people holding hands together making round circle shape. Colorful diverse friend team ... [+] concept, united community or social cooperation cartoon on isolated background. In 2023, a Pew Research Center survey showed that for “a majority of employed U.S. adults (56%), focusing on increasing DEI at work is a good thing,” with women, people of color and other demographic groups with marginalized identities voting in favor of DEI in higher numbers. In less than a month, despite broad public interest in DEI, President Trump has put an end to federal government spending on any efforts that seek to level the playing field for marginalized groups. A mandate that has been taken up by private sector companies, with little protest. Missing from the conversation on the federal government’s ban on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and rapid rollback of DEI among some of the world’s most visible companies is the impact on people who have championed workplace equity. DEI practitioners across the country are grappling with an uncertain future. Kim Flanery-Rye, founder of Inclusion Equals, had anticipated the shift and worked with clients in advance to prepare. "We discussed what their commitment to DEI would look like in different scenarios and how to prepare for potential impacts. We were already seeing the shifts in higher education, so the writing was on the wall. This wasn’t just theoretical; it was happening in real-time." And yet, despite data on the shifting landscape, practitioners feel gutted. "It's painful to see some of the work you and colleagues have done seemingly undone overnight," says Katrina Jones, a senior people and culture leader. For many DEI consultants, the impact has been both financial and deeply personal. "Many of our clients are pausing their DEI efforts" shares Sari De, founder of Nine of Us. "A few, who either are government bodies or who have major government contracts, have broken contracts with us, citing the executive order." Lindsey T.H. Jackson, a Seattle based consultant, echoes these concerns: "Over the past two weeks we have seen many RFPs and leads suddenly disappear. We have also had a handful of clients come to us to abruptly stop their work." For practitioners who are people of color, immigrants, or members of marginalized communities, the chilling effect of these policies extends beyond financial setbacks—it becomes a personal safety issue. De candidly shares, “I am a person of color, a woman, and an immigrant. I'm worried my work will put my citizenship in jeopardy, and I am carrying my US government ID (along with my foreign passport) with me at all times—the grocery store, the school pick-up.” The heightened fear of legal persecution is leading many to reassess their personal and professional choices, weighing risk against commitment to the work. For Flanery-Rye, the past few weeks have been a whirlwind. "I was overseas at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, when the inauguration and the flurry of executive orders came through. Personally, as a DEI and culture practitioner, a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, and a naturalized citizen through adoption, the announcements were confusing, terrifying, and gut-wrenching." The executive orders have left many organizations scrambling, uncertain of the legal and financial risks associated with running programs that prioritize women, queer and trans, and BIPOC employees. Language that was seen as bold, fair, inclusive, is now seen as legally risky communication. Many, especially Fortune 500 companies had been silently retreating over the past year, strategically dismissing employees with DEI titles. While layoffs are often attributed to business needs, many practitioners see a troubling pattern emerging as DEI positions are disproportionately affected. Last year, Microsoft laid off a DEI team, noting DEI was 'no longer business critical', along Meta, Amazon, dozens of non-tech companies, according to Fast Company. While some have chosen to quietly pull back newly made DEI commitments, others are doubling down. “The clients that are doubling down on DEI are actually increasing spending this year, continuing to support their ERGs and reassuring their employees that they will continue to speak up for their rights,” De explains. Jackson sees a similar pattern. “The vast majority of our clients have reached out to assure us that they will fight for their people,” she says. For those wondering how to support DEI efforts in this precarious climate, practitioners offer a clear message: action is needed. “More Upstanders, less Bystanders,” De asserts. “I want folks to feel comfortable getting their phones out when they see ICE detaining folks. I want people to feel like they can question officers when they board public transport or show up at school.” Allies have a role to play. "The ask is almost always the same," says Jones. "I'd like people to speak up, to speak out, to make noise, and join others to find a way forward." Flanery-Rye underscores the importance of economic and social support. "If you have economic power, put your money where it can have the biggest impact. If you have flexible time, use it to volunteer in your local community. If you have a public platform or social influence, use it to amplify voices." Allyship needs to come from leaders with influence on a national and global stage. DEI is more than anti-bias training and employee resource groups. In Assembly Required, David Glasglow, of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, and Stacey Abrams us that DEI includes: A practioner anonymously shared that the field needs a clearer articulation of its value. "As a movement, we must do better to articulate what anti-bias work is all about and whom it serves. I have talked to many executives recently who are looking for language – when I start talking about DEI as supporting those with disabilities, or veterans, they seem shocked. We must do a better job articulating the full scope of this work." Despite the current challenges, practitioners are resolute in their belief that DEI will not disappear—it will evolve. "DEI won’t be erased, but for it to survive, it must evolve," says Flanery-Rye. "The real challenge is finding better ways to connect. It’s about making DEI real and relevant, rooted in lived experiences, backed by data, and communicated through compelling storytelling." DEI practitioners are facing one of the most challenging periods in recent memory, but their resolve is unshaken. As Jones aptly puts it, "This moment has also called out the need to frame the work clearly and pointedly so people understand it. That's an opportunity for evolution, which diversity, equity, and inclusion—and the people who lead this work—are more than capable of." The work will continue, shaped by those who refuse to be silenced. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: An Interview with Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi About Aggregation and Autonomy

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: Good morning, This week’s Stratechery Interview is with Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. Khosrowshahi started his career on Wall Street, before going to work for Barry Diller at IAC. Khosrowshahi took over as CEO of Expedia Group in 2004 and led its spin-off from IAC as a public company. 13 years later Uber, which was in the middle of a series of scandals and a board room coup, came calling, and Khosrowshahi took the opportunity to lead a service that customers loved, but which faced a lot of skepticism about its business model, and a long string of problems with regulators. Khosrowshahi helped right the ship, and led Uber in its 2019 initial public offering. Over the last few years Uber has proven out its business model, resolved its issues with regulators, while continuing to expand its Eats and delivery businesses. The question still remains, however, whether Uber could have been even more dominant with its founder at the helm? In this interview I ask Khosrowshahi about all of this, from his background to Expedia to the drama surrounding his appointment at Uber, including the lessons he learned and what he would do differently. We also spend an extended period of time discussing the next challenge facing the company: autonomous vehicles. Why did Uber give up on its self-driving car program, and why does it think it can compete with offerings from Waymo, Tesla, etc.? We dive into everything from supply and demand dynamics over time and space, to the OEM challenge for autonomous vehicles, to why Khosrowshahi thinks that Uber’s position as an Aggregator means the company is well-positioned for the future.

On to the Interview: This interview is lightly edited for clarity. Topics: Dara Khosrowshahi, welcome to Stratechery. Dara Khosrowshahi: Thank you for having me. This is our first time to talk and we have a lot to get to. I do always like to ask about your background, how you ended up where you are, but I might have to put a time limit on you. It started out with a very talented family that went through a lot of upheaval, and I think that might be the understatement of the Interview series. DK: (laughing) I’ll try to keep it short, yes. We were an immigrant family, we came here in 1978 after the Iranian revolution. My family ran a very big company in Iran, and we all thought all the children were expected to join the family company when the time was right. And then, we had the slight interruption of the revolution that caused us to flee Iran. We were lucky enough to have an uncle who lived in the US with his wife, and they took us into their homes and we got to rebuild our lives, so to speak, in the US. There was a waylay in France along the way, is that right? DK: Yes. We used to go to France for the summer, so at the time no one really knew the changes afoot in Iran. So we thought that we would just leave, go to France while things cooled down, calmed down so to speak. And they never did calm down. Right. Arguably still haven’t. DK: And yeah, I’m arguably still on vacation in France. So the vacation has continued, but we were lucky enough to come to the States and rebuild our lives. And then I had the average suburban childhood. I studied engineering in college, and quickly through that all the way to start a career in New York and finance, working at investment bank, Allen & Company, that you might know, which is a great place. And then, one thing led to another, and I met Barry Diller who was a client of mine, and I remember working for him on a couple of deals and I swore to myself, “If I ever have the chance to work for that guy, I will”, and he gave me the chance to work for him, and I went to become his deal person, so to speak. I moved up in my career with Barry for many, many years. He really has been the greatest business mentor and a great friend as well in my life, and I’ve got everything to thank him for. Was it a great fork in your career that you went to Expedia and not a dating app? DK: (laughing) That was a lucky call. At the time, one of the Expedia founding team, Erik Blachford, was running Expedia and he was a founder, he was a builder. He kind of wasn’t necessarily up for the management gig, so to speak. So he spoke to Barry and he said, “Listen, I’m going to do something more entrepreneurial”. I was the CFO of IAC at the time, and I guess Barry didn’t have anyone better, so he tapped me on the shoulder and I certainly volunteered. I loved travel, I’m very passionate about it, and I took over what was IAC Travel at the time, and as the travel business went through some trouble, IAC decided to spin off IAC Travel into its own entity, Expedia. That was when I become the public company CEO, and it was a trial by fire. I have to say that the early years were pretty rough, but after a while I got the rhythm of it. Barry was the chairman and controlling shareholder of that company, and we built that company in partnership for many, many years and it was a really, really good run for me. What surprised you most about your time at Expedia and the travel business? Was it always clear to you and Barry that this Internet dynamic, where the power is actually going to flow to an asset-lite discovery tool, you marshal all the demand and then supply comes onto your platform, a real inversion of the physical world. Was that clear, or were you discovering that along the way? DK: I think we saw some patterns forming, and I would say the most important model that we saw was actually Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster, if you remember the olden days, Ticketmaster obviously was amalgamating ticketing all over the world, and was selling through two channels, which were the Tower Records physical tickets, and then by phone you’d have to call 1-800-Ticketmaster and wait on the line for two hours to get your Madonna tickets. They opened up a website, and very, very quickly we saw traffic move over to the web. So for us then, at the time, fulfillment on the Internet was a real challenge. We kind of thought, “Well, what looks like Ticketmaster in that it has advanced reservations, booked either in person or through the phone, of a virtual good that didn’t need fulfillment”. Amazon hadn’t demonstrated the incredible capacity to use capital and use incredible skill to build the fulfillment network that I’m kind of a part of now. And so, the model, when you think about that, virtual goods, advanced reservation, no fulfillment needed, physical channel, phone channel, maybe moving onto the Internet, it looked like travel. It’s interesting you mention Amazon, because you had the similar idea to Jeff Bezos, who wasn’t looking to do books specifically he was looking at, “What is the right industry for this new Internet-enabled model?”, but he wanted to do the fulfillment part. But it’s interesting, it’s a similar story where you had a thesis and you were looking for an industry that fit the thesis. DK: Listen, same thing with dating, right? In the olden days on dating, you would call up and you would put your profile on the phone and other people would listen. So again, we were looking for these virtual-type goods and the opportunity to amalgamate a bunch of content in a much, much better way as it related to the Internet, and we found some of the early players, the Expedias of the world, the Hotels.com of the world, the Hotwires of the world. Back then, Barry is a terrific deal person, and I was leading deals for him, so our way of expanding into the category was through acquisition, and we got to see it early. And really, people talk about history not repeating itself as rhyming, Expedia was a rhyme of Ticketmaster, of Match.com, and we just used that patterning to make some early calls in what turned out to be a terrific opportunity for us. By that time, was supply already coming onto the platform organically? Or was there a lot of work to be done in actually signing up hotels and whatnot? DK: Oh, it was a huge amount of work to be done. And the business — actually the Expedia business developed mostly on the air side, so air tickets. Yeah. Easy to deal with, so it was actually easier to sign them up. DK: Exactly. It’s interesting. You start with them, but that meant your margins were worse because you weren’t dealing with that many entities. DK: Totally, and you had industrial switches like Amadeus and Sabre to plug into. Yep. DK: Older APIs, but you could plug into all of the content in the world very, very quickly versus hotels that other than the change, the hotels had to be a ground game, building out sales forces, going out and signing up these hotels, many of which were smaller businesses that had to be introduced to the Internet, they often didn’t have a website, etc. It turned out that while the early penetration of the business and the reason why or the biggest driver around online penetration was air, the business ultimately formed around hotels, because that was fragmented content that you can earn a lot of margin off of versus air that’s pretty consolidated, that relatively is a great eyeball attractor, but not great in terms of transactional economics. Now you just helped me summarize arguably the last decade of Stratechery, so it’s actually a great example. Were hotels on Expedia when you acquired them or was that part of what you worked on? DK: They were just starting to come on, and we acquired both Expedia and Hotels.com, so we had a player that was really strong in air, we had a player that was really strong in hotels, and independent hotels in particular — put it all together to form the new Expedia, which we took public. But the hotel business is the heartbeat of that business and is the vast majority of the revenue of that business. So you have a decade run there. DK: Yeah. You have this massive stock package that’s meant to keep you there for even longer, and then you left for Uber. What happened? What was the story? How did this develop? It was obviously — we all know what was happening on the Uber side, what was happening on the Dara side? DK: It was very unexpected. A headhunter just reached out to me, random call, and at the time, just like you, just like anyone, I was reading about all of the issues happening in Uber in the news. It was almost daily, the various challenges that were coming up there. So when I first got the call, I said, “Heck no, I’m not crazy, I’m not up for this”. But I actually talked to a friend, Daniel Ek from Spotify. And you realize that was eight years ago, by the way. DK: I know. It’s been a long time. DK: It feels like a long time ago. But I had one particular conversation that really shifted me, which was with Daniel Ek, who’s a good friend, and I still remember I was talking to him about my career at Expedia, how happy I was. And he looks at me, he’s like, “Since when is life about happiness? It’s about impact, you can have an impact on Uber, which is a really important company in the world that’s shaping the future of the cities”. And I think to myself, “Oh, my God, this is so obvious, I’ve got to take a shot”. I knew it was going to be uncomfortable. In hindsight, I didn’t quite know how uncomfortable it was going to be. Otherwise, I might not have jumped in. One big story about that is, as I understand it, there was this tense boardroom fight to even select you. DK: Yes. Travis Kalanick supported you, even though you’re like, “You’re not going to be a part of the company”. Was he just trying to get back at Benchmark, or did you just sit down and talk to him and sell him on your vision? DK: I still to this day don’t know exactly what went down at the board. I believe that there were two other candidates. I think it was Meg Whitman and Jeffrey Immelt, at least based on the news, and I think I was the third candidate that was the least objectionable to both sides. Right. DK: And since one side couldn’t win over the other, they kind of went with me, go figure as far as decision-making. But it certainly worked out for me, and I think hopefully it’ll work out for the company as well. You mentioned you took over Expedia from a founder. DK: Yes. And you were a Wall Street guy and then you were a CEO guy. DK: Yeah. And then, now you’re sort of the manager. Would you consider at that moment, did you feel that Uber was ready for that sort of manager? Could you have built Uber? Is there an aspect of maybe there’s some things Uber would’ve done very differently if Travis stayed? People still talk about this in the Valley, do you just tune that all out, or is it something that you think about late at night? DK: Listen, there’s certainly lots of them, could-have-been, would-have-been scenarios. My experience at Expedia taught me how to be an operator. I went through a period where I was a CEO of the holding company, but also running Expedia.com, and that taught me operations, and my background on Wall Street, that taught me a lot about capital allocation, etc. So I think that training really prepared me to come onto Uber and be the on-the-ground technical operator that the company needed, but also understand governance, understand capital allocation, etc. I have a huge amount of respect for Travis and the founding team, because it wasn’t just him who built the company, and they had to take a very aggressive stance as it related to regulations, the taxi unions, etc., and they had to bust through an enormous amount of resistance. I do think that at some point the company got so big and powerful, but was still undertaking, call it upstart tactics, and they weren’t able to make that adjustment, which is, “Hey, we’re no longer an upstart, we now have millions of drivers, it comes with responsibility, we have to have different kinds of discussions with regulators, etc.” — and I think I brought that maturity, in hindsight. You got some really powerful tools to negotiate with cities and governments, which is you have millions of riders and drivers, people depend on you, Travis built those tools. Maybe he wasn’t quite wielding them correctly, so if you have to zoom out, the transition in that regard does make sense. DK: Listen, the handover at the time, it was a difficult time, it wasn’t pleasant. But I got to take over a company that was in some ways in crisis, but a business model and a brand and a very talented team that was just terrific. So while the handover wasn’t pleasant, I’m very thankful for having the opportunity, and I think it will all worked out. So when you came to Uber, I immediately drew a connection between Expedia and Uber, and in this aspect of aggregating demand. And yet, when you talk about Uber now, you were just talking about it in the latest investor meeting, you talk about how Uber is supply-led, and that makes sense when you recall all the fights for drivers with your competitors. Was that a mental shift when you got on the ground, you’re like, “Actually, this is a two-sided network, but maybe the network works a little differently than I expected”? DK: It was definitely a learning. Expedia is an Aggregator, and you need to obviously match supply and demand, but the nature of the supply to Expedia is much more static. When you compare that to Uber, the supply-demand dynamics are so much more dynamic. The ability then, or the necessity to balance supply and demand in a real-time geospatial manner, is just a much bigger challenge. Uber, to some extent, it’s unique as a retailer, which is when we sell something we actually don’t even know — when we sell and price a ride, not knowing what our inventory is — we have to guess the inventory, predict what the inventory is. Every time we do a scan of the marketplace, it’s just a much more complex beast. I did see with Uber it being all about supply, which is as we aggregated supply, ETAs came down, surge came down, the service got better. To some extent, while it’s a simplification, the service sold itself. I do think in hindsight, if I think back to the Expedia days, one of the things that Booking.com, who was a competitor, who is a competitor with Expedia, got more right is that they were very supply-led. Yup. They were on the ground going to all those little hotels. DK: Exactly. Famously, Europe is much more fragmented than the US. DK: Totally. If I could do it all over again, a lesson with Uber is actually the power of aggregating supply. Certainly you need demand, but there are certain aggregation categories where supply brings demand, it brings more eyeballs. That, for example, is definitely true for us as it relates to our rides business, but even more so in the delivery business. Every single restaurant that we add is a new item to sell, but also the more restaurants we have in a particular search, the greater your conversion is. It not only brings in eyeballs, but it also brings in conversion. Those two obviously are multiplicative, which gets to be a much bigger business as well. We’re very supply-led as a company. I think as a manager of a big company, once in a while you get to learn, and I’ve definitely learned my lesson here. Yeah. This is one where I feel like this should have — it’s so clear to me now as you’re saying it. There’s always a bit about Uber that I couldn’t quite place it in the aggregator framework. I think this is exactly it, it’s this aspect of this is actually a supply-driven market, to your point. We’ve seen with Uber being supply-driven, such that the more supply of Uber leads to more demand, as you just said. Do you see a limit to that curve? If all Ubers were free, what would the world look like? DK: Well, you might get rid of personal car ownership, right? There is that. The question is what does that adoption curve look like? Listen, there certainly is a limit to the amount of supply that you can add to a network. We go through seasonal periods where demand is 35% of the peak demand. Let’s say in most markets, March, early in the year is peak demand, and then over the summer you kind of have the summer doldrums, demand goes down, and we actually have to slough off supply, this is a very simplistic picture. The key for us is to add supply over a long period of time, and then be able to push up supply or pull down supply, depending on the particular marketplace balance seasonally, and then based on time of day as well. That’s where the fun of algorithms of the matching and the pricing algorithms come in for us. How has the balance shifted over time? Are you still tweaking it between the price of the ride versus incentives for the driver and how many drives they do, and the non-ride? I don’t want to call it — not marginal, because it’s still marginal in terms of drivers — but it’s not marginal on a per-ride basis. DK: While the supply/demand dynamics are quite variable on a daily basis, you have these big cyclical characteristics that you see in the marketplace. Got it, so you can start putting in incentives, so drivers are coming on, because you know that demand is going to be increasing or whatever. DK: Generally we have an incentive pool that we are moving between — either the incentive pool goes to create demand or supply, based on the marketplace balance. There may be during rush hour the incentives go to build supply. During noon, let’s say, incentives may go to push demand. That’s kind of on a daily basis, but if you think about the big economic cycles, when I took over at Uber, we were oversupplied. Actually, adding supply was not difficult, we were looking to add more demand in terms of newer products, etc. Then, we went to COVID. Post-COVID, actually we were supply constrained. Biggest challenge was to get drivers to feel safe driving someone in the back seat with all of the fear and COVID, etc. With the government stimulus, a lot of people didn’t need to work right after COVID started settling down. Right. DK: That was a period of I’d say two or three years where we were hugely supply constrained, all of the incentive pool went to drivers. If you look today, the marketplace is much more balanced, and it looks like it’s moving towards being a bit more oversupplied, if you want to call that. The incentive pool on a macro basis is moving more towards building out demand and reducing prices for riders, etc., but these are long cycles and we kind of have this pool that’s typically constant. It’s not about managing a P&L, it’s about managing marketplace balance, both short and long term. We talk about the curve going down and people get rid of personal transportation, but when you talk about these incentives and going back and forth, that’s a commitment. It’s like, “I’m going to get rid of a car and take an Uber”, suddenly if the prices don’t feel reliable, because you keep on tweaking with the algorithm, how do you balance the daily versus the seasonal versus the, “We want to change how the way that people actually live”? DK: Oh, you have asked a deeply philosophical and difficult-to-answer question. Generally, one is we want to lower prices over a long period of time because that increases our TAM, the total available market size for us, I think thematically that’s absolutely true. Our flexing prices up and down in a particular market during a particular time is designed to maximize the reliability of your ride. Right. Reliability is more important than price. DK: Correct. ETA in four minutes, getting that ride when you want that ride. On a short-term basis, if you look over let’s say a 16-week experimental period, we can prove that out every single time. I think that the debate that we sometimes have is does surge and the unreliability of price over a longer term basis create a situation where people are less willing to give up their personal car? I think that’s to be debated. Every single time that we look at it, reliability of availability of inventory comes out on top. People understand the idea of surge pricing, they get it. It was an ingenious move by Travis and team to introduce that. I think it’s something that while we try to minimize is actually feature of the marketplace, not a bug. Yeah, and it’s sort of a customer education that happened over the long run. DK: Totally. You had the misfortune of having to manage Uber through COVID, but was there a bit where you have had the fortune of managing Uber in a world of high interest rates, relatively speaking, and this assumption of, “Oh, anyone could spin up a competitor” — actually, no you can’t. You have competitors with say, DoorDash and delivery, we can get to that, but there’s not going to be a new entry in the market. DK: The free capital period of the market was a really challenging time actually. For me as a manager, I managed a public company, return on invested capital was something that was incredibly important. That was my world, the discipline of profitability, etc., and I think it was one of the reasons why the board brought me in. To some extent, while the COVID experience and high interest rates made for a much more unfriendly environment for operators, they separated the wheat from the chaff. Yeah. It sucks to go through, but it sucks way worse for the weaker competitors. DK: Yeah, totally. At the same time, I would also tell you that overcapitalization reduces execution discipline. We will have engineers build out a feature, it’ll take three months, and it might optimize the marketplace by like 0.6% or 0.7%. That’s a huge win for us. Hugely celebrated, incredibly sophisticated algos to achieve those kinds of wins. Then, in the olden days, someone would just raise $200 million and just blow you out of the water. It didn’t matter all of the art and the craft of building the marketplace. Yes, it did matter, but it got lost in the macro of money sloshing around in the marketplace. I think the market that we’re in right now, appropriate returns on capital, etc., the consolidation of the marketplace, a bunch of competitors who are competing very, very aggressively profitable— Well, this is the whole thing, I was so mad about the whole 2017 era, because I had planted my flag early that there are meaningful network effects here, Uber is going to win. DK: Yes. Then, the problem with 2017 wasn’t just the management upheaval, but also your primary competitor in the US got a huge infusion of capital, because people were like, “Well, maybe Uber’s going to go under, we want in”. It’s like it delayed the inevitable. I’ve been gratified to see things mostly working out as I thought they would in the long run, it just took five years longer than it should have. DK: Value creation was in money raising, not spending it wisely. Now it’s the other way around, which I think is the way the world should be. Yeah. Well, I think in a lot of this conversation we’ve actually laid down a lot of the parameters for — and I’m going to have to try to play devil’s advocate here because I am I think more on your side in the way the market’s going to shake out with autonomous cars when and if they come along. DK: Sure. You’re doing partnerships with different autonomous driving companies in different cities. Why don’t you give me your high-level pitch on how you see this market? Then there’s a bunch of specifics I do want drill down into. DK: Yeah, definitely. Listen, I don’t think it’s an “if”, it is a “when”, and AV is a huge opportunity for the entire marketplace. It is. These robot drivers are going to be safer. I think that they have the opportunity at scale, and scale, it’ll take a while to get to scale, to reduce the price per ride and increase the TAM of this marketplace, trillion plus dollars. We think it’s an enormous, enormous long-term opportunity. Now, a couple of things have to happen before that opportunity actually turns into commercial business. When I say commercial, I mean something that can pay back for itself versus spend a bunch of money. That was 2017 era, right? Is it the 2025 era in San Francisco? DK: Well, it could be. It could be, right? But I do think that the market has changed, and I certainly hope it has. First you need a consistently superhuman safety record. It’s not good enough for a robot driver to be better than a human driver, it’s got to be multiple times better than the human driver. I think the capacity for society to accept human failure is much more than machine failure. Yeah. You went through this early on. DK: Absolutely. Did the fatality in Phoenix, did that change your mind as far as getting out of the autonomous vehicle market, or were you sort of already on that way and that sealed the deal? DK: I think we were leaning that way. It was certainly a very, very important factor in our determination, but I think a couple of issues were more paramount. One is we’re in the middle of COVID, so all of a sudden capital was much more dear. We went from losing $2 billion a year to losing $4 billion a year, which is pretty scary. My job is to make sure the company survives, and this was a significant money burning part of the operation. The other issue that was a big one was that even though we were developing ATG [Advanced Technologies Group] to some extent separately, we treated them as arms length, we have the marketplace separate from ATG, the other players with whom we wanted to partner, like Waymo, didn’t believe us. They didn’t want to partner up with a platform that was also a competitor. It was a little bit of a fork in the road, which is either we had to go vertical or we had to have the platform play, we couldn’t have our cake and eat it too. Then the last I would tell you is Uber is hard as an algorithmic software, software and operations company. Beautifully asset-light. DK: Yeah. Hardware was not our superpower. At some point, companies have to know their superpower. There are very few companies in the world who are great at hardware and software. Tesla, Apple are probably two of the leads, it’s very difficult to pull off. The accident, capital, how the business was shaping, you either had to make a bet on vertical or platform. We wanted to make a bet on platform, and then just superpower, were the four reasons why we decided to get out of it. It reminds me of the Netflix story of they basically built Roku and then spun it out. It’s interesting, because you have a lot of the similar dynamics. They didn’t want to have to compete with — they wanted to be on cable boxes and on all the other sort of devices out there. In the long run, setting them up, I think, potentially to gather up their foes who try to go vertical in the long run, but that’s the wrong company. We’re on Uber, I interrupted your story. You said, number one, superhuman safety record. DK: A superhuman safety record. Second, obviously you’ve got to work with regulators on the ground and you’ve got national regulations, state regulations, city regulations to kind of clear a pathway and I think safety is a big one. How does that differ around the world, or is this where US federalism is going to be a big advantage, or are there actually countries that are going to be ahead? DK: I think that the US generally is one of the leads. We’re seeing the Middle East open up, but it’s going to be very inconsistent as far as how regulations and countries and cities open up. Obviously we are in discussions with all of them so that we can be a part of that launch going forward, but it is going to take a while. And listen, these are really important discussions that we have to have with regulators, especially on the safety side as to what’s good enough. So that is moving, but it’s moving slowly. Third is you need to have a cost-effective scaled hardware platform, and right now there aren’t that many, there aren’t those platforms that have the redundancy, that have the compute, that have, for AV, that have the sensor kits, etc., for AV. It’s going to come in three to four years, but right now, over the next two to three years, that hardware platform, you could say with the exception of Tesla, it doesn’t exist. Then fourth, you need great on-the-ground operations. This is an on-the-ground game, city-by-city depots, cleaning, charging, everything that you need to do on a day-to-day basis. And then fifth, you need a high utilization network that can manage variable demand in a flexible way. We think the best way to do that, and certainly in the early days, is a hybrid of this base layer of autonomous supply, so to speak. That is then, on top of that, you’ve got humans who come in and out during peaks. The great thing about humans is, while they will eventually be more expensive on a cost-per-mile basis than let’s say a machine, you only pay for their utilization when they’re actually working, whereas with an AV, you pay, it’s kind of fixed, so just like you see in energy right now, well, you need a base layer of gas and then the electric grid then can handle the flex up and down with some of the newer energy sources, the same thing is going to be true. You’re going to need a base layer that’ll be AV, and then you’re going to need variability to meet high demand periods, and that will be ultimately we think a hybrid network of AVs and humans. Yeah, obviously you’re the ones that have the variable supply. Speaking of the network possibilities before, I’m on board with that, I should be a better devil’s advocate here. But let’s grant you this, you are the Aggregator sitting on top of the stack. I’m very curious to think through what do those layers, some of which you just listed, look like. So let’s take the actual cars, is the software stack and the hardware made by the same company or the different company? How do you see that playing out? DK: Excepting Tesla, it’ll probably be different. So if I look at the stack, it actually kind of looks like the hotel business, I’ll expand that in a second. Or, let’s look at the hotels for a second. Right, you’ve got the brands and the owners. DK: Well, you have the demand layer, which can be Expedia, it can be Booking.com, it could be Marriott. Then you have the brands themselves, whether it’s Marriott or an independent, then you have an operator. The operators, these are teams, management teams, sometimes Marriott is an operator of a hotel, sometimes there’s actually these local management companies as well, that’s an operator. Then there’s the asset owner, these are REITs [real estate investment trust]. Marriott doesn’t own almost any hotels whatsoever, these financial partners own the hotels, and then you obviously have the financier. We think that same thing is going to happen in AV. You have the network layer that’s Uber, that’s Lyft, it could be Bolt, it could be Waymo too, they have the wherewithal of also going direct. Then you have the driver. To me, that’s kind of like the brand, which is the Marriott driver or the Waymo driver. Then you have the operator, the management company. This is us or could be Moove.io, which is a partner of ours. Actually 15% of our inventory today come from fleet operators that are on the ground in these cities, so we think we can move them over to managing AVs very, very easily. Then you’re going to have the vehicle owners, and then you’re going to have financiers as well. Ultimately we think OEM manufacturers, most OEM manufacturers are going to have different software providers providing AV sometimes on an exclusive basis, sometimes on an non-exclusive basis. A GM, Tesla are going to develop it in house, but then many other players are going to license it, whether from a Waymo or from a Wayve or other companies as well, so you’re going to see a bunch of models. As the business financializes, as these layers come up, the player who can drive the greatest utilization of these really expensive assets called cars are going to be very, very valuable, and that’s certainly the part that we play in addition to the local operations level. Do we have an OEM problem? I think one of the things that you see with China’s developing auto market is basically it’s starting to look like the computer market, where you just have these basic platforms that can be then customized and accessorized, and then software defined on top of them can be churned out. They’re much simpler. You can have very small ones, you can have very large ones, but it’s all like a recipe in a box. In the West we have all these OEMs whose expertise is around the engine and is building these integrated platforms that don’t scale down to a $10,000 car or $5,000 car or $15,000 or whatever the price needs to get to. Are we stuck, especially if we’re putting 100% tariffs on Chinese cars? DK: Well, I think that the innovation going on in China or in the OEM space is extraordinary. You go visit their factories and the people who work in these car factories, they used to work at Foxconn. You’re absolutely right. They manufacture phones, now they’re manufacturing- Foxconn itself is making cars. DK: It’s absolutely extraordinary. And they, I think, have absolutely taken a leap ahead of any of the Western manufacturers. Will the US have access to that content, if you want to call it that? That’s a question mark, but there’s no question that the Chinese outside of the US have a huge advantage. There are obviously companies like Tesla who have taken similar approaches, I do think that the US OEMs have to make that shift. One of the surprises for me as I’ve watched the AV space over the past couple of years is, five years ago, if you asked me as to the most important success factor in scaling OEMs, commercializing AV, it was actually the software, the software was the biggest challenge. The heuristics, the data, the modeling, the simulation, etc. It looks like there are many, many players who are going to make it to the finish line on the software. Now actually building scalable OEM platforms with the compute, with the sensor kit, with the redundancy that you need in the hundreds of thousands, that’s going to be the next challenge, and the Chinese players are certainly ahead of the pack there, although there are many players in Asia, in Korea and Japan who we think are more than up for it as well. Well, but that’s the problem, hundreds of thousands is a very big number for this space, but in the context of the global auto market, it’s not very big. Is there actually a bit where if the US gains this capability, it might actually end up being a new player? DK: I think that there is a chicken-and-egg question, and I think ultimately the market for this software is going to be in personally owned vehicles and rideshare. I think you’re right, which is if rideshare is the only market out there, it’s going to be subscale, but I think 10 years from now, every single new car sold is going to come with some kind of FSD software. Right, but what do you want from a rideshare car, I can imagine being very different from what you want from a personal vehicle, or do you think there won’t be that much difference? DK: Totally. Well, I think those are tunable. So for a personal owned vehicle, you may not have LIDAR, or other LIDAR is very, very cheap. For a rideshare vehicle that’s going to have a lot of miles where safety is incredibly important, a $300, $400 solid state LIDAR kit is absolutely necessary. The newer generation of AV software is looking like it’s much more generalizable to different hardware configs and different sensor configs as well. So I think ultimately you’re going to have platforms that the Hyundai’s of the world or the BYD’s of the world build, and there’ll be tweaks for personal ownership and there’ll be tweaks for fleet ownership, so to speak. I don’t think that’s going to be an issue, but getting to scale is going to take some time. Is there any concern where the US might be pretty forward from a regulatory perspective, but because we don’t have access to these OEM platforms, it actually ends up being the rest of the world that gets to this autonomous state first just because they have access to the hardware and we don’t? DK: I do think that the rest of the world has an advantage in hardware chiefly because of China and the US has to develop it, and today the US is behind. So you did mention the fleet aspect. Right now you have this deal with Waymo, take Atlanta for example, you are going to be responsible for fleet management. Are those going to be gig workers, are you going to hire them, or is this just a temporary thing, you envision outsourcing this in the long run? How are you thinking about that layer? Right now you sort of outsource that to the drivers for free, it’s a great model, but now you have to actually pay someone to do it. DK: As I said previously, we work with a bunch of fleet managers all around the world, and one of our leading fleet managers is actually going to be operating with us in Waymo, in Austin and Atlanta, so we will bring that demand layer. We’re going to really drive very, very high utilization of these Waymos. Waymo brings a software layer and obviously the brand that people really, really love, and then our fleet partner Moove is going to be operating these fleets locally as well, so it’s a team effort and we’re excited. I mean, we think this launch is going to be absolute dynamite. Is there a bit where almost your biggest risk factor is interest rates in the long run? Because in the short term, if it’s a Tesla or it’s a Waymo, they have to build out these fleets to even gain baseline capacity, much less even attempt to reach into higher demand areas. It’s all fixed costs, it needs high utilization, which drives them into your arms because you have the most customers, you have the cheapest customer acquisition, all these advantages that you’ve talked about. But, if suddenly they can develop the wherewithal to stomach losses for, I don’t know, I mean the Waymo share in San Francisco seems pretty solid right now where they’re not necessarily being fiscally disciplined, is that a real risk factor for you? DK: Listen, if you don’t care about economics, then business model logic, that doesn’t matter, but at some point you need economics to work in order to scale, and in a world where certainly if the cost of capital is high and these cars are relatively expensive, the player that’s able to drive the highest utilization of these vehicles is going to have the lowest cost of capital. The player who works with us is going to be able to expand into every single market very, very quickly, will be first to market and being first to market matters, and I think those two elements, which is lowest cost of capital, ability to scale fastest, are going to play to the advantage that we bring in terms of being the best partner for AV in the world. So we’re pretty confident of our position. But I do think this is still, there’s a lot of experimentation that’s going on in this marketplace. Any new market that’s developing at very, very low unit volumes with AV right now, I think people tend to kind of take those models- Over-extrapolate on them. DK: Yeah, over-extrapolate. Yeah, because who cares if you lose 20 bucks a ride on a small number of rides. But if you’re doing 33 million rides a day, well, losing 20 bucks a ride is a problem there. You’ve got to start making money. I have two questions on that. On these potential vertical competitors, I think the experience of Waymo is delightful. DK: Oh, it’s great. I took my first Waymo and then I had to go back to the Grand Hyatt at SFO, which the Waymo did not go to at that point, I’m not sure if it does yet, but instead of taking an Uber, I took Waymo to the edge of Waymo’s territory, and then I switched to an Uber. I think that the question is, of course maybe that wears off over time, you get used to it, but it’s nice to be by yourself. Is there a challenge where people already have the Uber app, that’s a big advantage for you, they can go to one app and they can always get a ride, and hopefully it’s autonomous, but if autonomous isn’t available, you have the human drivers to scale and it’s so much more convenient, or are you concerned that the user experience will make users multi-home in a way that they’ll check Waymo first and then go to Uber? DK: I think it remains to be seen. Ultimately, what we’ve seen over and over again is that the ride is a bit of a commodity. You want to go from point A to B, the feature is where you’re going. Well the more it’s a commodity the better for you. I don’t live in San Francisco, so it was not a commodity for me, but I talked to people who were like, “Yeah, you forget about it very, very quickly”, so I’ll digress. DK: And it is a delightful experience. And it’s nice being alone, it’s nice listening to your own music and not having to ask for permission, so the experience is absolutely terrific. Over a period of time, we think that the feature is where you’re going and the player who can, again, get you where you’re going in the way that you want to, reliably, at the lowest price, at the lowest ETA, is going to play a big part in the development of this marketplace, and ultimately we think there are going to be multiple players. Waymo is absolutely in the lead, they are a great brand. They are setting the safety standard for everybody, but what we’re seeing is many players are solving this issue, and ultimately there’s going to be a choice of taking a Waymo, taking a Nuro, taking a WeRide, or taking a Baidu RoboTaxi as well. That choice is going to come in for consumers, and I do think the Aggregator model certainly would be helpful for all of those companies to succeed. It’s hard for me to push you too hard, because this is my theory as well. DK: (laughing) We need a third person to disagree with us, right? Well, is there a concern that Uber today is Expedia in hotels? Supply is highly fragmented. Yes, you have the occasional fleet operator, but they’re small enough, you don’t have to necessarily treat them any differently, but in an AV world, now you’re dealing with airlines. The margin compresses, because you’re not negotiating against that many people? DK: Yeah. I think if you look at it, there are two ways of looking at this, which is right now, general take rate for us on a global basis is about 20%. We take 20%, we pay the driver 80%. If you just look at it mathematically, that means that if we drive a utilization benefit of 25%, we’re paying for ourselves. The actual utilization benefit that we see in the markets in which we operate early on is much higher than that 25%, so any player should take that 80%, because the benefits of, instead of a ten-minute pickup to the next pickup, it’s a two-minute pickup, the benefits of utilization more than pay for themselves. So, economically, we’re sitting in a very, very good place, and my experience is, over a long period of time, markets move to the right economics of the model regardless of supply and demand, short term. They move there, so from a utilization standpoint, we are in great, great shape. Now, that presumes that there are going to be multiple providers who are able to play AV. This is the third time you’ve anticipated my next question, which is if can we get to this world, which usually there’s going to be one player at the nexus of a value chain, and they’re going to garner most of the profits, and everything around them gets commoditized and that’s the vision you laid out. It’s a vision that makes sense to me. Does this mean, though, that actually your potentially biggest problem might be Tesla? Because you mentioned before, they’re going to be an integrated player from the car to the software. You can imagine Elon’s like, “No, you’re going to use the Tesla app, I think I have the largest bullhorn in the world, I can drive customer acquisition on my own”, and that, even if it’s reckless, and you’ve said you’d love to partner with them, I’m sure you would, but that is ultimately the, if not a threat, at least the airlineification, maybe more than you would like. DK: Yeah listen, no one wants to compete against Tesla or Elon, if you can help it. Their capabilities are pretty extraordinary, but I think the same economic laws apply to them. Ultimately, if Tesla puts their cars on our network, we already have 150,000 drivers who are driving Teslas, and if they get FSD, they’d love to plug it into Uber as well. Then, that Tesla that is both on Uber, and by the way, they could be both on Uber and the network, that is going to create much, much more revenue. Ultimately, that’ll increase the value of the Tesla so that the residual value of that car improves, and if they don’t do that, there’ll be some other OEM that does it. So it all comes back to revenue generation, you have a box with wheels, you want to maximize the revenue of that box in order to reduce your cost of capital, and economic laws apply to Tesla, just as they do to any other car company. To some extent, you look at the food business. I’ll go there, right? McDonald’s has its own app, and has an incredible brand, has a lot of capital, has terrific reach. They still work with Uber Eats and DoorDash, because they want to drive utilization of the box called the restaurant, that same economic value is going to be true going forward. Ultimately, we’re hoping that my charm and the economic argument gets Tesla to work with us as well. If they want a direct channel, no problem. Hopefully the charm doesn’t matter! I’m going to come back to that, that’s actually my last question, but before I get there, you mentioned the food delivery business. Uber Eats. DoorDash is leading the market. What would you have done differently looking back? Do you chalk that up to, “The company was in upheaval, we were putting out fires left and right, we were selling off businesses everywhere”, is there a world in which Uber Eats is in the dominant position, as opposed to being in second place? DK: Well, we always want to be in first place, and while we’re in second place in the US, in many places around the world, we’re the number one player. We’re getting much stronger international business. Hey, I use Uber Eats, basically every day. DK: I know. I’m very familiar with this. DK: I’m just saying, and we’re gaining category position in ten out of our top markets. I think last quarter, actually, Uber Eats made more money in terms of EBITDA than DoorDash. By the way, I could say the whole, “Changing your lifestyle”, that is the case in Taiwan. DK: It is extraordinary. The combination, number one, scooters are so much better for delivery than cars. DK: Yes. Number two, just the density, and the way Taipei is laid out is actually very unique. There’s no centralized area, so there’s food everywhere, and all the way around you, but the way the response in the market, there’s just a huge swathe of restaurants that don’t exist anymore, but they’re only on Uber Eats. It’s not ghost kitchens, there are some ghost kitchens where they’ve created for Uber Eats, but it’s like all your old favorites, their storefront is gone, but they’re still on Uber Eats. It’s been pretty transformational. DK: If the world looked like Taiwan, Uber Eats would be two to three times larger in terms of the frequency, it’s pretty extraordinary. But coming back to the competition against DoorDash, I do think that one thing that they got right was really focusing on the suburbs. If you look in the US, in terms of the suburbs, it’s actually 60 plus percent of the marketplace. Uber has always been a really urban market, we grew up in cities, that’s where we already had the liquidity of the marketplace, and Uber Eats was kind of — they drive people, drive stuff as well. It was an offshoot, so I think DoorDash got the suburban family first, we got the urban 20-something year old first. We’re now kind of coming into each other’s markets. DoorDash’s market, the suburbs turned out to be larger than the urban markets, but for us, suburbs and less dense markets, actually, not only are there a huge opportunity in learning for Uber Eats, not just in the US, but all over the world. We’re going into secondary cities, tertiary cities, but it’s actually a really big opportunity with Uber. As we started expanding Eats into the suburbs, we’re seeing that there’s also Uber demand there. So actually, moving into these less dense cohorts and neighborhoods, big, big, is a huge opportunity for Uber Eats, but also Uber as well, which is I think we got another three to five years of penetration ahead of us. You looked in the last quarter, Eats actually accelerated its gross bookings level, so it’s going to be a dog fight with DoorDash, but they’re a strong competitor. We’re a really strong competitor, and I’m very, very confident that the network effect that we have, Rides, Eats, along with the Uber One Membership program that’s now 30 million strong, ultimately is going to come out on top of the full competitive field in food and grocery. Was there a little bit of a paradox you just identified there though, where you are talking about, and the first thing you mentioned on your last earnings call, was the cross-selling and people that are doing multiple transactions across both Rides and Eats, but at the same time, did that make it hard to prioritize and focus, whereas DoorDash had an advantage by doing just food, and was that a meaningful differentiator? Is that still a meaningful differentiator? DK: I think it’s very difficult for companies to do more than one thing or build more than one brand. Not only are we multi-service, but we also expanded internationally much faster than, let’s say, the DoorDash’s of the world and many other competitors of the world, and on a short-term basis, it’s much harder. You’ve got to build more services, you have to generalize for the international markets. It takes longer to build things, but over the long term, we think it’s a much stronger strategic position to be in. Again, DoorDash, they do only one thing, we think our superpower is in the platform. Their superpower, you could say, is in their focus. Every piece of evidence that we’re seeing is that the platform is winning against the whole ecosystem. Obviously, the markets that we’re chasing are much, much broader than just the DoorDashes out there. So final question, you’ve talked a lot about in the long run, you believe in the economics, and so I’m going to dismiss your charm a bit. It doesn’t matter, sorry, the economics are going to sort of rule the day and bring this market to you, it’s going to be an Aggregator market, it’s going to be commoditized, all the bits and pieces of a vertical player is going to have to be on your platform to utilize their assets properly. Very compelling. Is there a bit where, when you think back to your tenure, you go back to 2017, and you go through all the controversies, that actually at the end of the day, I’m sure you did a great management job, so I guess I’m dissing your charm twice in this question, that Uber pulled through because its externalities are actually just so great and it’s hard to get away from? I mean, this is a kissing your rear-end question, but I’ve always been such an Uber advocate, I think in part because I came from a relatively small town, I come from a state with a lot of drunk drivers. There’s these aspects of being able to get a ride, there’s three taxis in the city of Madison. They’re always at the airport, and they cost like $100. It’s been transformational, and that’s why you got regulars on board in the first place. People loved you and they would go to bat for you. Is that the key thing? I mean, I feel kind of embarrassed. I’m asking such a leading question that’s so great for you, but it feels like the structural argument you’re making is actually, this is the argument for Uber as a whole. DK: It is, and I got to take over a great company. If you remember at the time, there was WeWork, and there was Uber, and we were both burning a bunch of money. WeWork turned out to be a bad business model, Uber turned out to be a great business model. So, while yes, were there cultural challenges, were there governance challenges, were there brand challenges early on? Yes, yes, and yes, but the business model itself, the service was a service that people depended on. We’ve got eight million drivers who are choosing to be on our platform to make money whenever they want, where they want, etc. It’s a very, very powerful platform that I got to take over, and I think the power is only multiplied during these seven years, and hopefully I can keep it going for a few more years at least. Until the next company is in crisis. DK: (laughing) I’m staying at this one for a while. At least I hope I do. Famous last words! DK: It’s a lot of fun.

Title: America's biggest companies are waging a stealth campaign to dismantle DEI

How companies from Pepsi to Disney are quietly dismantling their diversity initiatives In 2020, it was all the rage for corporations to pledge their allegiance to diversity and inclusion. In 2025, it's very much in vogue to declare that they're no longer into that kind of stuff. Companies such as Target, Walmart, McDonald's, Google, and Meta have recently announced major rollbacks of their DEI efforts. In corporate America, nixing employee resource groups is the new version of posting that Black Lives Matter black square five years ago. On the flip side, companies including JPMorgan and Costco say they're sticking to their DEI guns despite the Trump-fueled headwinds. It's tempting to paint an us-versus-them — or them-versus-them — picture: the DEI backpedalers versus the DEI warriors. But there's a quieter and potentially larger group of businesses taking a different course: subtly burying DEI efforts. They're not putting out press releases or big memos saying they're axing programs aimed at hiring diverse candidates or tracking supplier demographics. Instead, they've taken a look at the legal, political, and cultural landscape and made the calculation that it's better to silently pull back on DEI-related language for now. "Many companies in America have always wanted to promote diversity in the workplace in a manner that's lawful, and that hasn't changed," said Rebecca Baker, a partner at the law firm Vinson & Elkins in its labor and employment group. "What has changed is there's a cloud of ambiguity as to what is lawful." Companies are hoping to fly under the anti-DEI crowd's radar at a moment when the movement feels more emboldened than ever. They're afraid to put a target on their backs, legal or otherwise. Despite some of the attention-grabbing headlines, this might be how DEI really dies — quietly, in the shadows. While several companies have made splashy announcements about their DEI plans, others have simply scrubbed mentions of them, including in their annual 10-K financial reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For their latest filings, it appears that a lot of publicly traded companies did a CTRL+F+DELETE on "diversity." Legally, companies have to disclose some information about their workforces in their annual reports, such as how many people work for them, but they're not required to say anything about diversity and demographics. It had become popular over the past decade or so for companies to make such disclosures anyway, especially in the wake of George Floyd's murder in 2020. But that's shifted as companies have become increasingly worried about being viewed as "woke" or overly progressive. General Motors, for example, cut the DEI section of its annual report. In its 2023 report, the automaker said it aimed to be "the most inclusive company in the world" and touted its diverse board of directors and dozen employee resource groups. In its 2024 report, that section was gone. PepsiCo's latest filing scrapped a breakdown of its workforce demographics as well as a line about how it believed its "culture of diversity, equity and inclusion is a competitive advantage that fuels innovation, enhances our ability to attract and retain talent and strengthens our reputation." The soda maker did, however, retain a mention of pay equity. Disney shortened its DEI section, in part removing mentions of employee development programs and fellowships for underrepresented talent while adding a mention of Heroes Work Here, an initiative to hire and train US military veterans. Mondelez International scrapped its section dedicated to diversity and inclusion in its workforce. Philip Morris International significantly shortened what had previously been its DEI section, removing goals for gender and racial representation in its management and mention of employee resource groups. The section is now named "collaborative culture." Some firms are taking a subtler approach. Pinterest, for example, renamed the "inclusion and diversity" section of its report "inclusion and belonging." Chipotle swapped "diversity, equity & inclusion" for "culture and inclusivity," though it continues to include breakdowns of its workforce by gender, ethnicity, and race. The companies mentioned did not respond to a request for comment or declined to comment on the record, with the exception of Philip Morris, which said it valued its "global workforce" and was "focused on fostering a fair and collaborative workplace in an environment that provides opportunities to all employees for growth and professional development." "Prior to Trump taking office, there was already a lot of pressure on DEI," said Andrew Jones, a senior researcher at the Conference Board's ESG Center. "Lots of companies obviously realize that DEI became a very politically loaded term, controversial term, even a slightly toxic term in terms of the legal and political scrutiny." Last spring, a Wall Street Journal analysis found that dozens of companies were changing their DEI descriptions in their annual reports amid heightened legal and political scrutiny. A new analysis by NPR this year found that several companies were axing references to DEI altogether. Beyond the filings, data provided by AlphaSense, a financial information and insights company, indicates that mentions of DEI have sharply declined on earnings calls and in other public investor-related communications over the past couple of years. Businesses are increasingly hush-hush about anything that might even have a whiff of DEI, lest they poke the anti-woke bear and become the next Bud Light or worse. "If you're a CEO, you've got the general counsel in one ear saying you're going to get sued or you're going to use lose contracts," said Alison Taylor, an associate professor at New York University's Stern School of Business who wrote the book "Higher Ground: How Business Can Do the Right Thing in a Turbulent World." "And then you've got the public-affairs person in the other ear saying here's who's yelling at you on social media." Baker said companies were increasingly including mentions in their risk-factor disclosures of potential controversies around their employment practices and social initiatives. "So they're flagging that 'Hey, investors should understand that the DEI climate is in flux right now and we can't exactly predict what might happen. And some of our employment practices, although we believe they're fully legally compliant, may ultimately end up a target of litigation,'" she said. Corporate America was nervous before the election about the political tides turning, given the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling against affirmative action in college admissions and the growing influence of conservative activists such as Robby Starbuck. Now, Trump 2.0 has sent many of them into a silent panic mode. The president positioned himself as a fierce opponent of almost DEI, determined to root it out of the federal government and, if he can manage it, private industry. The crusade is clearly having a chilling effect across the business community. In an executive order signed on his first day in office, Trump set out to end what he called "radical and wasteful" DEI programs in the federal government. The next day, in a separate executive order, he revoked an order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 that barred government contractors and subcontractors from engaging in employment discrimination. Many government contractors are public companies. But even for those that aren't, the order lays out steps for "encouraging the private sector to end illegal DEI discrimination and preferences." It instructs federal agencies to identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of private companies. In effect, they're hunting for lists of names to sue, and no one wants to be one of them. "There is a valid fear of companies having a target on their back based on how they outwardly promote DE&I," said Renai Rodney, a counsel in Ropes & Gray's litigation and enforcement practice group, "which is unfortunate, because while there's certain things in the executive order that companies should certainly be mindful of, the underlying law has not changed." The chaos and confusion is part of the point. The letter of the law isn't any different — it's always been illegal for companies to implement quotas or require a certain proportion of their workforce to be a specific race or gender. The law's interpretation and enforcement, however, have clearly undergone a reversal. Federal contractors run the risk of the Department of Justice going after them to assert that their DEI policies violated the False Claims Act, which prohibits contractors from defrauding the federal government. Major companies could be accused by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. The law was meant to prevent businesses from declining to hire someone because they're part of a minority group; now it's being used against businesses by people who say they're being overlooked because they're in the majority. Jenny Yang, who served as an EEOC chair and commissioner from 2013 to 2018 and now heads the Urban Institute's Workplace Equity Initiative, said companies facing claims that they discriminated or used ill-defined "illegal DEI" practices may very well have a good case in court and win. But going to court costs money, and any battle is likely to draw attention, so they may be inclined to give up before there's even a fight. "A lot of this really does not have the law behind it, and it's not likely to survive a motion to dismiss," she said. "But companies don't want to spend the money even defending against the lawsuit, and they don't want the reputational harm, or they don't want their board to get upset." Employers may proactively examine programs they think could be subject to legal scrutiny, such as scholarships or fellowships aimed at underrepresented communities. "It may not actually make it to a legal decision, but they decide, well, we'll settle this by opening up that program to everyone and not just groups," Rodney said. "Those haven't been ruled unlawful, but companies are either deciding we don't want a bad decision on the books or we don't want to use resources to fight this, so we'll just change the terms of the program." It isn't just the federal government that companies have to worry about — conservative state authorities, legal groups, and individuals with big platforms are also freaking them out. In mid-2024, Missouri's attorney general sued IBM, alleging that it was using unlawful racial and gender quotas in employment. The Trump-aligned group America First Legal has filed several complaints, including against Southwest Airlines and American Airlines, over their DEI practices. Texas' attorney general, Ken Paxton, has told financial institutions such as BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup to watch it on DEI or face enforcement actions. A police pension fund in Florida is suing Target, saying it wasn't made aware of the risks of the retailer's DEI initiatives and potential backlash. "In terms of what's the actual legal risk, I think we're seeing it now morph into Title VII discrimination claims from individual employees, activism by Republican state attorneys general," Baker said. "Now we're waiting to see exactly what comes out of the president's executive order." Just because companies quietly disappear mentions of their DEI policies doesn't mean the work can't continue. They can practice without preaching, and many will. If one is to believe companies meant it when they said they cared about fostering diverse workplaces, then presumably none of that went away overnight. The issue is that, cynically, it's sometimes hard to believe these companies were that dedicated to the idea in the first place. "Many initiatives weren't always measurable," Jones said. "There were a lot of public commitments without really thinking through how they were measured and implemented." Corporate values often seem like a PR stunt — X supports the troops, Y wants to end racism — based on where companies calculate the "right" answer is at any given moment. What's "right" often means "whatever will generate the most cash for shareholders" or, increasingly, "what will keep us out of trouble." "They're governed by social media," Taylor said. "They're governed by who was last yelling at them." A few years ago, companies were worried about the progressive backlash. Now they're worried about the conservative one. To some extent, companies ended up in this spot by talking a big game and launching programs without thinking through what they were actually trying to accomplish. "They're making decisions out of fear, likely, but they know no matter what they do, there's going to be a percentage of the population that is upset with that decision," said Naomi Wheeless, the chief customer officer at Nextech Systems and a board member at Eventbrite. "So moving silently or slowly is the strategy that a lot of them are choosing." The strategy is not a foolproof one. Many activists and government officials are out for blood, and they're seeking to make some high-profile examples of big-name companies in order to put some anxiety in everyone else. Hiding doesn't mean you won't be found. What's more, the political winds can change, and if they do, companies may be faced with explaining their choices to a new set of constituents. Maybe next time they'll think about what they actually want to accomplish, business-wise, instead of just paying lip service to whoever's maddest at them on Twitter.

Title: Tesla, Intel and the fecklessness of corporate boards

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Sitting on the board of a large American company is at once the plummest and most thankless work in business. Plum because, when everything is going right, you pocket $300,000 a year in cash and stock for showing up to a well-catered meeting every month and a half. Thankless because you seldom get credit for things going right but take the blame when they go awry. And awry they go with disturbing regularity. Consider two recent events. On December 2nd directors of Intel sacked its hapless chief executive, Pat Gelsinger. He had torched $150bn in shareholder value over his three-and-a-half-year tenure at the chipmaker, even as the fortunes of virtually all other chip firms were boosted by white-hot demand for computing power amid the artificial-intelligence (AI) revolution. Good riddance, then. But what took the board so long? The same day, a judge in Delaware reaffirmed her ruling from January to annul the eye-watering $56bn compensation package awarded in 2018 to Elon Musk by the board of Tesla, his electric-car company. The decision is controversial. Tesla’s shareholders have minted it lately thanks to the soaring price of the company’s stock. In June 75% of them voted to bless the mega-paycheque (and move the company’s incorporation from Delaware to management-friendlier Texas). Tesla called the latest ruling “wrong" and will be filing an appeal. Still, the imbroglio is a reminder that Tesla’s notionally independent directors who signed off on Mr Musk’s windfall were, in a judge’s opinion, anything but. Intel and Tesla represent two ways in which boards fail in their duty to represent investors and hold management to account. The case of Tesla shows how directors at the mercy of a domineering figure—be it a controlling shareholder, an imperial CEO or, like Mr Musk, both—have a powerful incentive to humour that person’s whims even if it might mean ignoring their fiduciary obligations. Equally, as possibly happened at Intel, thoroughly independent directors may lack enough of an incentive to care. Either way, the result looks like feckless passivity. Certain features of American capitalism are making both problems worse. For a start, more companies are going public with ownership structures in which some shares are more equal than others. Jay Ritter of the University of Florida keeps a tally of businesses that opt for such dual-class shares. When Google famously did so 20 years ago, they were a rarity. In the 2000s they accounted for fewer than one in ten initial public offerings on American exchanges. In the past five years they made up more than a quarter—and nearly half of tech IPOs, from Airbnb to Zoom. Dual-class arrangements appeal to founders, who are happy to take money from public markets but not to give up control. Investors used to be suspicious. After Snap, a social-media firm, sold stock with no voting rights in 2017, some of them persuaded S&P Dow Jones, a compiler of indices, to bar new arrivals with multiple share classes from the blue-chip S&P 500 and its sisters. Many have since had a change of heart, no doubt impressed by the trillion-dollar market values of dual-class darlings like Alphabet, Berkshire Hathaway and Meta. So has S&P Dow Jones, which in 2023 rowed back its ban. In January Mr Musk mused about adopting the structure at Tesla, apparently out of fear that his mere 13% stake makes him vulnerable to be “voted out by some random shareholder-advisory firm". Investors may be right to conclude that a heroic entrepreneur alone can lead a company to greatness. But they should have no illusions about the resulting emasculation of their representatives in the boardroom. This is easier to swallow when returns are healthy than when they are not. Just ask the shareholders of Snap, which is worth a third less today than at its IPO. The rise of emasculated directors is coinciding with that of absentee ones. Most are physically present at board meetings but, like at Intel, too many appear disengaged. In the latest annual survey by PwC, a consultancy, only 30% of executives rated their board’s performance as good or excellent. A fifth thought it poor. Most telling of all, 84% of executives did not think that directors overstepped the boundaries between themselves and management. Often this is precisely what a vigilant board ought to do. One reason for directors’ disengagement may be overcommitment. This was brutally exposed by covid-19, when boards often convened weekly rather than every seven weeks or so. A subsequent backlash against “overboarding" forced many directors to split their time between fewer companies. The typical busy S&P 500 director now sits on two boards, manageable in non-pandemic times. But this has been offset by the rising number of hours they spend on board duties as the world gets more complicated. Directors’ rutCompanies are also finding it harder to recruit heavy-hitters who won’t nod off. A headhunter recalls that chief executives, a mostly white and male bunch, were out of favour amid the push for greater diversity a few years ago. “Now that is the only thing companies want." With the share of active or former chief executives on S&P 500 boards in decline over the past few years, many won’t get it. There is no recipe for a perfect board. But some ingredients may make them better. Lucian Bebchuk of Harvard Law School proposes “enhanced-independence" directors, whose dismissal by an imperious boss can be vetoed by minority shareholders. A version of this exists in Britain and Israel. And whereas a board’s size or average age seems not to affect investor returns, S&P 500 firms with a wider age range tend to do better. Expedia’s eldest director, Barry Diller, a media baron, is 55 years older than the youngest, Alex Wang, an AI billionaire. Perhaps intergenerational tiffs keep everyone else on boards alert.

Title: Rocket Lab Delivers Third Pioneer Spacecraft for Varda Space Industries
URL: https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Rocket_Lab_Delivers_Third_Pioneer_Spacecraft_for_Varda_Space_Industries_999.html

The newly delivered spacecraft, designated W-3, will be instrumental in Varda's next orbital manufacturing and hypersonic reentry mission. Earlier this month, W-2 was launched and is currently operational in orbit, carrying payloads from the Air Force Research Laboratory and NASA's Ames Research Center. W-2's mission is focused on expanding Varda's pharmaceutical processing capabilities in microgravity before reentering and landing in South Australia. Built upon Rocket Lab's Pioneer platform, W-3 integrates a range of advanced, vertically integrated spacecraft components, including propulsion systems, flight software, avionics, reaction wheels, star trackers, separation mechanisms, solar panels, radios, composite structures, and propellant tanks. The spacecraft is designed to provide critical power, communication, propulsion, and attitude control for Varda's 120kg manufacturing capsule, which leverages the unique environment of microgravity to produce materials and products that are challenging or impossible to manufacture on Earth. Upon completion of its in-orbit production phase, Rocket Lab and Varda will execute a series of operations to guide the spacecraft through reentry, landing, and capsule recovery at the Koonibba Test Range in Australia, managed by Southern Launch. "Delivering W-3 while W-2 is actively operating in orbit demonstrates our team's exceptional ability to manage multiple complex missions in parallel. It really highlights the skill of our team and the strength of our integrated spacecraft technologies," said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck. Wendy Shimata, Vice President of Autonomous Systems at Varda Space Industries, added, "By increasing the cadence of manufacture, launch, and reentry, we are building the foundation for a thriving orbital economy. Our goal is to decrease the time between missions until it's commonplace for capsules to bring products made in space back to people on Earth." The W-3 mission is slated for launch no earlier than March from VSFB. Meanwhile, Rocket Lab is finalizing the fourth and final spacecraft for Varda at its Spacecraft Production Complex and Headquarters in Long Beach, California.

Title: Is Ethereum Undervalued? A Close Look at Realized Price and Institutional Activity
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/is-ethereum-undervalued-a-close-look-at-realized-price-and-institutional-activity/
Time Published: 2025-02-13T06:00:55Z

Ethereum price action amid the broader crypto market bearish sentiment over recent weeks hasn’t been any different from the performance recorded in the past months. Over this period, Ethereum’s price has struggled to gain significant upward momentum, remaining in a prolonged consolidation phase. Amid this, a recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor MAC_D has shed light on Ethereum’s current state and factors that may influence its future price trajectory. The analysis notes that Ethereum’s “ultrasound money” narrative—an idea tied to its post-Merge deflationary tokenomics—has faced challenges. Total supply has reached record highs, and the staking ratio has decreased by 1% since November. However, despite these supply-side hurdles, several demand-side factors suggest Ethereum might be positioned for long-term growth. One other key insight from the analysis is that Ethereum appears undervalued based on its realized price. The realized price reflects the average acquisition cost of ETH holdings across all wallets, currently sitting at approximately $2,200. With the current market price around $2,600, the analyst calculates a market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio slightly above 1, indicating that ETH remains undervalued relative to historical norms. This level could act as a strong support base, potentially limiting further downside. Another factor supporting Ethereum’s potential upside is the behavior of long-term holders. The analysis highlights an increasing number of addresses that accumulate Ethereum without selling, akin to Bitcoin’s “permanent holders.” Although some larger investors have sold during recent downturns, their positions have been absorbed by these long-term holders, helping stabilize the market. This trend suggests that Ethereum’s investor base is maturing, with a growing segment committed to holding the asset through market volatility. Furthermore, the analyst points out that selling pressure in the futures market has eased. Data shows a notable reduction in market price trading volume on the sell side since Ethereum’s price near $4,000 in November last year. This decline in selling activity, even as prices fell, signals a relative influx of buying power, which could set the stage for a recovery if market conditions improve. Institutional participation is another encouraging factor. Major players, including BlackRock, Cumberland, and other prominent firms, have reportedly accumulated substantial amounts of ETH during the recent downturn. For example, BlackRock is said to have purchased over 100,000 ETH, valued at more than $270 million. Such significant institutional inflows not only boost demand but also lend credibility to Ethereum’s long-term investment thesis. Despite these positive indicators, the analysis acknowledges lingering challenges. The increase in total supply and the slight dip in the staking ratio could weigh on sentiment, particularly if macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain. Moreover, Ethereum’s price movement may remain constrained in the short term as the broader market digests ongoing economic shifts. However, the combination of undervaluation, strong long-term holder participation, reduced selling pressure, and institutional accumulation paints a more optimistic medium- to long-term outlook. While Ethereum may continue to trade sideways in the near term, the factors outlined in the analysis suggest that it could be well-positioned for growth once broader market conditions stabilize.

Meet Samuel Edyme, Nickname - HIM-buktu. A web3 content writer, journalist, and aspiring trader, Edyme is as versatile as they come. With a knack for words and a nose for trends, he has penned pieces for numerous industry player, including AMBCrypto, Blockchain.News, and Blockchain Reporter, among others. Edyme’s foray into the crypto universe is nothing short of cinematic. His journey began not with a triumphant investment, but with a scam. Yes, a Ponzi scheme that used crypto as payment roped him in. Rather than retreating, he emerged wiser and more determined, channeling his experience into over three years of insightful market analysis. Before becoming the voice of reason in the crypto space, Edyme was the quintessential crypto degen. He aped into anything that promised a quick buck, anything ape-able, learning the ropes the hard way. These hands-on experience through major market events—like the Terra Luna crash, the wave of bankruptcies in crypto firms, the notorious FTX collapse, and even CZ’s arrest—has honed his keen sense of market dynamics. When he isn’t crafting engaging crypto content, you’ll find Edyme backtesting charts, studying both forex and synthetic indices. His dedication to mastering the art of trading is as relentless as his pursuit of the next big story. Away from his screens, he can be found in the gym, airpods in, working out and listening to his favorite artist, NF. Or maybe he’s catching some Z’s or scrolling through Elon Musk’s very own X platform—(oops, another screen activity, my bad…) Well, being an introvert, Edyme thrives in the digital realm, preferring online interaction over offline encounters—(don’t judge, that’s just how he is built). His determination is quite unwavering to be honest, and he embodies the philosophy of continuous improvement, or “kaizen,” striving to be 1% better every day. His mantras, “God knows best” and “Everything is still on track,” reflect his resilient outlook and how he lives his life. In a nutshell, Samuel Edyme was born efficient, driven by ambition, and perhaps a touch fierce. He’s neither artistic nor unrealistic, and certainly not chauvinistic. Think of him as Bruce Willis in a train wreck—unflappable. Edyme is like trading in your car for a jet—bold. He’s the guy who’d ask his boss for a pay cut just to prove a point—(uhhh…). He is like watching your kid take his first steps. Imagine Bill Gates struggling with rent—okay, maybe that’s a stretch, but you get the idea, yeah. Unbelievable? Yes. Inconceivable? Perhaps. Edyme sees himself as a fairly reasonable guy, albeit a bit stubborn. Normal to you is not to him. He is not the one to take the easy road, and why would he? That’s just not the way he roll. He has these favorite lyrics from NF’s “Clouds” that resonate deeply with him: “What you think's probably unfeasible, I've done already a hundredfold.” PS—Edyme is HIM. HIM-buktu. Him-mulation. Him-Kardashian. Himon and Pumba. He even had his DNA tested, and guess what? He’s 100% Him-alayan. Screw it, he ate the opp. Disclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

The NASDAQ-listed company said it would ramp up evaluations for potential AI and high-performance computing (HPC) uses at its Corsicana Facility in Navarro County, Texas, citing increased interest from multiple potential partners. Riot's exploration of AI computing capabilities reflects a growing trend among Bitcoin miners to leverage their substantial power infrastructure and data center expertise for additional revenue opportunities beyond crypto mining. The move comes as mining difficulty on the Bitcoin network has reached a historic high, peaking at 114.7 terahashes when it arrived at block height 883,502 on February 10, data from CoinWarz shows. A "confluence" of on-chain indicators suggests miners are experiencing more "financial strain than before, leading them to find new sources of revenue," Jaehyun Ha, a research anaylst at Presto Research, told Decrypt. Meanwhile, revenue from Bitcoin mining hardware has significantly dropped over the year, to as low as $10.4 a day over an operating margin of 60% for an average ASIC unit like the Antminer S21+ Hydro, according to data from Hashrate Index. Alongside its AI explorations, Riot appointed three new directors with relevant expertise: Hut 8 Mining CEO Jaime Leverton, former Meta senior engineer Doug Mouton, and real estate investment veteran Michael Turner. Moving in to explore AI and high-performance computing is part of Riot's initiatives to "maximize value" for its "entire portfolio of assets," Riot CEO Jason Les said in a statement. Similar strategic shifts by other major crypto mining operators are at play. Leverton, who just joined Riot's board, previously led her company's expansion into HPC by acquiring TeraGo's data center business. Companies such as Hut 8 and Core Scientific are repurposing their infrastructure for AI workloads, leveraging existing power access and data centers. These diversification moves are also aimed at reducing dependence on Bitcoin's price fluctuations while capitalizing on the growing demand for AI computing resources. However, the company cautioned there's no guarantee its assets are suitable for AI/HPC conversion or that partnerships can be negotiated on favorable terms. Still, Bitcoin mining and other public crypto firms are beating the market, with their overall market cap expanding by 14% to bring their valuations to $108 billion, according to JPMorgan. Riot also operates Bitcoin mining facilities in Rockdale, Texas, and Kentucky, along with electrical switchgear engineering operations in Colorado. The company's stock, which trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker RIOT, is up 0.2% on the day to $11.16, Google Finance data shows.

"This launch represents a major inflection point for our global defense and intelligence customer base as BlackSky introduces very high-resolution Gen-3 capabilities to our high-frequency, low-latency monitoring constellation," said Brian O'Toole, BlackSky CEO. "As more Gen-3 satellites complete production, we expect a regular cadence of additional launches over the coming year." Rocket Lab's Electron launch vehicle will deploy the Gen-3 satellite, continuing the long-standing collaboration between the two companies. "Electron is a trusted and reliable constellation builder for companies like BlackSky, allowing them to be in control of how, when, and where to deploy their constellation," said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck. "BlackSky is one of our earliest and longest-standing commercial satellite customers, and it's great to be heading back to the pad with them once again to continue to advance and expand their constellation." The ongoing deployment of Gen-3 satellites will enhance BlackSky's constellation, ensuring greater imaging capacity and operational flexibility. With these upgrades, BlackSky customers will be able to leverage automated tools for detecting, identifying, and classifying various objects of interest, including vehicles, aircraft, and vessels. These capabilities are designed to support a broad range of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations for tactical and strategic applications.

Title: Spain’s Olive Oil Prices Fall Over 50%: Good News for Shoppers, Bad for Farmers
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/4297160/posts

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/12/2025 5:10:13 PM PST by nickcarraway Spain, the world’s largest producer of olive oil, has seen a significant drop in prices, with costs falling by 55 per cent in the past year, according to The Spanish Ministry of Agriculture. While this is welcome news for olive oil consumers, the sharp decline raises concerns for olive oil producers who rely on stable pricing to sustain their businesses. Why are olive oil prices falling in Spain again? The price drop comes after two years of record highs due to extreme droughts that severely impacted harvests. However, a wetter winter and a return to normal temperatures last spring have resulted in higher-than-average olive oil production, according to the International Olive Oil Council (IOC). Spain’s olive oil output is expected to reach 1.4 million tonnes this season, a significant increase from 850,000 tonnes last year. The Spanish Ministry of Agriculture has reported that since September 2024, olive oil producer prices have fallen consistently. As of late January 2025, 100 kilograms of olive oil cost €381.89, marking a 44.9 per cent decrease since the start of the season and a 54.7 per cent drop compared to the same period last year. Olive oil farmers and producers Despite the relief for consumers, the price collapse is putting significant pressure on farmers and producers. Many small and medium-sized producers, particularly in Andalucía, where the majority of Spain’s olive oil is produced, are struggling to cover costs. If prices continue to fall, some farmers may be forced to cut production or leave the industry altogether. Walter Zanre, UK managing director of the renowned Filippo Berio brand, stated: “We were really struggling to source quality olive oil last year. Now that the new season oils have arrived, prices have fallen significantly.” Full reduction of wholesale olive oil prices does not reach supermarket shoppers Although producer prices have dropped dramatically, supermarket prices have not fallen at the same rate, funny that. According to consumer organisation FACUA, while wholesale prices have more than halved, retail prices have only decreased by 24 per cent in the past year. A one-litre bottle of olive oil, which cost €12.88 last year, now averages €9.79 – a €3.09 reduction. Meanwhile, at the production level, the price per litre has dropped by over €4, according to a report by In Spain News. Experts say this is because supermarkets are still selling older stock bought at higher prices. Consumers should expect further price reductions in the coming months as new supplies enter the market – rejoice!

Why are olive oil prices falling in Spain again? The price drop comes after two years of record highs due to extreme droughts that severely impacted harvests. However, a wetter winter and a return to normal temperatures last spring have resulted in higher-than-average olive oil production, according to the International Olive Oil Council (IOC). Spain’s olive oil output is expected to reach 1.4 million tonnes this season, a significant increase from 850,000 tonnes last year. The Spanish Ministry of Agriculture has reported that since September 2024, olive oil producer prices have fallen consistently. As of late January 2025, 100 kilograms of olive oil cost €381.89, marking a 44.9 per cent decrease since the start of the season and a 54.7 per cent drop compared to the same period last year. Olive oil farmers and producers Despite the relief for consumers, the price collapse is putting significant pressure on farmers and producers. Many small and medium-sized producers, particularly in Andalucía, where the majority of Spain’s olive oil is produced, are struggling to cover costs. If prices continue to fall, some farmers may be forced to cut production or leave the industry altogether. Walter Zanre, UK managing director of the renowned Filippo Berio brand, stated: “We were really struggling to source quality olive oil last year. Now that the new season oils have arrived, prices have fallen significantly.” Full reduction of wholesale olive oil prices does not reach supermarket shoppers Although producer prices have dropped dramatically, supermarket prices have not fallen at the same rate, funny that. According to consumer organisation FACUA, while wholesale prices have more than halved, retail prices have only decreased by 24 per cent in the past year. A one-litre bottle of olive oil, which cost €12.88 last year, now averages €9.79 – a €3.09 reduction. Meanwhile, at the production level, the price per litre has dropped by over €4, according to a report by In Spain News. Experts say this is because supermarkets are still selling older stock bought at higher prices. Consumers should expect further price reductions in the coming months as new supplies enter the market – rejoice! While the current trend suggests more affordable olive oil in the near future, the industry remains vulnerable to climate conditions and global market fluctuations. The IOC predicts that better harvests across Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Tunisia will help stabilise supply, but producers warn that prolonged low prices could threaten the long-term sustainability of the industry.

Many small and medium-sized producers, particularly in Andalucía, where the majority of Spain’s olive oil is produced, are struggling to cover costs. If prices continue to fall, some farmers may be forced to cut production or leave the industry altogether. Walter Zanre, UK managing director of the renowned Filippo Berio brand, stated: “We were really struggling to source quality olive oil last year. Now that the new season oils have arrived, prices have fallen significantly.” Full reduction of wholesale olive oil prices does not reach supermarket shoppers Although producer prices have dropped dramatically, supermarket prices have not fallen at the same rate, funny that. According to consumer organisation FACUA, while wholesale prices have more than halved, retail prices have only decreased by 24 per cent in the past year. A one-litre bottle of olive oil, which cost €12.88 last year, now averages €9.79 – a €3.09 reduction. Meanwhile, at the production level, the price per litre has dropped by over €4, according to a report by In Spain News. Experts say this is because supermarkets are still selling older stock bought at higher prices. Consumers should expect further price reductions in the coming months as new supplies enter the market – rejoice! While the current trend suggests more affordable olive oil in the near future, the industry remains vulnerable to climate conditions and global market fluctuations. The IOC predicts that better harvests across Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Tunisia will help stabilise supply, but producers warn that prolonged low prices could threaten the long-term sustainability of the industry.

Meanwhile, at the production level, the price per litre has dropped by over €4, according to a report by In Spain News. Experts say this is because supermarkets are still selling older stock bought at higher prices. Consumers should expect further price reductions in the coming months as new supplies enter the market – rejoice!

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Faces Securities Class Action After Weight Loss Therapy Trial Data Disappoints, Analyst Questions Trial’s Design – Hagens Berman

February 12, 2025 19:19 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

The oldest and most basic form of a flat screen television is the LCD, or Liquid Crystal Display. A layer of liquid crystals is sandwiched between two layers of polarizing filters. When an electric signal is applied to those filters (that signal being the source to be displayed) the liquid crystals align in changing patterns to produce the moving and (where needed) color image. The full details on how this many-layered LCD panel performs these tasks are more complex than this brief description can convey without reams of diagrams. Eye-watering descriptions of the entire process are readily available on YouTube. But suffice it to say here that the actual moving and full color image is produced by this LCD panel. But the LCD panel itself doesn't have the ability to illuminate, so some form of backlighting is needed to produce a viewable image. In the earliest LCD TVs that backlighting was produced by cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) positioned behind the LCD imaging panel. But those lowly LCD displays were soon improved by using LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) for the needed backlighting. This improved on some aspects of the overall performance, but the stationary LED backlighting still didn't contribute anything to the party other than the somewhat important chore of making the moving images in the LCD panel visible! Consumers flocked to those early LED TVs for their relative ease of installation compared to the dominant CRT TVs of the day. But there were issues remaining and competition soon drove TV makers to improve the performance of their LED TVs. Two developments, in particular, made their way into the LED TV market: local dimming and quantum dots. The LED backlighting on an LED TV consists of a large number of LEDs uniformly spread out across the backlight panel. But in early LED TVs the illumination of this LED backlighting was fixed at maximum to offer bright, punchy images. Any reduction of that light level, as required by the source, was the job of the LCD imaging panel sitting in front of the unchanging backlight. But there's always at least some light leakage through the LCD panel. The result was compromised contrast and mediocre black levels seen by the viewer. But suppose we divide those backlight LEDs into multiple zones and process each of these zones separately, as needed, to respond instantly to the changing brightness requirements of the source. Yes, the LCD still produces the detailed image, but by adding variable illumination from the now active LED backlighting zones we can significantly improve an LED TV's overall contrast and black level. That, in effect, is local dimming. It's now widely used in LED TVs of any distinction. But not all local dimming implementations are equally effective. The more dimming zones the better, but this will affect the price of the set. Nevertheless, even a modest application of local dimming can dramatically improve the contrast and black levels on an LED TV. Another key advancement in many of today's LED TVs is the use of quantum dots. A quantum dot is a microscopic particle that glows either red or green (depending on its size) when it's hit by blue light. In a conventional LED TV, backlit by white light, the white must first be filtered to extract the red, green, and blue colors needed to generate full-color images. But with a blue backlight, assisted by the red and green light produced by the quantum dots, separate color filtration is unneeded. This offers the added benefit of a deeper, wider, and more accurate range of color. Effectively controlling all of these performance benefits to work together demands sophisticated micro processing. All of today's TVs employ such microprocessors, often with creative and fanciful names. These names might even include the tech catchphrase of the decade: AI! But don't get too excited; no HDTV we know of can yet ascertain the program you planned to watch and switch to it even before you can grab the remote control! Manufacturers have also generated a blizzard of names for what are, essentially, LED TVs. But there's another type of TV design that's genuinely different. It's OLED, or Organic Light Emitting Diodes. The fundamental difference here from an LED TV is that OLEDs are self-illuminating. They don't require a backlight. Since each OLED can shut down completely where needed, OLEDs typically offer black levels and contrast superior to those achievable by any other widely available type of display. That's not to say that the best locally dimmed LED TVs can't come remarkably close. With careful setup they can. I've been living daily with the 85-inch TCL LED TV I reviewed last year and have had few complaints (though the impact of sheer screen size can also overwhelm minor reservations!). But once you've viewed the most challenging, near-black images on a good OLED TV, in a dim or near-darkened room, the experience is hard to forget. The image on an LED TV begins fading when viewed at off-center angles starting at roughly 25-30 degrees. Viewers seated beyond that are unlikely to miss the loss of contrast. Some LED TVs are better at this than others, but none in my experience will fully challenge an OLED's "choose any seat" flexibility. With these advantages, why would anyone choose an LED TV? The answers involve cost, peak brightness, something called burn-in, and range of available offerings. OLED TVs tend to be pricier than high-end LED designs in equivalent screen sizes. LED TVs generally offer higher peak brightness levels, which can be significant if you plan to do most of your viewing in a brightly lit room. And even if not, program sources produced in high dynamic range might also offer more pop on an LED TV than on an OLED. If you watch a lot of such HDR material you might be happier with an LED TV. Leaving a bright, stationary image on an LED TV for hours will affect little more than your electric bill. But on an OLED it might well leave a ghostly trace of that image on the screen. This might fade out over time depending on how bright the image was and how long it was left on the screen. If it's temporary, this is called image retention. But if it's permanent, it's true burn-in. To be fair, burn-in can be avoided with a little extra care. It's never an issue with fully moving images, and today's OLEDs claim to be a little less prone to it than were earlier OLED designs. But even so, the fixed scoreboards common to video games and sports can be potential burn-in risks. And if you live in a busy household with the TV on for hours every day, and other users who might be less careful than you, a good LED-TV might be your best choice. It's also true that a wider selection of LED TVs is available at wider price points than OLED offerings. And not all manufacturers offer OLEDs. In the US, Sony, LG, Panasonic and Samsung do (at least as of this writing) but TCL and Hisense do not. But there's also yet another new television format you may have heard of. It's called Micro LED. In a Micro LED TV the active LEDs that produce the picture are so small that they're the size of a pixel. In other words, a Micro LED TV can produce the image directly. But don't get too excited just yet. Manufacturers working on this type of display can't yet make individual Micro LEDs small enough to function directly as pixels in popular TV sizes. As a result, such TVs are, so far, available only in jumbo sizes, at truly eye-watering prices, and likely only at very specialized dealers or direct from the factory. Samsung can sell you a 114-inch model for around $150,000 (that's not a typo!), though they were out of stock when I checked! For now, if the friendly salesperson at your local Best Buy or Costco claims that the TV you're looking at is a micro LED, it almost certainly is not and that salesperson is likely just confused. If and when they can make the pixel-sized LEDs small enough for popular sizes and at prices comparable to today's TVs, that could upset the whole television landscape. But don't expect to see them anytime soon. The full details on how this many-layered LCD panel performs these tasks are more complex than this brief description can convey without reams of diagrams.

But once you've viewed the most challenging, near-black images on a good OLED TV, in a dim or near-darkened room, the experience is hard to forget. The image on an LED TV begins fading when viewed at off-center angles starting at roughly 25-30 degrees. Viewers seated beyond that are unlikely to miss the loss of contrast. Some LED TVs are better at this than others, but none in my experience will fully challenge an OLED's "choose any seat" flexibility. With these advantages, why would anyone choose an LED TV? The answers involve cost, peak brightness, something called burn-in, and range of available offerings. OLED TVs tend to be pricier than high-end LED designs in equivalent screen sizes. LED TVs generally offer higher peak brightness levels, which can be significant if you plan to do most of your viewing in a brightly lit room. And even if not, program sources produced in high dynamic range might also offer more pop on an LED TV than on an OLED. If you watch a lot of such HDR material you might be happier with an LED TV. Leaving a bright, stationary image on an LED TV for hours will affect little more than your electric bill. But on an OLED it might well leave a ghostly trace of that image on the screen. This might fade out over time depending on how bright the image was and how long it was left on the screen. If it's temporary, this is called image retention. But if it's permanent, it's true burn-in. To be fair, burn-in can be avoided with a little extra care. It's never an issue with fully moving images, and today's OLEDs claim to be a little less prone to it than were earlier OLED designs. But even so, the fixed scoreboards common to video games and sports can be potential burn-in risks. And if you live in a busy household with the TV on for hours every day, and other users who might be less careful than you, a good LED-TV might be your best choice. It's also true that a wider selection of LED TVs is available at wider price points than OLED offerings. And not all manufacturers offer OLEDs. In the US, Sony, LG, Panasonic and Samsung do (at least as of this writing) but TCL and Hisense do not. But there's also yet another new television format you may have heard of. It's called Micro LED. In a Micro LED TV the active LEDs that produce the picture are so small that they're the size of a pixel. In other words, a Micro LED TV can produce the image directly. But don't get too excited just yet. Manufacturers working on this type of display can't yet make individual Micro LEDs small enough to function directly as pixels in popular TV sizes. As a result, such TVs are, so far, available only in jumbo sizes, at truly eye-watering prices, and likely only at very specialized dealers or direct from the factory. Samsung can sell you a 114-inch model for around $150,000 (that's not a typo!), though they were out of stock when I checked! For now, if the friendly salesperson at your local Best Buy or Costco claims that the TV you're looking at is a micro LED, it almost certainly is not and that salesperson is likely just confused. If and when they can make the pixel-sized LEDs small enough for popular sizes and at prices comparable to today's TVs, that could upset the whole television landscape. But don't expect to see them anytime soon. The LED backlighting on an LED TV consists of a large number of LEDs uniformly spread out across the backlight panel. But in early LED TVs the illumination of this LED backlighting was fixed at maximum to offer bright, punchy images. Any reduction of that light level, as required by the source, was the job of the LCD imaging panel sitting in front of the unchanging backlight. But there's always at least some light leakage through the LCD panel. The result was compromised contrast and mediocre black levels seen by the viewer. But suppose we divide those backlight LEDs into multiple zones and process each of these zones separately, as needed, to respond instantly to the changing brightness requirements of the source. Yes, the LCD still produces the detailed image, but by adding variable illumination from the now active LED backlighting zones we can significantly improve an LED TV's overall contrast and black level. That, in effect, is local dimming. It's now widely used in LED TVs of any distinction. But not all local dimming implementations are equally effective. The more dimming zones the better, but this will affect the price of the set. Nevertheless, even a modest application of local dimming can dramatically improve the contrast and black levels on an LED TV. Another key advancement in many of today's LED TVs is the use of quantum dots. A quantum dot is a microscopic particle that glows either red or green (depending on its size) when it's hit by blue light. In a conventional LED TV, backlit by white light, the white must first be filtered to extract the red, green, and blue colors needed to generate full-color images. But with a blue backlight, assisted by the red and green light produced by the quantum dots, separate color filtration is unneeded. This offers the added benefit of a deeper, wider, and more accurate range of color. Effectively controlling all of these performance benefits to work together demands sophisticated micro processing. All of today's TVs employ such microprocessors, often with creative and fanciful names. These names might even include the tech catchphrase of the decade: AI! But don't get too excited; no HDTV we know of can yet ascertain the program you planned to watch and switch to it even before you can grab the remote control! Manufacturers have also generated a blizzard of names for what are, essentially, LED TVs. But there's another type of TV design that's genuinely different. It's OLED, or Organic Light Emitting Diodes. The fundamental difference here from an LED TV is that OLEDs are self-illuminating. They don't require a backlight. Since each OLED can shut down completely where needed, OLEDs typically offer black levels and contrast superior to those achievable by any other widely available type of display.

I've been living daily with the 85-inch TCL LED TV I reviewed last year and have had few complaints (though the impact of sheer screen size can also overwhelm minor reservations!). But once you've viewed the most challenging, near-black images on a good OLED TV, in a dim or near-darkened room, the experience is hard to forget. The image on an LED TV begins fading when viewed at off-center angles starting at roughly 25-30 degrees. Viewers seated beyond that are unlikely to miss the loss of contrast. Some LED TVs are better at this than others, but none in my experience will fully challenge an OLED's "choose any seat" flexibility. With these advantages, why would anyone choose an LED TV? The answers involve cost, peak brightness, something called burn-in, and range of available offerings. OLED TVs tend to be pricier than high-end LED designs in equivalent screen sizes. LED TVs generally offer higher peak brightness levels, which can be significant if you plan to do most of your viewing in a brightly lit room. And even if not, program sources produced in high dynamic range might also offer more pop on an LED TV than on an OLED. If you watch a lot of such HDR material you might be happier with an LED TV. Leaving a bright, stationary image on an LED TV for hours will affect little more than your electric bill. But on an OLED it might well leave a ghostly trace of that image on the screen. This might fade out over time depending on how bright the image was and how long it was left on the screen. If it's temporary, this is called image retention. But if it's permanent, it's true burn-in. To be fair, burn-in can be avoided with a little extra care. It's never an issue with fully moving images, and today's OLEDs claim to be a little less prone to it than were earlier OLED designs. But even so, the fixed scoreboards common to video games and sports can be potential burn-in risks. And if you live in a busy household with the TV on for hours every day, and other users who might be less careful than you, a good LED-TV might be your best choice. It's also true that a wider selection of LED TVs is available at wider price points than OLED offerings. And not all manufacturers offer OLEDs. In the US, Sony, LG, Panasonic and Samsung do (at least as of this writing) but TCL and Hisense do not. But there's also yet another new television format you may have heard of. It's called Micro LED. In a Micro LED TV the active LEDs that produce the picture are so small that they're the size of a pixel. In other words, a Micro LED TV can produce the image directly. But don't get too excited just yet. Manufacturers working on this type of display can't yet make individual Micro LEDs small enough to function directly as pixels in popular TV sizes. As a result, such TVs are, so far, available only in jumbo sizes, at truly eye-watering prices, and likely only at very specialized dealers or direct from the factory. Samsung can sell you a 114-inch model for around $150,000 (that's not a typo!), though they were out of stock when I checked! For now, if the friendly salesperson at your local Best Buy or Costco claims that the TV you're looking at is a micro LED, it almost certainly is not and that salesperson is likely just confused. If and when they can make the pixel-sized LEDs small enough for popular sizes and at prices comparable to today's TVs, that could upset the whole television landscape.

February 12, 2025 18:31 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until April 14, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit. Captioned Cronin v. Merck & Co., Inc., No. 25-cv-01208 (D.N.J.), the Merck class action lawsuit charges Merck and certain of Merck’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-merck-co-inc-class-action-lawsuit-mrk.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Merck operates as a healthcare company worldwide. The Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck’s projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China’s approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck’s optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck’s ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished. The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 “there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei.” On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Then, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%” “primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan.” On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Merck securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Merck class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Merck class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Merck class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit.

Title: Egg prices shot up 15% in January as retailers limit customer purchases
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/egg-prices-bird-flu-inflation-stores-limit-purchases/
Time Published: 2025-02-12T22:43:26Z
Full Content:
Watch CBS News By Megan Cerullo, Kate Gibson Edited By Alain Sherter Updated on: February 13, 2025 / 7:27 AM EST / CBS News Egg prices continue to soar — if shoppers can even find them in grocery stores. In January alone, the cost of eggs around the U.S. jumped more than 15% from a year ago, to roughly $4.95 a dozen. That's five times the overall U.S. inflation rate of 3%, Consumer Price Index data showed on Wednesday. In 2019, consumers could pick up a dozen eggs for around $1.54, but by last year the price had soared to $4.15 — a 170% increase, according to CBS News' price tracker of everyday goods. The spike in egg prices last month underscores the devastating impact of avian flu, which killed more than 40 million egg-laying birds last year. Including ducks and chickens, 148 million birds have been ordered euthanized since the current strain of bird flu, H5N1, began spreading around the U.S. in 2022. If there's any good news, it's that egg prices are at least expected to rise more slowly over the course of the year. The January surge "is likely a one-off," said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco. But that may come as small consolation for the millions of consumers who continue to grapple with higher food costs both at home and in restaurants due to record-high egg prices. The price spike in eggs is largely driven by the bird flu, which continues to hit farms and wipe out flocks. When demand remains steady for a product that isn't easily substituted and supply diminishes, prices tend to rise. "If you don't have a bird you don't have an egg," Sharon Linsenbardt, founder and owner of Barn Buddies Rescue and Sanctuary in Las Vegas, told CBS News reporter Andres Gutierrez. The millions of egg-laying hens killed by avian influenza can't be replaced easily and quickly, added Linsenhardt, who has limited sales to two dozen eggs a family. "High egg prices are due to the avian flu issue, which cuts the supply in the available eggs for sale," Columbia Business School professor Yiming Ma told CBS MoneyWatch. "If you have less supply, that drives up the prices." Egg supplies are likely to remain constrained as long as bird flu outbreaks continue, according to David Anderson, an agricultural economics professor at Texas A&M University. Anderson, noting a cultural shift that may be exacerbating the problem, also said he has noticed that Americans are leaning toward more protein-heavy diets, driving demand for eggs. "We have this nutritional trend, and as people incorporate more protein in their diets, that increases overall egg demand and sets a higher base for demand," he said. "Then when we get this supply shock, low and behold, we get higher prices." Ongoing egg shortages and rising prices recently prompted 24-hour breakfast chain Waffle House to add a 50 cent surcharge per egg, while some major grocery chains are imposing limits on how many eggs shoppers can buy at a time. Walmart is curtailing purchases of 60-count cartons to two per purchase "to ensure more customers can have access to eggs," a spokesperson for the retailer said. "Although supply is very tight, we're working with suppliers to try and help meet customer demand, while striving to keep prices as low as possible," the spokesperson added. At Sam's Club, a division of Walmart, the warehouse club is limiting the number of egg purchases to two per item at its nearly 600 stores across the U.S. As of Wednesday, most of Target's nearly 2,000 U.S. stores had eggs in stock, and the retailer only has purchase limits in place in its Hawaii stores, according to a spokesperson for the retailer. "We'll continue to monitor and adjust as needed," they added. Kroger, which operates about 2,700 U.S. grocery stores, hasn't imposed a company-wide cap on egg purchases, though some stores are limiting customers to buying two dozen per visit. Giant Eagle said it was selling conventional shelled eggs "at or below our cost across all our supermarkets" to limit the impact of rising egg prices on its customers. The regional grocery, which operates more than 470 stores in Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, is encouraging shoppers to limit their purchase to a maximum of three egg cartons per visit. Amazon-owned Whole Foods and Costco did not respond to requests for comment. Egg prices are expected to rise a total of 20% in 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the rising costs, consumer demand remains firm and could even increase as Easter approaches, offering little hope for respite on prices. Two things have to happen for prices to ease, according to experts. The U.S. must contain the bird flu, and older chickens that are past their productive primes, as well as diseased chickens, have to be replaced. Exactly how long all of this will take is uncertain. "it's not clear that we've fully controlled the spread of bird flu. That's the first step, and it'll be a few months after that before you can breed and replace the laying population," Bryan Spillane, Bank of America senior food and beverage analyst, told CBS MoneyWatch. He expects it will be at least another three to six months before prices moderate. If restaurants continue to implement surcharges for eggs, that could eventually put a damper on demand. In the near-term, Anderson expects eggs to continue hitting consumers' wallets. "I wouldn't be surprised to see prices continue to go up, because we continue to have outbreaks," he said. Cost-conscious consumers can comparison shop among grocery stores, noted NerdWallet spokesperson Sara Rathner, but be aware that if price differences aren't substantial, you could eat up any cost savings on gas. Other ways to save on eggs include using store circulars, or buying them with a cash-back credit card. "Then you're combining multiple ways to reduce your bill," she said.

February 12, 2025 17:00 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The following statement is being issued by Levi & Korsinsky, LLP: To: All persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) between February 3, 2022 to February 3, 2025, both dates inclusive. You are hereby notified that the class action lawsuit Michael Cronin v. Merck & Co., Inc., et al. (Case No. 2:25-cv-01208) has been commenced in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. To get more information go to: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/merck-co-inc-lawsuit-submission-form or contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. either via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. There is no cost or obligation to you. According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day. If you suffered a loss in MRK securities, you have until April 14, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Title: While Tariffs Take Center Stage, Inflation Approaches Fed Target
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/02/12/while-tariffs-take-center-stage-inflation-approaches-fed-target/
Time Published: 2025-02-12T20:36:30Z
Full Content:
U.S. equity markets have fallen for two weeks in a row due, no doubt, to the uncertainty introduced first by the Chinese DeepSeek company which announced an uber-cheap AI model that initially sent Nvidia and other AI stocks reeling (NVDA down more than -18% in January’s last week; recovering about half of that in the market week ended February 7th).6 10 Microsoft (MSFT) shares also tumbled on the DeepSeek news,7 11 while Meta hit an all-time high.2 12 Magnificent 7 As noted in the next table, the tech heavy Nasdaq led the way down over those two weeks, but not all the decline can be blamed on DeepSeek and AI. Equity Markets Part of the markets’ nervousness stems from the uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s tariff program and the uncertainty surrounding his policies in general.3 4 Markets abhor uncertainty. Initially, markets interpreted Trumps 20% tariff threats on Mexico and Canada as bargaining chips that were unlikely to be implemented.5 6 But when the tariff threats became reality, markets became unnerved.5 They calmed a bit when those tariffs were put on a 30-day hold (bargaining chips – Trump style),8 9 but we are likely to see more market nerves as the end of the 30-day period of reprieve approaches. Then on Monday (February 10th), Trump put 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.3 13 While, in the long run, that may cause more domestic production, in the short run, the cost of construction will be rising.3 On Friday, Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) for January came in at +143K, lower than the consensus estimate of +175K.15 16 As we’ve noted in past blogs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) adds a number to the NFP every month because their survey includes large and medium size businesses, but no small businesses. That number is supposed to account for small business growth. This is known as the Birth/Death Model, and in January’s data release, that add was +126K.22 23 On net, then, the actual survey count was only +17K (126K+17K = +143K). Also of note, the U3 Unemployment Rate fell from 4.1% in December to 4.0%.15 16 Yet despite this seeming strength, it appears that the labor market is actually softening. Such evidence includes: Average Weekly Hours All the above data leads us to conclude that the “strong” labor market is now showing weakening trends that are likely to have a negative impact in the near-term. In addition, the latest University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index retreated to a score of 67.8 in February, down from January’s 71.1 score. Of note, the Current Conditions sub-index got knocked for a loop, falling to a score of 68.7 in February from January’s 74.0, indicating a rising level of stress in the current environment. Our past blogs have pointed out the lags in the data, especially rents, used by the BLS to calculate CPI inflation. In addition, the media is fixated on the year/year inflation rate. As of December, the official rate of CPI inflation was 2.9% (that’s a year/year calculation).17 25 26 But for the latest six months, it has fallen to +0.9% (Annual Rate) and to +0.4% for the last three months.25 26 Clearly, with falling rents, the monthly rate of inflation is now running well below the Fed’s 2% target. CPI for January is due on Wednesday, February 12th.20 That should provide further information for markets to digest. One note of caution: January often contains automatic annual price increases, especially on the services side (like insurance premiums).25 26 So, the downtrend in the CPI could be at risk. Nevertheless, we still think that the Fed will be lowering the Fed Funds Rate at a much faster pace than currently priced in the market.18 19 And that means that long-term rates, as represented by the 10-Year Treasury Yield, will be falling faster than markets now anticipate. Currently, odds of a rate cut in March are down to 8.5% (was 16% before the NFP number), and those odds were trimmed from 65% to 57% for the Fed’s June meetings.18 Our view is that those odds are way too low, especially in this year’s second half. 10 Year Treasury Yield The DeepSeek AI model (AI may be much cheaper than assumed) injected more uncertainty into the equity markets, causing prices in certain segments of the tech sector to pause (and/or slightly retreat) over the two weeks ending on February 7th.1 7 10 Of course, the tariff issue, especially regarding Mexico and Canada, also played (and continues to play) a significant role in market sentiment.4 5 After all, markets abhor a high and rising level of uncertainty. Add to that the Monday (February 10th) announcement of 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.4 20 The other big data announcement was the Payroll Survey (NFP) which reported +143K (lower than the market consensus of +175K).14 17 23 On Tuesday, February 4th, the JOLTS (Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey) reported a marked decline in hiring rates.5 21 Overall, the data showed a reduction in the workweek and aggregate hours worked in January to the lowest level in nearly five years. In our view, the characterization of the labor market as “strong” by Fed Chair Powell, and by the media, is likely a significant overstatement. The inflation news continues to be hopeful. While the Fed and the media are fixated on the year/year rate of CPI inflation (2.9%), the annualized rate over the past six months has fallen below +1% and to just +0.4% over the past three months.27 26 On a year/year basis (the one the Fed prefers), if recent inflation continues, the rate of CPI inflation is highly likely to be at or below the Fed’s 2% target by the end of June. In this scenario, interest rates will be falling, and the market odds of rate cuts will be rising.18 19 (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

Title: The Tesla Revolt

The company’s fate will reveal how strong the foundation of Elon Musk’s influence really is. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Updated at 4:52 p.m. on February 12, 2025 Donald Trump may be pleased enough with Elon Musk, but even as the Tesla CEO is exercising his newfound power to essentially undo whole functions of the federal government, he still has to reassure his investors. Lately, Musk has delivered for them in one way: The value of the company’s shares has skyrocketed since Trump was reelected to the presidency of the United States. But Musk had much to answer for on his recent fourth-quarter earnings call—not least that in 2024, Tesla’s car sales had sunk for the first time in a decade. Profits were down sharply too. Usually, when this happens at a car company, the CEO issues a mea culpa, vows to cut costs, and hypes vehicles coming to market soon. Instead, Musk beamed about robotics, artificial intelligence, and Tesla’s path to being “worth more than the next top five companies combined.” This is the vision he has been selling investors for years: Making cars—a volatile, hypercompetitive business with infamously low profit margins—was only the start for Tesla. Its future business will be making fleets of self-driving taxis and humanoid robots trained for thankless manual labor. Whether his vision has any connection to reality is hotly debated by many AI and robotics experts, but most Wall Street analysts put their faith in Musk. And he has, at times, delivered on wildly ambitious goals. Shares jumped again after the call. (Tesla did not respond to a request for comment; a DOGE official did not respond to an email seeking comment.) Musk gets the benefit of the doubt from investors because—despite undelivered promises, half-baked ideas, and forgotten plans—he has made Tesla worth, on paper at least, more than essentially the rest of the auto industry combined. His funders are asked to buy Musk’s picture of the future, and the recent enthusiasm for Tesla stock suggests they believe that his political influence will help him get there. Musk needs that belief to hold. Tesla’s stock price is the largest source of his enormous wealth and, by extension, his influence; if his plans succeed, that stock is also his clearest shot at achieving trillionaire status. Right now, though, Tesla’s primary business is still selling cars that people drive, and Musk himself may be the biggest reason that faith in Tesla could falter. For all of Musk’s ire for the former president, Tesla did very well in the Joe Biden years. The Model Y is the world’s best-selling electric vehicle and its best-selling car, period. The company has comfortably been out of its “money-losing start-up” phase for years. Although the competition among EV makers is heating up, the only individual company close to eating into Tesla’s market share is China’s BYD, which for the first time last year produced more EVs than Tesla did. Yet that competition can’t entirely account for Tesla’s latest, abysmal numbers. Last year, Tesla sales were down nearly 12 percent in the EV stronghold of California. And in Europe, where Musk is helping supercharge far-right politics, Tesla’s sales were down 63 percent last month in France and 59 percent in Germany. This is happening even as the rest of the worldwide electric market is growing fast; nearly every car company that makes EVs saw sales gains in 2024, some of them huge. Musk’s activism does seem to be turning off the affluent or middle-income progressive crowd that was traditionally Tesla’s bread and butter. Look no further than how the company’s new, updated Model Y has been received. Musk’s army of fanboys on X was as effusive as ever, but outside the hard-core Tesla bubble, the SUV was met with a flood of Nazi jokes following Musk’s Sieg heil–ish arm gesture at Trump’s inauguration. This type of reaction goes beyond that one car; the Cybertruck has a unique penchant for being the target of vandalism, and people appear to be making a killing selling anti-Musk bumper stickers to disgusted Tesla owners. In covering the auto industry, I can’t go a week without fielding emails from people asking for advice on the best EV alternatives to Tesla—many from longtime Tesla owners who say they’re ready to move on. In theory, Musk’s rightward turn could help him swap out traditionally liberal buyers for more conservative ones, who usually tend to be more skeptical of EVs. And it’s likely that EVs will become less polarizing along partisan lines over time as electrification becomes more common on new cars. Right now, however, even the deep-red-coded Cybertruck doesn’t seem to be changing many minds about the concept of battery-powered cars. Take a recent report from the EV Politics Project, a nonprofit group that studies the partisan divide over electric cars. Their study indicates that although Musk himself is now viewed much more favorably by Trump voters and Republicans, he’s not leading some seismic shift in how they view EVs. Nor is he obviously trying to get MAGA voters to buy the new Model Y. In fact, those who follow the auto industry closely wonder if Musk is still interested in running a car company at all. On that January earnings call, he offered only a boilerplate response about “more affordable” new Teslas coming soon; the word Cybertruck was not uttered once. He is, however, clearly focused on the company’s “unsupervised” robotaxi service. (Imagine Uber, except with Model Ys and Model 3 sedans, and with no humans behind the wheel.) He claims that Tesla will launch the taxis in Austin in June, the first step toward turning the company into the AI powerhouse that Musk thinks will make it so valuable. Right now, his AI ventures are separate, but he’s started mingling them with his ambitions for Tesla. Ultimately, his thinking—which he’s articulated in earnings and public appearances over a number of years—is that his roving network of autonomous vehicles can use their cameras to capture huge quantities of data, and those data can be used to train AI networks. In the immediate future, Musk wants Tesla robotaxis everywhere, as soon as possible, and sleeping next door to the White House could help advance that part of his vision. Critics have expressed concerns that his newfound influence could also help stymie federal investigations into Tesla, which are probing the crash record of the company’s “Full Self-Driving” technology and its claims about the technology’s safety. And his current political position could help eliminate one of his oldest foes: regulations. Tesla has long clashed with environmental rules (last year, a California judge ordered Tesla to pay $1.5 million over allegations that it mishandled hazardous waste), labor laws (employees at a Tesla plant have said that the company failed to pay overtime, among other alleged violations), and safety ordinances (the company was recently fined for violating California’s workplace-heat-safety rules at one of their plants). But the greatest roadblock to Musk’s vision of robotaxis everywhere is arguably America’s current patchwork of state-by-state rules and regulations for autonomous vehicles, which may allow self-driving cars in some places but not others. No federal standards currently exist, but creating rules favorable to the industry would speed things up—especially if those rules were tailored to especially benefit Tesla. Musk’s approach to Tesla’s future has more than a few problems that the rest of the self-driving-car industry does not face. Tesla relies solely on cameras and AI for its automated-driving systems, rather than lidar and other more advanced sensors used by competitors. Plenty of experts think Tesla’s strategy can never power true autonomous driving. And Tesla is already years behind robotaxi companies operating in many cities right now, most notably Google’s Waymo. Musk’s Tesla faces the rising threat of China’s advancements in AI too: Investors are noticing BYD’s autonomy-focused deal with tech upstart DeepSeek. And they’re noticing where Musk’s attention lies; as he holds court in the Oval Office, Tesla’s stock has begun losing all those postelection gains. The most daunting problem, though, may be the same problem Musk has always had: people. Even if he does succeed in tearing down the regulatory state for the sake of his own companies, who’s to say anyone will buy what they’re selling. Any power Musk has in the future depends on turning millions of people into Tesla customers. If he can’t do that—or at least keep convincing investors that he’ll be able to—he’s just another guy screaming online.

Title: Tech companies laying off staff are still hiring — especially in AI
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-companies-hiring-job-openings-ai-cloud-infrastructure-layoffs-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-12T19:03:29Z
Full Content:
Just because you've read about a tech company doing layoffs doesn't mean the company isn't continuing to hire. The first two months of the year have already seen many tech firms conduct or announce layoffs. While some may be looking to operate more efficiently, many have hundreds or thousands of open job listings. Backfilling the roles of laid-off employees or hiring more staff in divisions deemed a higher priority could build back head count levels in the coming year. In some cases, companies plan to grow their head count in the coming year, and one red-hot area many companies are bolstering hiring is AI, for example, and related divisions such as infrastructure and cloud computing. Here's a look at some tech companies that are still adding staff to their payroll amid layoffs. The workplace management platform is laying off 1,750 employees, or 8.5% of its workforce. CEO Carl Eschenbach told staffers in a memo he published that the company would "continue to hire in key strategic areas and locations" throughout fiscal year 2026. Workday is "prioritizing innovation investments like AI and platform development, and rigorously evaluating the ROI of others across the board," he wrote. Workday has 348 job openings on its website as of this writing. Meta is cutting 5% of its workforce, targeting employees it says are low performers, with plans to backfill those roles later this year. The company is planning to hire "in the priority areas of infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, generative artificial intelligence (AI), as well as regulation and compliance," it said in its Q4 earnings last month. Meta appears to be accelerating hiring for machine learning engineers amid its layoffs, according to an internal memo viewed by BI. Meta has 1,750 job openings on its website as of this writing. Stripe has laid off 300 workers, primarily in product, engineering, and operations roles. The cuts represent roughly 3.5% of the payment platform's workforce. However, the company's chief people officer, Rob McIntosh, said in a memo to staff that Stripe is "not slowing down hiring." Stripe plans to boost its head count to roughly 10,000 employees by the end of 2025, which would be a 17% increase year-over-year, he wrote. Stripe has several hundred job openings on its website as of this writing. Salesforce is reportedly laying off 1,000 people, who will be able to apply for other positions internally, Bloomberg reported this month. The company has not publicly commented on the matter and did not immediately respond to BI's request for comment. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in December that the company plans to hire 2,000 salespeople focused on selling its AI products. Salesforce has 995 job openings on its website as of this writing. Microsoft began performance-based layoffs at the end of January. Separate from the performance-based layoffs, the tech giant also made cuts across organizations including security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming, BI previously reported. Microsoft has 2,128 job openings on its website as of this writing. Layoffs can result in a domino effect in the tech industry — look no further than Mark Zuckerberg's famous "year of efficiency" or the CEOs inspired by Elon Musk's deep cuts when taking over Twitter. If that's also the case this time around, we could see other Big Tech companies carry out their own layoffs. At Amazon, for one, CEO Andy Jassy said last year that he wanted to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Google recently offered voluntary exit packages to US staff in its Platforms and Devices unit. Anat Ashkenazi, the CFO of Google parent company Alphabet, said in October that the company would be looking for "additional opportunities" for cost cuts. Google simultaneously expects "some head count growth in 2025 in key investment areas such as AI and cloud." And while Amazon and Google haven't laid out more explicit plans to ramp up hiring in AI, you can bet they're going to duke it out with their Big Tech peers in the heated AI talent wars. Big Tech firms have also made no secret of their ambitious spending plans when it comes to AI. Recent earnings from Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google indicate their combined capital expenditures are set to exceed $320 billion this year, driven largely by AI investments. Jump to

Title: Ozempic helped people drink less alcohol, study finds

A new study is adding to the growing body of evidence that Ozempic (NVO) and other GLP-1 medications could help people cut back on drinking alcohol. Some patients taking a low dose of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy drugs, reported reducing their consumption of alcohol, according to a new study published Wednesday in the scientific journal JAMA Psychiatry. It was the first randomized, controlled clinical trial of the effects of semaglutide on alcohol consumption. The small clinical trial followed 48 adults with alcohol use disorder who were not seeking treatment over nine weeks. During the study, researchers gave half the group small weekly doses of semaglutide while the other half received a placebo. After two months, the people taking semaglutide drank almost 30% less, on average, on days they consumed alcohol, compared to an average reduction of roughly 2% among study participants taking the placebo. This new study follows observational studies, as well as anecdotal evidence from patients and healthcare providers that suggest GLP-1 treatments can help users curb addictions. Semaglutide belongs to the class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that interacts with a region of the brain – the mesolimbic system – to reduce appetite and trigger satisfaction after eating. However, the evidence is starting to pile up that this medication could help people with other types of cravings. The mesolimbic system overlaps with the brain processes that influence addictive behaviors. This overlap suggests that these medications may “modulate the reward-response pathways associated with substance use,” the authors of a previous study theorized. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know In addition to a number of studies, a Morgan Stanley (MS) survey from last year found that people using GLP-1 drugs — among them Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro (LLY), and Zepbound — reduced their consumption of tobacco. At the moment, Novo Nordisk is the only pharmaceutical company that is currently studying alcohol consumption in a trial that examines semaglutide’s effect on liver damage. David Ricks, the CEO of Zepbound-maker Eli Lilly, said in December that the company plans to test obesity medications as a treatment for alcohol and drug addiction starting this year.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Despite the turmoil in the stock market caused by persistent inflation, shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) rose Wednesday morning as the chipmaker’s earnings report highlighted a positive outlook regarding its delayed annual report and announced an ambitious goal for 2026. The AI hardware company is working to avoid delisting by Nasdaq, with a deadline of February 25 to submit its delayed annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CEO Charles Liang is confident that it will be submitted on time. The company expects to reach $40 billion in revenue by fiscal 2026, while analysts anticipated $30 billion for that period. However, the company lowered its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance, now expecting between $23.5 billion and $25 billion. This marks a decline from its previous forecast of $26 billion to $30 billion, while analysts had projected $24.9 billion. Moreover, the company reported net sales between $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, reflecting a 54% year-over-year growth, although analysts had expected $5.89 billion. Super Micro makes hardware that supports AI applications. Last year, the San-Joes-based company went through many ups and downs. The SMCI stock thrived for much of 2024 and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September 2024 when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following that, its auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned, citing disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. Looking forward to a fresh start in 2025, SMCI stock has risen 37% year-to-date and is currently trading at $41 per share.

Title: How Will Tariffs Impact You? Here’s What To Know About Trump’s Plans

Full Content:
From reciprocal tariffs to a focus on Mexico and Canada, economist forecasts and recent history both indicate that Trump’s trade policies will increase prices for American consumers. Here’s how. Consumers will start feeling the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs soon. Trump this week started the process of implementing “reciprocal tariffs,” a 10% levy is in effect on goods from China, and while his 25% import taxes on Mexico and Canada were delayed until next month, they would also have sweeping economic impacts. Many Americans are left wondering: Who pays the price? Here’s a rundown on the history and impacts of recent tariffs, Trump’s proposals and what to expect when it comes to increased costs. And there will be impacts: Nearly all economists agree tariffs are a tax on consumers. If you’re wondering how to prepare for the financial implications, we’ve got you covered on that, too. Workers assemble washing machines on the production line at a Haier factory in Qingdao in east China's Shandong province. To see the direct impact of tariffs on prices, look no further than washing machines. In 2018, President Donald Trump enacted tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% on imported washing machines. His administration purported that the tariffs would protect American industry—and such a move did add around 1,800 jobs domestically, according to a study in the American Economic Review. But each of those jobs came with an average annual cost to consumers of over $815,000. That’s because the report found that the tariffs raised the price of washing machines and dryers (which were not subject to such a tax, but are usually bundled with washers) by about $86 and $92 per unit, respectively. In total, the tariffs cost consumers just over $1.5 billion annually. And it wasn’t just the foreign producers who upped prices: Domestic manufacturers like Whirlpool and Maytag raised their prices by nearly the same amount once their competitors were charging more, says Felix Tintelnot, associate professor of economics at Duke University and one of the study’s authors. And he said the price of dryers went up alongside washers to likely spread out the additional cost producers were facing. Tintelnot said while tariffs can increase the number of jobs in specific sectors, they won’t affect aggregate employment because the country is already near full employment (unemployment is at 4%). “You can get [a] reallocation of employment towards industries that faced higher imports before, but that’s going to come at the loss of employment in other industries, especially export intensive industries,” he tells Forbes. “We are basically trading off cost to consumers with the benefits for producers in the import competing sectors.” Anti-World Trade Organization protesters during a 1999 demonstration in Seattle. Tariffs have been a trade weapon in the United States’ arsenal since the country’s very beginning. One of Congress’ first acts was to pass the Tariff Act of 1789, which was aimed at protecting domestic industry and raising revenue for the new government. In fact, tariffs actually constituted the majority of the federal government’s revenue until the creation of the income tax in 1913. With more money flowing into the government’s coffers from the income tax, along with the spoils of major industrial expansion in the late 1800s, import duties became less critical. Still, after the stock market crashed in 1929, Congress approved the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised already high tariff rates and angered the country’s trading partners. Trade between Europe and the U.S. fell by two-thirds, worsening the Great Depression. Some experts also say it helped give rise to extremist ideologies in Europe. But after World War II, the world rejected “protectionist” trade policies like tariffs, and 23 countries signed onto the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947, which later became part of the World Trade Organization. And we remained in that era of free trade for decades, amid rising globalization and corporations “offshoring” manufacturing to lower-cost countries like China. U.S. manufacturing employment peaked in 1979 at 19.6 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but by 2019, that had fallen to 12.8 million, a 35% drop. Americans’ anxieties over the loss of such blue-collar jobs had been brewing long before Donald Trump, as the manufacturing sector was particularly hard hit by the 2008 Great Recession. Enter Trump, who tapped into those frustrations with an “America First” pitch. LUIS TATO/AFP via Getty Images Trump used tariffs as a tool in his first administration, targeting washing machines, solar panels and crucially, steel and aluminum, key materials in an already pricey housing market. Former President Joe Biden kept many of Trump’s tariffs in place. But Trump’s tariff threats this time around are more wide-ranging and potentially damaging, economists say. Though the president’s latest threats focused on Canada, Mexico and China, he has previously suggested taxing all goods manufactured abroad at 20%. That would almost certainly raise prices for consumers, especially since manufacturers wouldn’t be able to avoid a tariff by moving operations to a different country. Still, Vietnam is expected to be a major beneficiary of Trump’s China tariffs, and some companies already pivoted to the Southeast Asian country during the previous Trump Administration. Apple, for instance, started moving AirPods manufacturing from China to Vietnam in May 2020. “If previously it was made in China, now it’s going to be made in Vietnam,” Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, told Forbes in November. “That production is not coming back to America.” ANDREJ IVANOV/AFP via Getty Images Trump’s China tariffs are expected to impact a wide variety of consumer goods, from electronics to toys and shoes. Around 80% of toys imported to the U.S. come from China, the Toy Association trade group told Forbes, and around 37% of all footwear imports—totaling $9.5 billion—to the U.S. in 2023 came from China, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. And for millions of price-conscious shoppers who rely on low-cost Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein, the tariffs will also close a little-known loophole that allows merchandise under $800 to enter the U.S. without being taxed. Many electronic devices like iPhones are assembled in China, a core concern for Apple investors as its stock fell 3% the day before the tariffs went into effect. And despite his relationship with President Donald Trump, Elon Musk was the biggest, immediate loser amid the stock market’s tariff reaction early last week, as investors expect the tariffs to impact Tesla’s business and profitability. Though the tariffs on Canada and Mexico were delayed for 30 days, Trump indicated that they would be needed as recently as Sunday, and they have the potential to wreak havoc on a highly integrated North American supply chain. Consumers are already conscious about grocery prices, and the U.S. relies heavily on the two countries for fresh produce. Canada is the largest exporter of meat to the U.S. Natural gas and oil from Canada would be subject to a 10% levy, and oil traders and consumers would pay the price. The price of gas is likely to increase up to 40 cents a gallon within days of tariffs on Canada and Mexico, according to Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy’s head of petroleum analysis. Canada sends about 20% of the oil used by Americans. Tariffs on the two countries would also hit the auto industry hard, as companies like General Motors and Ford rely on Canadian and Mexican companies for parts. Experts estimate the average price of a new car will increase by $3,000, as 22% of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are imported from the two countries, per S&P Global. “The proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico are really quite harmful and would change how American firms can do business,” says Tintelnot. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Separate from tariffs planned for Canadian and Mexican imports, Trump imposed a 25% global tariff on steel and aluminum imports Monday. But the European Union vowed to retaliate, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese sought an exemption for his country. And Trump began the process Thursday of determining reciprocal tariffs, though they won’t take effect immediately. These tariffs are straightforward in theory: The U.S. would place the same levies on imported goods that a country imposes on what they import from the U.S. But it’s actually more complicated than that, because different types of goods are taxed differently. Trump’s memo Thursday directed his administration to conduct a country-by-country review to determine the tariffs. Companies are likely to respond to tariffs in several ways, explains Lori Yue, an associate professor at Columbia Business School. One is building up a supply chain in the U.S., which “doesn’t happen overnight,” or they may lobby the Trump Administration for exceptions. But ultimately, they’re likely to just pass on the cost, which economists expect to tamp down economic growth. “Some of the products, especially the agriculture, gasoline and also the automobile products, this affects people’s daily life,” Yue tells Forbes. “They’re going to feel it stronger than last time.” Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images TOPLINE While Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada are paused for now, investors should be prepared if that relief is only temporary. The tariffs on China still took effect this month, and Trump may be emboldened to continue using the threat of tariffs as an intimidation tactic. Adrian Helfert, CIO of alternative and multi-asset portfolios at Dallas-based Westwood, recommends finding protection in small- and mid-sized businesses that have a more domestic focus, which are still broadly undervalued relative to large caps. He has his eye on U.S. defense stocks like Kratos, a manufacturer of military electronics and drones, anticipating that defense spending will be mostly spared from Trump’s threatened cuts to the federal budget. Another area of the market Helfert is bullish on is regional banks like Texas-based Cullen/Frost Bankers, which will benefit from decreased regulatory costs and more M&A activity and don’t have a large international presence. One of Trump’s tariff goals in addition to stemming drug trafficking is to pressure other American businesses to bring more manufacturing back to the U.S. and trade more with American peers, which will help smaller companies who already have most of their footprints close to home. Nicholas Galluccio, who manages the Teton Westwood Small-Cap Equity Fund, points out that companies comprising the Morningstar small-cap value index already generate 70% of their revenue domestically and are trading at a 20% discount to large caps, while historically they’ve fetched a premium. For investors more inclined to invest in passive index funds, the Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index Fund ETF (VBR) could be an appropriate option for shelter from a potential trade war. WHY IT MATTERS “The stock market cheered Donald Trump’s return to office, rising to new records after he was elected in hopes that his victory would signal a new era of business-friendly deregulation, but it might not be that simple,” says Forbes staff writer Hank Tucker. “Even economic experts who supported him downplayed his threats of tariffs during the campaign, but now that it turns out he was serious about some of those promises, the stock market could suffer. Regardless of how investors feel about his politics, it’s important to be thinking about which businesses will be more sheltered from trade restrictions with China if tensions continue to escalate and prices rise.” MORE Trump Says Looming Oil Tariffs Are Negotiable: ‘Depends On What Their Price Is’ Trump’s tariff proposals would cost middle-class U.S. households $1,700 in increased taxes each year, as projected by the nonpartisan think tank Peterson Institute for International Economics. So how do you prepare? Consumers can try shopping at discount or bulk retailers like Costco or Sam’s Club, and for groceries, consider your local farmer’s market, though increased demand could drive up those prices, too. If you’re a small business owner, it’s probably a good time to refresh research on your supply chain, taking tariffs into account when considering pricing.

Business FILE PHOTO: An empty Lyft pick-up area is shown in Los Angeles, California, U.S., August 20, 2020. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Lyft shares slumped about 9 per cent on Wednesday after the ride-hailing company warned that lower pricing trends from late last year are expected to continue in 2025, as it tries to match prices with larger rival Uber. The ride-hailing platform has been aggressively working on luring customers and drivers onto its platform by keeping prices competitive and launching new features that differentiate it from Uber. However, Lyft said on Tuesday that it saw prices fall in the fourth quarter and the trend has continued so far this year. It added that the company had to drop fares for rides and give away more coupons in the last few weeks of 2024 to keep prices competitive. In contrast, Uber said last week that it expects prices for its affordable private car offering, UberX, to be marginally up this year, as it passes insurance cost hikes on to consumers. "What seems clear though is U.S. rideshare is allocating more incentive dollars towards consumers, funded by lower incentives to drivers — ok 'if' done with balance," Bernstein analysts said in a note. Lyft said it had the flexibility to adjust incentives to balance supply and demand in the marketplace since it had a robust number of drivers on the platform. "We suspect prices will be lower for longer which will test the elasticity of demand for the industry," Needham analysts said. At least thirteen brokerages cut their price targets on the Lyft stock, a day after the company's fourth-quarter results, bringing the median PT to $18, as per data compiled by LSEG. Lyft on Tuesday forecast gross bookings below Wall Street estimates, similar to rival Uber's projection last week. Lyft's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio is 13.4, compared to Uber's 29.4. In 2024, Lyft's shares fell 13.9 per cent, while so far this year it has risen 11.6 per cent. Its market capitalization was set to fall by more than $500 million to roughly $5.4 billion, if losses hold. Uber's shares were about 3 per cent lower on Wednesday.

Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 to start 2025, soaring 50% so far this year. But the software company’s bright earnings prospects won’t be enough to protect investors from short-term pain as its share price eventually returns to more normal levels, some analysts say. The stock, which dipped about 3.5% to close at $112.62 per share on Tuesday, has still surged about 35% since the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings earlier this month. And it’s up a whopping 350% over the last 12 months. That’s taken Palantir’s price-to-earnings ratio to almost 600, and about 200 based on projected 12-month earnings. The overall current PE for the Nasdaq is about 42. “The stock’s not made of teflon,” said Bob Lang, founder and chief options analyst at Explosive Options. Palantir is trading at about 150% of the 200-day moving average, which Lang called an “extraordinary” level that can’t last forever. “Eventually the rally will peter out as investors get exhausted,” Lang said. The company, which builds software for big data analytics companies, earlier this month reported revenue of $828 million for the fourth quarter — a 36% jump year over year. Revenue from the U.S. government grew 45%. Palantir’s projections for sales and profit in 2025 both topped analysts’ estimates. Palantir may trigger a selloff if it opts to sell new shares to take advantage of its current, much higher market valuation, Lang said. The could quickly test the $84-$87 level. However, even at $90 per share, there would still be an uptrend. Lang remains optimistic about the company’s earnings prospects. He said analysts’ estimates of 25% growth in 2026 are far too low as Palantir secures new work, especially from governments. Michael Rechenthin, head of R&D at tastylive, a streaming platform geared toward options traders, shared both Lang’s optimism about Palantir’s potential work for the Trump administration — and his caution about the stock’s immediate prospects. “Revenues and net income have been increasing quarter after quarter — but not by the rate at which is stock is growing,” Rechenthin said. He said he won’t be adding to his position at this level. In August, Palantir and Microsoft (MSFT) announced that they were deepening their partnership to provide secure cloud, AI, and analytics capabilities to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Through the partnership, agencies will have access to Microsoft’s Azure cloud compute and large language models, or LLMs, including OpenAI’s GPT-4, through its Azure OpenAI Service that will be integrated with Palantir’s AI Platforms (AIP). Palantir’s products will be deployed in Microsoft’s Azure cloud for government, including clouds for top secret use. —Britney Nguyen and Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article.

Title: Ukraine's Battlefield Fights Are Messy. Its Political Battles Are Getting Messy, Too.

By Mike Eckel February 12, 2025 The mayor of Ukraine's capital city is feuding with the president. The defense minister is under investigation as part of a bitter fight over control of weapons purchases. Recruiters are struggling to get enough men to the front. Ukrainians are fighting calls to lower the draft age. And last week, two more towns fell to Russian forces, though the losses were more symbolic than tactical. Ukraine is struggling to fight an existential war of defense, trying to hold back the nearly 3-year-old all-out invasion by Russia. Exhausted and battered, the population has mainly continued to rally behind the leadership of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But fractures are appearing in the country's leadership and political class. How wide and deep they may become is an open question. Regardless, they come at an inopportune moment for Kyiv, as momentum builds for a cease-fire with Moscow, with Ukraine's main weapons provider, the United States, eager to end the war and diplomacy heating up ahead of the Munich Security Conference this weekend. "These facts tell you that the political process remains active in Ukraine even during the war," said Orysia Lutsevych, a Ukraine analyst at the London-based think tank Chatham House. "There is much hope that there could indeed be a cease-fire and that political competition will restart. It is almost like returning to normal life, to have elections and to have competition." War: A Continuation Of Politics By Other Means On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces have been on the back foot for months, going as far back as February 2024. Last August, Ukraine tried to change the narrative, staging an audacious cross-border assault on Russia's Kursk region, the biggest invasion of Russia by foreign troops since World War II. Kyiv hoped it would relieve pressure elsewhere along the front line and prove to its Western backers it was still nimble and capable of battlefield ingenuity. The West was definitely surprised, but Russian troops did not redeploy from elsewhere. Across the autumn and into the winter, Ukraine was forced to steadily retreat in multiple locations. Velyka Novosilka, a southern Donbas town along the meandering river valley, fell to the Russians as Ukrainian officials, on January 27, confirmed the withdrawal of the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade. A few days later, Russian forces took control of the last remnants of Kurakhove, pushing Ukrainian troops west toward the city of Zaporizhzhya. Major General Mykhaylo Drapatiy, the new commander of Ukraine's ground forces, was ordered to take direct command of the eastern front, a move many saw as a possible indication of how worried commanders might be about defenses. Capital City Wrangling Back in Kyiv, Mayor Vitali Klitschko, a former heavyweight boxing champion, fired a public broadside on January 29, accusing Zelenskyy's presidential office of political intrigue with its choice of a new military administrator for the city. Military administrators have been put in place across the country since the onset of the invasion as a way to streamline coordination between civilian and military authorities. But the appointment of Tymur Tkachenko a month earlier had "political motives," Klitschko asserted, charging that Tkachenko was "interfering in and blocking of economic activity" in the capital. "I am addressing the president of Ukraine," Klitschko said in a video posted to Telegram. "While you, as the supreme commander-in-chief, are focused on the war and the defense of Ukraine, people around you are tirelessly engaged in political intrigue." Tkachenko punched back. "I am not inclined to organize political shows like people who have been in the city government for decades," he said. "We will solve the problems of the city and help the people of Kyiv." Procurement Problems The Defense Ministry, meanwhile, is embroiled in pitched bureaucratic warfare over how weaponry is procured for the armed forces. The Defense Procurement Agency was established in 2022 as a way to manage the flood of weaponry -- both from abroad and from within the country -- that Ukraine needs to arm its military. Previously, arms procurement had been dogged by corruption and graft. On January 31, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov dismissed the head of the agency, Maria Bezrukova, accusing her of mismanagement. Bezrukova in turn denied the accusation and claimed Umerov's dismissal order was illegal because the agency's supervisory board had extended her contract. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau, an independent law enforcement agency, then jumped into the fray, opening an investigation and saying Umerov may have violated the law by not recognizing her contract extension. The turmoil drew concern from the Group of Seven nations: "Compliance with good governance principles and NATO recommendations is essential to maintaining the trust of the public and international partners," they said in a statement. More Men, More Boys Ukraine's battlefield woes stem in large part from its inability to send enough men to bolster exhausted and depleted units struggling to fend off a bigger, better-armed Russian military. Despite passing legislation last year to overhaul the existing system, officials have still struggled to recruit and train enough men. Highlighting the recruiting difficulties is the scandal surrounding the 155th Separate Mechanized Brigade, a French-trained and -armed unit that was supposed to be a vanguard of a modernized armed force for Ukraine. Instead, the unit saw scores of men deserting; its commander was relieved of duty just before the unit deployed to the Donbas, and investigators are looking closely at what went wrong. Zelenskyy ordered a halt to the creation of similar brigades. U.S. and other Western officials have called for lowering the conscription age from 25 to 18. Zelenskyy has resisted, fearing it would decimate the country's already fragile demographics, making it impossible to increase the population in the future. Elephant In The Room Looming over all this is the prospect of peace talks. The Trump administration has signaled it will use a mix of coercion and inducements to get Kyiv and Moscow to at least sit down and negotiate. Among the issues on the table: whether Ukraine should suspend martial law to allow for new presidential elections, which have been prohibited since the start of the Russian invasion. Zelenskyy won a five-year term in 2019. A poll published February 3 that asked Ukrainians which public figures they trusted the most found that Valeriy Zaluzhniy, the former commander-in-chief, topped the list. Since being appointed ambassador to Britain, Zaluzhniy has kept a low political profile, but many see him as a strong contender if there is an election. He was followed in the ranking by Kyrylo Budanov, the sphinx-like head of Ukraine's military intelligence agency, and Oleksandr Usyk, who last year won the world heavyweight boxing title. In fourth place: Zelenskyy. Experts say Zelenskyy's political advisers are aware Zaluzhniy would be a formidable rival in an election. Since his move to London, most of the gruff former general's public statements have called for national solidarity in the fight against a foreign enemy. There's also the fear that Russia could meddle in any Ukrainian election -- as it has done in the past. Sergei Zhuk, a fellow at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington and a professor at Ball State University in Indiana, told RFE/RL in an interview last month that the Kremlin could use its powerful propaganda machine and pro-Russia elements inside Ukraine to destabilize the country during elections. Also lurking in the background: former President Petro Poroshenko, whom Zelenskyy defeated in 2019. Poroshenko's supporters appear to be laying the groundwork for him to run again, although he is still widely unpopular. "There was always this discussion about mobilization, the level of war-time tax, procurement process at the [Defense Ministry], building defenses around power stations," Lutsevych said. "There is unity where it matters in war: about the enemy, and that enemy is Russia." RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service contributed to this report.

Title: Best VR Porn Games to Play in 2025

VR porn games have taken adult entertainment to the next level, thanks to huge leaps in headset technology and production quality. Gone are the days of static screens, now, you can step inside the action with hyper-realistic 3D visuals, smooth animations, and responsive gameplay that puts you in control. Whether curious or a longtime fan, VR offers a completely new way to experience adult content, making it more immersive and interactive than ever. If you haven’t tried VR porn yet, now’s the perfect time to dive in and see what all the hype is about! To save you the trial and error, we’ve put together the ultimate list of the 10 Best VR porn games on the market. We’ve done deep dives into the top ten, breaking down what makes them stand out, and rounded up the rest as honorable mentions. Expect cutting-edge technology, jaw-dropping realism, immersive storylines, and erotic encounters that push the limits of virtual pleasure. Ooh la la! Is it all fun and games? While VR porn games offer immersive experiences, it’s essential to remember that they also come with potential downsides, particularly in how they can affect players’ socialization, relationships, and worldview. One major concern is social isolation. Because VR can feel incredibly realistic, some users may find themselves spending more time in virtual relationships rather than engaging with real-world connections. Over time, this could lead to difficulty in forming and maintaining personal relationships, as interacting with AI-driven characters is often easier and less demanding than dealing with real people. Another issue is the reinforcement of unrealistic expectations. Many VR adult games allow for complete customization and control, something that simply isn’t possible in real-world relationships. This can create distorted perceptions of intimacy, where players expect perfect responses, unrealistic bodies, or total dominance over interactions, which can lead to dissatisfaction with real-life partners. The Impact on Attitudes Toward Women and Femme-Presenting People Another potential downside of VR porn games is how they reinforce misogynistic attitudes or unrealistic expectations toward women and femme-presenting people. Many of these games prioritize male-centered fantasies, often portraying women as hypersexual, submissive, or endlessly accommodating without emotional needs or boundaries. Over time, frequent exposure to these dynamics can shape unrealistic or harmful views on real-life relationships. It’s possible that players may come to expect one-sided interactions that don’t require mutual respect or effort. Yikes! Additionally, some games promote power imbalances, reinforcing a false sense of intimacy that is inherently based on dominance and control, rather than consent and connection. While fantasy has its place, repeated exposure without critical thinking can blur the line between healthy kinks and problematic beliefs. For those already struggling with social interactions, this can potentially deepen resentment or entitlement, particularly toward women who don’t conform to these scripted, fantasy-based behaviors. Engaging with VR porn games doesn’t automatically lead to misogynistic beliefs, but it’s important to critically examine the content, challenge harmful narratives, and balance virtual experiences with real-world perspectives on intimacy, agency, and respect. But it’s not all bad VR porn games also offer unique social and personal benefits, beyond just entertainment. For some, they provide a safe space to explore fantasies, build confidence, and understand personal desires without pressure.

VR can also enhance long-distance relationships, creating shared intimate experiences despite physical distance. When balanced with real-world interactions, VR porn games can be a fun, engaging, and even confidence-boosting outlet. 1.

Try these: Choosing the right adult VR game depends on what kind of experience you’re looking for. Here are some key factors to consider: VR Compatibility Not all VR games work with every headset. Check if the game supports your specific device (e.g., Oculus, HTC Vive, Valve Index, PSVR). Some games also run in desktop mode if you don’t have VR gear. Level of Interactivity Do you want a passive viewing experience (like 360° videos) or a fully interactive game with AI-driven characters, physics-based interactions, and player choices? Graphics & Animation Quality Some games focus on highly detailed, realistic models, while others go for a stylized or anime-inspired look. Consider what visual style appeals to you. Customization Options Many games allow you to modify characters, outfits, and scenarios. If personalizing the experience is important, look for a game with strong customization features. Multiplayer vs. Solo Experience Some games, like 3DXChat, emphasize social interaction, while others are single-player-focused. Decide if you want a solo experience or a multiplayer world with real-time interactions. Teledildonics Support If you’re interested in haptic feedback devices, check if the game is compatible with interactive toys like Lovense or Kiiroo for a more immersive experience. Storyline & Gameplay Depth Some games offer deep narratives and role-playing elements, while others are more focused on quick, no-strings-attached experiences. Choose based on whether you prefer a story-driven game or a casual encounter. Common questions about this new and exciting erotic technology. Are VR porn games safe to download and play? As with any software, it’s best to download from official websites or trusted platforms to avoid malware. Always check reviews, system requirements, and privacy settings before installing. What do I need to play adult VR games? To play adult VR games, you’ll need a VR-compatible headset (like Oculus Quest, HTC Vive, or Valve Index), a VR-ready PC (for high-end games), and enough storage space for downloads. Some games also offer non-VR modes for standard screens. What are the best VR headsets? The best headset depends on your budget and preferences. High-end options like the Valve Index and HTC Vive Pro offer top-tier visuals and tracking, while more affordable headsets like the Oculus Quest 2 provide wireless freedom and solid performance. Many PC-based games also support Windows Mixed Reality headsets. Can I play VR games without a VR headset? Yes! Some games offer a desktop mode where you can play with standard controls and a monitor. However, you won’t get the same level of immersion as you would in VR. Do VR games require an internet connection? It depends on the game. Single-player experiences usually work offline, while multiplayer games (like 3DXChat) need an active internet connection for real-time interaction with other players. Are VR porn games multiplayer or single-player? Both options exist! Games like 3DXChat offer multiplayer experiences where you can interact with other players, while games like Dominatrix Simulator focus on single-player immersion with AI-driven characters. Can I customize characters and experiences? Many adult VR games offer deep customization, allowing you to adjust character appearances, outfits, and even personalities. Some also let you modify environments and interaction styles. Do VR porn games support teledildonics? Many do, yes! Some games sync with interactive sex toys (check out Lovense or Kiiroo) to provide haptic feedback, making in-game actions feel more realistic. Are there VR porn games with more intellectual or story-driven gameplay? Absolutely! Games like XStoryPlayer and Dominatrix Simulator feature narrative-driven experiences, where your choices affect the outcome. These are great if you prefer an interactive story over casual encounters. How realistic are the animations and physics in adult VR games? It varies by game. Some use advanced physics engines for realistic movements and interactions, while others prioritize a stylized or fantasy aesthetic. Games that support teledildonics also add an extra layer of realism with synchronized haptic feedback. Love them or hate them, VR porn games have revolutionized the way people engage with adult content, offering unparalleled interactivity, and personalization. With advancements in VR headset technology these experiences have evolved far beyond traditional adult media, and who knows where they will take us next! When enjoyed in moderation, VR porn games can be a fun, confidence-boosting outlet, allowing users to safely explore desires, improve social skills in virtual spaces, or even strengthen connections in long-distance relationships. The addition of teledildonics further enhances realism, bridging the gap between fantasy and physical sensation. Of course, as with all media, critical engagement is key. Some VR porn games reinforce harmful stereotypes or unrealistic portrayals of women and relationships, so always remain critical of your consumption. It’s essential to recognize the difference between fantasy and reality, boundaries and consent, and to balance virtual experiences with real-life connections for healthy perspectives on intimacy. Ultimately, VR porn games are a thrilling and ever-evolving frontier in adult entertainment. Whether you’re a casual player or a dedicated enthusiast, they offer a unique way to engage with sexuality, pushing the boundaries of pleasure and personal exploration. As technology continues to evolve, so too will the experiences available, making this an exciting space to watch, and play in, for years to come.

Full Content:
February 11, 2025 22:31 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

February 11, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (NYSE:TIXT), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (NYSE:TIXT) Class Period: February 16, 2023 - August 1, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Company’s AI Data Solutions offerings required the cannibalization of its higher-margin offerings; (2) that Telus International’s declining profitability was tied to the Company’s drive to develop AI capabilities; (3) that Telus International’s shift toward AI put greater pressure on the Company’s margins than previously disclosed; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the TELUS International class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/TIXT Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: November 2, 2022 - December 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 25, 2025 The Complaint alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (2) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (3) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate. For more information on the Novo Nordisk class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) Class Period: September 28, 2023 - December 18, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) demand for Micron's products in consumer markets, especially the Company's NAND products, had significantly deteriorated; (ii) accordingly, Defendants had overstated the extent to which demand for Micron's products had recovered, particularly in consumer markets and for its NAND products, and/or had overstated the sustainability of demand for such products, as well as the normalization of inventory for such products; and (iii) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Micron class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MU ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV) Class Period: November 3, 2022 - September 15, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The Class Action alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made misleading statements and omissions regarding the ability of its contracts to stabilize cash flow. As the alleged truth about ModivCare's business reached the market, the price of ModivCare's stock suffered significant declines, harming investors. For example, on September 16, 2024, before market hours, ModivCare filed a press release on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, titled "ModivCare Provides Financial Update." Therein, the Company revised its 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $185-$195 million to $170-$180 million, "primarily due to NEMT segment pricing accommodations made to strategically retain and expand key customer relationships." On this news, the Company's stock price fell $1.40 or nearly 10%, from $14.12 per share on September 15, 2024, to close at $12.72 per share on September 16, 2024, on unusually high trading volume.

Title: Gold Miners or NVIDIA? You Choose…

Time Published: 2025-02-11T23:00:56Z
Full Content:
By Greg Guenthner Posted February 11, 2025 You have a choice… You can either own Stock A that’s down 10% on the year amid negative headlines. Or you can own Stock B trading at record highs with a 17% return year-to-date. Perhaps it seems like a no-brainer. I prefer to buy strength and sell weakness, so I know I would take Stock B any day. Headlines aside, Stock A’s near-term drawdown puts it at a disadvantage right off the bat. Plus, I find it difficult to pass up new all-time highs. But once we pull back the curtain on our mystery stocks, the choice is far from cut and dry. If you haven’t already guessed, Stock A is Nvidia (NVDA), the market darling that has lost its sparkle. All eyes have been on NVDA for over a year, and it has only intensified (if that’s possible) following the DeepSeek fiasco. To be clear, I’m not bearish on Nvidia. I think it’s the same great company it was three weeks ago. I’m simply looking for opportunities that could provide strength and stability as uncertainty spreads across the market. Opportunities like Stock B: Alamos Gold (AGI). I know we’ve all had our fair share of war stories involving gold mining stocks. But before you start throwing rotten tomatoes, please hear me out… Gold is hitting record highs. And if the shiny yellow rock’s advance measures up to past secular bulls, this rally has legs! Check out the gold chart zoomed out to the mid-1970s. Notice the explosive rallies followed by prolonged trendless markets. After ripping roughly 750% during the 70s, gold went nowhere for my entire youth into early adulthood (almost 25 years). Of course, that changed during the 2000s when gold jumped from $250 bucks to $2,000. Another bout of lifeless action mired precious metal markets until last year. Today, gold is printing record highs. But it’s up a mere 150% off its 2015 low compared to the 650%+ gains of previous bull cycles. Some might attribute gold’s lackluster rally to the real store-of-value asset: Bitcoin. Perhaps. But I view Bitcoin and crypto generally as tech stocks. I’ve never noticed a sustained flight to safety into Bitcoin. Plus, crypto has a strong tendency to trend with the S&P 500 technology sector. My best guess as to why gold hasn’t hit $5k lands somewhere between “no one is paying attention” and “no one wants a dumb yellow rock.” Both work. However, rising gold prices will eventually capture more eyes creating a positive feedback loop as more investors turn to gold — ultimately Making Gold Great Again. Of course, by then it will be too late. Sure, you might capture the last leg or two of the rally, but you’ll also catch the increased volatility. The final stages of commodity bull markets are notoriously violent. Now is the time to consider precious metals, especially mining stocks. Here’s why… During the 2000s bull run, Hecla Mining (HL) gained 2,200% while Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) cruised to a cool 3,300%. These numbers might sound similar to the performance of your favorite tech stock — and they should! Mining stocks become the ultimate speculative growth trade during gold bull markets. And most mining names are trading well below past cycle highs. Here’s gold and the Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ) side by side: GDXJ has yet to break above its 2020 high, let alone its 2011 peak. Today, it’s bebopping around $50–$130 below its all-time high set during the last bull run. Imagine the face-ripping rallies across the mining space if and when GDXJ starts to catch toward gold. They’ll look just like Nvidia’s rally off the 2022 lows. A handful of names are already moving. Iamgold (IAG) has climbed 600% over the past two years and its rally has only accelerated since gold’s breakout last year. However, names such as IAG break the mold. The broader mining space has some serious ground to cover… You don’t need to chase $50M market-cap companies — or $500M market-cap companies for that matter. Plenty of solid businesses operate within the metal and mining space. Alamos Gold, Stock B from earlier, touts a $9B market cap. It’s also been around since 2003, which means it survived a full cycle. I like that! And, of course, it’s posting all-time highs. You could also keep it classy by trading one of the bellwethers, like Agnico Eagles Mines (AEM). It broke out of a multi-decade base last week to a new record high. Plus, it’s mined metals and minerals since 1957 and carries a market cap of $47.5B. If you’re feeling lucky and want to take a swing with a five-letter ticker, you will find plenty of gold miners to choose from. I prefer to sleep at night, so I lean toward the larger and more established companies. But Wesdome Gold Mines (WDOFF) is the exception as it teases fresh two-year highs. Could WDOFF post NVDA-like gains? It might if gold continues to rally. Bottom line: Taking a gold position today is taking a position in near-term strength. It’s buying an asset increasing in value — before the crowd shows up and spoils the fun. Don’t get me wrong, I like trading AI stocks as much as anyone else. I simply prefer holding the strongest assets as the market merry-go-round kicks into high gear.

You’ve probably been on the customer side of the Square Online e-commerce platform many times, whether tapping your card on a Square terminal in a coffee shop or buying items from an online store. Square is just as easy to use on the business side. You can start selling products within minutes of signing up, and the service's many store customization options, handy photo editing app, unlimited storage and bandwidth, social media integrations, and robust video tutorials make it easy to recommend. However, Square Online has one weak spot compared with the competition: Its 24/7 customer support is paywalled behind its most expensive tier. Our Editors' Choice winners for e-commerce, Shopify and Wix Stores, pull slightly ahead with their around-the-clock customer service across all plans. Square has three e-commerce tiers: Free, Plus, and Premium. The Free tier is good if you want to test the e-commerce waters and don't mind the inability to apply your company's brand. Free subscribers get SEO tools, and the ability to sync with Square POS terminals, sell on social media, and accept card payments. However, Free lacks Square’s robust website themes, meaning you're locked to its default aesthetic. Strangely, Free subscribers cannot set item quantity limits, so a single customer can clear your stock. Despite Square’s Free tier being fairly lightweight regarding features, it stands apart from the competition by simply existing. The cheapest tiers for Shopify and Wix start at $29 and $27, respectively, per month. Neither has a free version. Next is the Plus tier, which costs $29 per month. This plan lets you leverage Square's website design tools and themes to give your online shop a unique visual identity. In addition, you can create customer accounts, whip up QR codes for items like menus and pre-orders, or create subscriptions. Helpful analytics and statistics are available when you need a deep dive into sales data. Building upon Plus, the Premium tier costs $79 per month and offers real-time shipping rates. It's also the tier where the walled-off 24/7 customer support kicks in (more on that in a bit). Premium has unlimited storage and monthly data transfers like every other Square tier. Square charges 2.9% and 30 cents per transaction. The Premium tier drops the rate to 2.6% plus 20 cents per transaction. You can sample the Free plan using Square's 14-day trial. However, the trial isn't available with paid plans unless you do a workaround by signing up for Free and then upgrading. The trial requires you to keep a credit card on file. Once you select a tier and create login credentials, Square asks basic questions to determine how your customers receive their orders (shipping via Square, pickup, or in-house delivery). After that, Square presents its dashboard. This dashboard is sleek and easy to navigate. In a nice touch, it has a video tutorial checklist that walks you through the packing, shipping, and customization options. I appreciated that the tutorials were front and center. Plus and Premium members can build their websites using templates. Once you select one, you can customize the website for web and mobile use. You can apply different fonts and colors, add drop shadows to your buttons, and round out the corners of your windows—it all gets pretty granular. The stock template options are attractive, but it's good to know you can tailor them to your brand's specificities. The most important feature of an e-commerce platform is the ability to upload items to your stock. Square Online makes this a breeze. Clicking the Items tab takes you to your backend catalog, where you can add digital and physical items to your shop. Photo Studio by Square is a companion app for iOS devices (it lacks an Android version). It's included with your subscription and is useful for snapping product photos. You can easily photograph an item, remove the background, change the background to a preset image, and even add effects like a drop shadow. Afterward, simply add the product's price and description, and upload the data to the online store. Photo Studio and Square Online sync almost instantly. Although it's not an Adobe Photoshop replacement, the app does the job if you don't need studio-quality images. That said, a cheap lightbox and an iPhone can take you a long way. Square accepts all major credit cards, Square gift cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. The e-commerce platform also accepts Square POS, a system that simplifies importing orders, items, and inventory. In addition, Square Online has an application programming interface (API), so developers can create third-party add-ons outside the Square App Marketplace. If you don't want to do that, the Square App Marketplace contains dozens of apps in 16 categories, including Accounting, Booking & Scheduling, and Loyalty & Rewards. Website uptime is one of the most important aspects of an online store. If your site is down, clients or customers cannot find you or access your products or services. Square strives for 100% guaranteed uptime, but the company acknowledges it's an impossible promise. To mitigate this, Square offers transparency by letting you know when outages occur. Subscribers can sign up for downtime alerts, and Square's hardware lets you accept payments in an offline mode. Square also has a website, isSquareUp.com, that lets you check for outages. If you’re having an issue with your online store, you need help quickly. Square Online has customer support, but you can only access its phone lines from Monday to Friday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. PT, if you have the Free or Plus plans. You can contact Square via email (the company's website says a response may take 24 to 48 hours) or web chat (which leverages a bot to answer questions outside of phone support hours). If you have the Premium tier, you can access 24/7 customer support. It's good that perk exists for those who pony up, but I'd like to see all subscribers receive this benefit. Shopify and Wix Stores have that, after all. With user-friendly features that empower you tailor your online store to your exact specifications, Square Online is an attractive service for any business. It's an especially easy sell if you're already invested in the Square ecosystem. The main drawback is limited customer service hours unless you subscribe to the Premium tier. Thanks to 24/7 customer support with every tier, Shopify and Wix Stores inch past Square to remain our Editors' Choice winners. PCMag is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

Tesla stock’s steep losses in early 2025 have cut tens of billions of dollars away from the net worth of the world’s richest man, the electric vehicle maker’s CEO Elon Musk, whose outspoken role in President Donald Trump’s administration draws questions about what it may mean for Tesla. Musk talks at an October rally for Trump in New York. Shares of Tesla declined 6.3% to $328.50 in Tuesday trading, closing at its lowest share price since Nov. 15. Catalyzing Tuesday’s drop were advancements in autonomous driving from its Chinese EV rival BYD and a skeptical note from Oppenheimer analysts led by Colin Rusch warning Musk’s “political activity risks consumer backlash.” The Oppenheimer note, which referenced “concerning” January sales in China and Europe, comes a day after Stifel analysts led by Stephen Gengaro similarly warned “the negative downturn in consumers' perception of Elon Musk could result in a ‘headwind to sales’ for Tesla,” which inspired a 3% loss in Monday trading for Tesla shares. Tesla stock is now down 18.8%, or more than $76 per share, in February, declining almost 32% from its all-time closing high of $479.86 set Dec. 17. Nobody has been affected more on a gross basis by the Tesla slump than its largest shareholder, Musk, who owns nearly 13% of the company and a further 9% equity award pending legal appeal (Forbes discounts Musk’s 9% bonus by 50% in its valuation to reflect its legal uncertainty). Musk was worth $378.8 billion Tuesday, according to Forbes’ latest calculations – a $42.8 billion decrease from his $421.6 billion net worth at the end of January – though he remains about $130 billion wealthier than the next richest person on the planet, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. $12.5 billion. That’s how much Musk’s fortune declined during Tuesday’s Tesla slump as the 53-year-old registered his lowest end-of-day net worth since Dec. 10. The Oppenheimer analysts wrote they believe “Musk's political activity has fans in certain circles, but that his public life risks alienating consumers and employees as the Trump administration tests the limits of its power.” Musk’s more than $150 billion estimated Tesla stake is the biggest contributor to his net worth, while his stakes in his private multi-billion-dollar companies SpaceX, X and xAI make up a majority of the rest of his fortune. Tesla stock is still up about 30% since Election Day, though the initial rally has lost steam as the company’s fourth-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street consensus forecasts and its car sales in Europe and China declined. After donating nearly $290 million toward Trump and other GOP causes ahead of the 2024 election, Musk has played a critical role in the opening weeks of Trump’s second term, most notably heading the DOGE agency aimed at significantly pulling back the federal government’s footprint. Musk submitted a $97.4 billion bid Monday to buy the nonprofit arm of OpenAI, a competitor to his generative artificial intelligence startup, led by rival Sam Altman. Musk’s offer is “a distraction from TSLA's challenges,” wrote Rusch. Musk and Altman cofounded OpenAI in 2015 before a messy breakup over the company’s mission. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: This corner of the stock market could be an under-the-radar winner of the AI spending boom

Wall Street is assessing the impact of Big Tech's massive capex plans for this year, but there is another corner of the stock market that's set to benefit from big AI spending, Morgan Stanley said. According to Morgan Stanley, the spending race among AI "hyperscalers" is an overlooked tailwind for retail sector stocks like Walmart and Target. "Retail is on the cusp of a technology leap with AI, data, and automation. While retailers may not pursue AI infrastructure investments similar to tech companies, the tech capex boom suggests retailers are on the verge of and should benefit from a technology inflection," equity analyst Simeon Gutman wrote. This year's combined $300 billion of announced AI investing between Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta, might not seem like a development set to directly impact retailers, but Morgan Stanley predicts is is likely to lead to a boost in capex among retailers who can afford it. That's as the spending boom will offer big-box stores investing opportunities to improve in-store experiences, advertising, and automation. Those best equipped to invest will see market shares gain, a trend likely to appear amid coming earnings reports. "The big should keep getting bigger and at a faster pace," the analysts wrote. Capital expenditures among retailers are projected to reach $55 billion, marking an average of around 7% year-on-year growth in 2025. Walmart, Costco, Target, Kroger, and Home Depot account for about 69% of total spend in hard, soft, and food retail. Walmart will lead the cohort in capex spening. Estimated to spend $22 billion this year, Walmart's expenditures are four times larger than what Costco is forecast to spend. Bank of America holds a $110 price target for Walmart stock, expecting improved profitability as well as digital advertising and marketplace growth. One challenge could pose a risk Gutman's thesis — cheaper AI allows smaller retailers to join in on AI growth. The possibility has emerged amid the recent introduction of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI that is supposedly cheaper and as capable as Silicon Valley tech. Its implications have sparked doubt about Big Tech's AI spending, briefly causing a trillion-dollar market wipeout last month. If DeepSeek does discount AI expenditures, under-the-radar retail names aren't the only ones set to win out. This scenario would make software stocks also worth buying. "That said, we do not think this will be the case in the near-term and, for now, retailers best equipped to spend should be able to widen their advantages," Gutman wrote.

A record number of Americans missed work on Monday following the Philadelphia Eagles' win over the Kansas City Chiefs during Super Bowl 59. (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY / AFP) (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images) Are you getting over a *cough cough* cold today? If so, you’re one of the 22.6 million U.S. employees who were planning to miss work the Monday after the Super Bowl, a 40% increase from last year, according to The Harris Poll data from UKG. That number includes folks who planned to call in sick––even if they aren’t actually ill––as well as those who planned to “ghost” their employer by skipping work and not telling them. Some have pre-planned their absence, with 12.9 million taking PTO and 4.8 million swapping shifts with coworkers. Even then, an additional 12.9 million said they would be late to work on Monday. Talk about last-minute play calls. For those who did show up to work, productivity may have been down to start the week. The poll found that about 40% of those who watched the game and went to work would be distracted by media coverage of the game on Monday, up from 28% last year. While the scale of these absences is record-breaking, the phenomenon isn’t new. About 43% of employed Americans believe the Monday after the Super Bowl should be a national holiday. Indiana is even taking steps to enshrine that idea into law: A bill was introduced in the state’s legislature last week that would make the day a state holiday. The number of workers calling out sick on Monday wasn’t the only record broken during the Super Bowl: While the Kansas City Chiefs failed to beat the Philadelphia Eagles to secure a three-peat, the game was the most-watched matchup in Super Bowl history. Fox garnered 126 million viewers across platforms, including its free streaming service Tubi. Happy reading, and hope you all have a lovely week!

Deep Dive: Employee Confidence Starts The Year On A Sour Note Employee confidence on their employer's business outlook has fallen to a February 2024 low, driven by economic fears and a new presidential administration. One month into 2025 and employees are not confident in the business outlook for their employers, according to a new Glassdoor report. Layoffs, economic fears and a new presidential administration are to blame. It’s a new year and employee confidence is once again going down. According to Glassdoor’s employee confidence index, which measures workers’ ratings of their employer’s six-month business outlook (either positive, negative or neutral), only 45.1% of U.S. employees have a positive view on their employer’s future. That’s the lowest percentage since last February, when the index hit its lowest since Glassdoor began tracking it in 2016. The weak sentiment comes on the heels of January’s jobs report that saw 143,000 non-farm jobs get added to the economy, lower than analyst expectations. It’s part of the reason as to why sentiment is low––economic anxieties, which rose in January, and news of layoffs have rattled workers. Those working in government and public administration positions lost the most confidence, according to Glassdoor, falling 2.8 percentage points compared to December. The legality of various Trump Administration policies affecting federal workers, including buyout offers, funding cuts and the effective closure of entire agencies like USAID, have made federal workers uneasy about their future. Full return-to-office plans and funding for state offices has also been put into question. That’s without counting the impact on federal contractors who’ve had their contracts and funding frozen, if not cut completely. Other industries, however, have seen an increase in confidence compared to last year. Insurance saw the biggest gain during a month filled with news of natural disasters and subsequent coverage questions. Aerospace and defense also saw a 5% increase in confidence from last year. Employee confidence levels also tend to differ based on seniority. Mid-level employees continue to feel the most anxious about the future and experienced the largest drop-off in confidence compared to other seniority levels, according to the data. In efforts to reduce costs and flatten out organizations, middle managers are often the first on the chopping block. News from the world of work “Financial loyalty at VC firms has never been weaker,” an endowment leader recently told Forbes. It’s part of a larger movement of venture capital partners leaving blue-chip firms (think Lightspeed, Sequoia and a16z) to start their own funds. Meet venture’s new guard. The U.S. added 143,000 non-farm jobs in January, lower than analysts estimated and the weakest January total since 2016. Unemployment, however, topped expectations, though January did mark the ninth-consecutive month of at least 4% unemployment. These numbers are more of an indicator of the job market President Trump is inheriting, rather than any impact he’s had on it thus far. While at least 65,000 federal workers have accepted the “deferred resignation” offer from the new administration, the deadline was again paused by a federal judge on Monday until the president “responds” to the issues at the heart of the several lawsuits brought on by federal workers unions. Google is the latest major employer to roll back its DEI initiatives. On Wednesday, the company said it would remove all of its diversity hiring targets, before removing cultural observances like Pride Month and Black History Month from Google Calendar. All in all, over a dozen major companies have pared back or removed references to DEI in their 2024 annual reports. Amazon employees are increasingly worried about their career trajectories as the company flattens middle management roles in an effort to cut costs, according to Bloomberg. Those looking to climb the corporate ladder have been told to consider “horizontal development,” in other words, acquiring different skills with no promotion. Are workplace feuds the new trend for increased PR? Billionaires Elon Musk and Sam Altman have been squabbling it out in the media over the funding to President Trump’s Stargate program. While their supposed feud dates back to 2015, when both Altman and Musk were among the cofounders of OpenAI, the public comments picked up again this year. Meanwhile, Super Bowl halftime performer Kendrick Lamar’s feud with Drake not only took center stage on Sunday, but has also won the rapper multiple Grammy Awards.

Title: The Raging Debate: When Will Quantum Arrive?

IBM CEO Arvind Krishna There has been considerable discussion and stock price volatility of late surrounding the expected timing of useful applications and hardware for quantum computing. One month after Google created excitement around its Willow quantum chip, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, started a food fight on Wall Street by predicting that quantum computing won’t be a significant computing paradigm for at least a decade. Quantum stocks dropped over 30%. Subsequently, Bill Gates joined in, saying, “There is the possibility that the [Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang] Not one to wade into a shouting match, IBM (a client of Cambrian-AI Research) has been quietly and steadily advancing quantum computing sciences and use cases, as explained in a series of webinars, covering quantum applications in energy, financial modeling, electronics, and health care. Last year, IBM also published the 4th edition of a dazzling coffee table book on the coming Quantum Decade. IBM probably has hundreds of scientists working on quantum developing hardware, software, and ecosystems to lead in this exotic technology. While IBM and other quantum innovators like Microsoft, Google, AWS, and startups see hundreds of applications in development today, Zuckerberg and Huang are probably looking for big-impact applications. And there aren’t any, at least not yet. The current quantum applications being developed fill specific scientific niches with little industrial and economic impact. They are important niches to the scientists who can now solve previously unsolvable problems, but they may not constitute another multi-billion-dollar market. Those applications will take much faster quantum computers and new algorithms that can exploit the hardware. IBM and its competitors are developing hardware, software tools, and algorithms that could deliver those billion-dollar applications in the next 5-10 years. Specific uses of quantum computing in physics and chemistry are already pushing research forward. Still, these experiments demand faster hardware, error correction, and new algorithms beyond the R&D setting. IBM thinks it can achieve quantum advantage sometime in the next two years - via improved performance and error mitigation techniques and increased collaboration with the HPC community. IBM also announced its plans to reach over 2,000 logical qubits. True error correction should arrive in 2029 with the Starling processor, followed by the Blue Jay processor, with 2,000 logical qubits and over a billion gates in 2033. Quantum is hard; extremely hard. Advances in cryogenics, qubit design, scaling interconnects, algorithm development, run-time tools, and applications will enable useful and perhaps pervasive quantum solutions. The inherent error rate of quantum bits is a thousand times higher than that of digital circuitry. Consequently, scaling quantum processors to thousands of qubits and dealing with the instability of those qubits creates demanding challenges. Useful Quantum Computing requires advances in the hardware and the algorithms But we are getting close to realizing significant advances as these developments take shape. The chart above explains the dynamics at play. We are currently at the beginning of quantum utility, where we can begin to see the benefits of hardware and algorithms as we progress. All quantum industry players including IBM, Amazon, Intel, Google, Microsoft, hardware startups (Alice and Bob, Atos D-Wave, Quantinuum, Rigetti, QuEra and Xanadu among others) are amongst the over 70 global quantum startups working on solving these challenges. Along the way, advances in quantum are supported and complemented by advances in classic HPC computing to support the execution of the circuits by offloading some of the execution onto the CPU and GPU or using those tools to clean the results. In fact, accelerated servers surround quantum processors, always working in tandem with classical computers In IBM’s most recent webinar, we learned how researchers apply quantum to solve Life Sciences and Health Care problems. One of the brightest application spaces for quantum is accelerating the R&D process for pharmaceuticals. The current process takes 10-15 years, billions of dollars, and yet 90% of drug candidates fail. Quantum and AI can potentially speed the process, cost less, and produce superior outcomes, potentially becoming the billion-dollar solution that Jensen and Zuckerburg seek. In drug discovery, quantum computing can speed the development and evaluation of proteins through simulation and applying machine learning. Quantum computers have the potential to simulate complex molecular interactions at an atomic level with unprecedented accuracy, allowing researchers to model drug-protein interactions more realistically, leading to the discovery of novel therapeutic compounds. Quantum algorithms have the potential to search vast chemical databases much faster than classical computers, enabling rapid identification of potential drug candidates that match specific molecular criteria. Quantum computers can also identify optimal molecular structures for specific targets, leading to improved efficacy and reduced toxicity of potential drugs. Quantum computing could speed up the screening of vast libraries of potential drug candidates, allowing researchers to quickly identify promising molecules for further testing. Quantum computing has the potential to model complex protein folding patterns and interactions at a molecular level, helping researchers identify novel drug targets that were previously undetectable. IBM is researching the applicability of quantum computing across the broad spectrum of drug ... [+] development and delivery, Quantum computing holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare and life sciences by addressing key challenges in the field. For example, quantum algorithms can integrate data to uncover critical genes, proteins, and pathways. Quantum walks can identify key proteins in cancer signaling pathways, aiding in the development of targeted therapies. Additionally, quantum methods speed the discovery of higher-order gene interactions, accelerating the understanding of polygenic diseases. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms enhance predictions of protein and RNA structures, which are crucial for designing biologics and mRNA therapies. Quantum techniques also improve ligand-based virtual screening and simulate drug-target interactions with unprecedented accuracy, enabling better lead optimization. In clinical trials, quantum algorithms can optimize trial designs, site selection, and cohort identification, reducing costs and improving outcomes. The webinar showcased several collaborative success stories where IBM has partnered with industry leaders to demonstrate the potentially transformative power of quantum computing. A few examples: Client use cases To accelerate industry adoption further, IBM has launched the Quantum Accelerator program, which helps enterprises identify business problems suitable for quantum solutions, prototype quantum applications iteratively, and leverage IBM’s ecosystem of over 250 members and 39 innovation centers. This program is designed to support the enterprise during all their journey of quantum adoption. If you ask IBM, they will tell you it already has, albeit in small doses, while the potential wave of quantum applications will begin in earnest around 2030. Whether that is early or late depends on your expectations, and Jensen and Zuckerberg are famously impatient guys. We believe that quantum computing is poised to transform healthcare and life sciences by addressing computational bottlenecks and enabling groundbreaking innovations. From understanding disease mechanisms to optimizing drug discovery pipelines, IBM quantum’s advancements promise to unlock unprecedented opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry, reducing R&D costs, accelerating timelines, and improving patient outcomes.

Title: How Tariffs Make CFOs’ Jobs More Complex

There’s been a huge amount of change in the last month, and from an economic standpoint, it seems to be hitting consumers slowly, but surely. Job growth is stuck, prices don’t seem to be going anywhere, and many feel they are financially worse off than a year ago. January’s jobs data from the Labor Department, released last week, significantly missed growth projections and signified the weakest start to a year in terms of new jobs since 2016. Economists were expecting 170,000 new jobs, but the report showed the addition of just 143,000. And the expectation of job losses is growing. In the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, released this week, 14.2% of people feel a probability of losing their jobs in the next 12 months, up 2.3% from December. About a third of consumers said their household financial situation is worse off than a year ago, the Survey of Consumer Expectations shows. And while this is down slightly month-over-month, only about 19% say they are doing better than a year ago—a 3% decrease from December. Over a fifth aren’t optimistic about the economy and say they will be doing worse a year from now. January’s Consumer Confidence Index, reported two weeks ago, showed a 5.4-point decline from December. The data shows some optimism. Labor Department data showed record-high average hourly wages of $35.87, as well as an unemployment rate of 4%, down from 4.1% in December. And 36.6% feel their household finances will be better a year from now, according to the Survey of Consumer Expectations. However, there’s lots of room for improvement. Two-thirds of Americans feel that President Donald Trump administration’s policy focus so far isn’t doing enough to lower prices, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll last week. The next round of consumer price index numbers come out this week, which will show just how much prices are changing—though the consumer expectations survey shows that Americans anticipate price increases for food, gas, rent and medical care. CFOs are increasingly having issues with making projections since so many companies rely on imports, and so many different tariff threats are being quickly proposed, rescinded and taking effect. I talked to Bob Stark, global head of enablement of cash management software platform Kyriba, about how CFOs can plan in today’s circumstances. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Workers in Camden, N.J. use a crane to load a 60,000 pound coil of steel onto a railroad car. President Donald Trump signed another round of tariffs this week: 25% on all steel and aluminum imports. “This is a big deal, the beginning of making America rich again,” Trump said as he signed the tariff orders in the Oval Office, CBS News reported. This is a familiar policy to Trump, who assessed tariffs on steel and aluminum in his first term to bolster domestic industry. Those tariffs—25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports—had several exemptions, and ended up bringing the biggest benefit to steel companies, according to a 2018 analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Allies from the EU and Australia spoke out about the planned tariffs, which are reported to go into effect next month, saying that they will harm U.S. consumers and long-established partnerships. The U.S. imports about a quarter of all of the steel it uses, and about half of the aluminum, Reuters reports. Most of the steel the U.S. imports comes from Canada, Brazil and Mexico, while the lion’s share of aluminum imports come from Canada. Several analysts have said these new tariffs will have limited benefit to the U.S.—likely just for the steel companies—and will not likely create jobs. They are also likely to raise prices for most things made from metal. Even the United Steelworkers International Union feels the tariff proposal goes too far, and wrote the U.S. needs to take a more measured approach, distinguishing trusted trade partners. The move caused significant shifts in the stock market, boosting prices of domestic metals companies, including Alcoa and U.S. Steel. It also boosted gold prices to a record high of $2,938 per troy ounce, as investors search for stability. This isn’t the only move on tariffs in the last week. Trump announced during a Friday meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba that he would announce reciprocal tariffs this week—tariffs equal to what other countries impose on U.S. goods. There’s no word yet on how those might work. Russell Vought at a confirmation hearing in January in front of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Last Thursday, the Senate confirmed Russell Vought as the head of the Office of Management and Budget with a vote along party lines. Vought, founder of the prominent right-wing Center for Renewing America and key adviser to the Heritage Foundation’s controversial Project 2025, was considered one of Trump’s more controversial nominees because of his viewpoint of expansive executive branch control on spending. One of his first big moves is essentially halting all work of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, taking its website offline and telling workers not come in and stop work activities. The CFPB was created in 2011 following the Great Recession and financial crisis. It’s an agency that protects consumers from unfair banking practices, but it also has deep-pocketed enemies. Elon Musk, who has been working with his Department of Government Efficiency task force to mercilessly cut perceived wasteful spending, has railed against CFPB because “there are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.” He said this in November, shortly after the agency announced more oversight of big tech companies and others offering digital funds transfers and payment wallet apps. Meta founder and CEO and billionaire Marc Andreessen also have spoken out against the agency, which has threatened action against tech companies’ use of financial data. Rendering of Meta's Sucre data center in Louisiana. AI evangelists say the technology can do a lot for companies, but to continue to grow—both revenues for companies and capabilities for users—some infrastructure investments are needed. Big companies are announcing bigger AI data center projects, with bigger budgets and footprints. Forbes’ Christopher Helman runs down many of these plans, which include not only huge facilities like Meta’s $10 billion planned Sucré data center in Louisiana—covering 4 million square feet of floor space on 2,250 acres—but enough infrastructure to power it all—$3.2 billion worth for Meta, coming from twin high-efficiency natural gas turbines. In all, Meta plans to spend $60 to $65 billion on these data centers in the next year. Meta’s not alone in these investments. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, announced on last week’s earnings call that the next year will see about $75 billion in capital expenditures for technical infrastructure. CFO Anat Ashkenazi said that in the last quarter Google hit capacity issues with its cloud and services business, which constrained its growth. Microsoft is planning to invest $80 billion in data centers. And through a partnership announced from the White House between SoftBank, Oracle and OpenAI called “Stargate,” SoftBank will invest $500 billion in U.S. data centers during the next four years. Kyriba Global Head of Enablement Bob Stark and the Port of Los Angeles. Economic predictions were challenging for CFOs before Trump’s second presidency began, but announcements of potential tariffs on different countries and industries, and along a variety of timelines, add a lot more uncertainty to the future. I talked to Bob Stark, global head of enablement at cash management software platform Kyriba about what CFOs are going through and what they can do to prepare for the short- and long-term future. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. Tariffs were also a feature of President Trump’s first term. How similar is what’s happening right now to then? Stark: You look at what was announced around steel and aluminum, and that feels very similar to what we saw in the previous term. That said, I think the differences—and our clients had the same reaction: the blanket tariffs, the punitive tariffs, if you tariff us, then we’ll tariff you back and it’s sort of back and forth—feel a little bit more significant than what we had experienced previously. It certainly feels like an acceleration. CFOs and finance teams are definitely looking at that as a lot of different potential scenarios that you have to prepare for. It’s not as simple as: This industry is affected [with a] 25% hit, so if you’re a Canadian steel exporter, you have this problem—which is fairly predictable. You can figure what 25% looks like. Same with importers on the U.S. side. [They’re] just trying to understand what does our cost look like? They can map out demand, but it’s the back and forth and the uncertainty around that. It’s difficult to predict exactly when impacts will be felt, which is a big challenge for CFOs. Many of them are looking to provide updates to guidance quarterly. In this quarter, do we have a cashflow impact that we need to control? Do we have a liquidity challenge where we need to make some plans? Do we need to provide different or maybe more expansive hedging of FX [foreign currency exchange] because we recognize that it’s these short and sharp movements that can have a significant impact in the balance sheet and income statement reporting at the end of the quarter. There’s a lot. It’s the uncertainty of what is the actual impact. There’s so many more scenarios you have to play out in different ways that feel different than what we saw several years back when we first saw this idea of tariffs being proposed and implemented. This time around, it feels to me like some of the tariffs that are being threatened and announced are more unexpected. Is that your impression? Absolutely. It feels to a corporate CFO that there’s a daily news cycle that you have to invest more time in following. You have to then build that into your analysis and reporting. If you’re doing something as simple as: What is the impact of cashflow if this blanket tariff goes in. What’s the difference? It’s being delayed by 30 days. What does that mean? There’s a lot of uncertainty and unpredictability around that. That’s the biggest challenge for CFOs. It’s like playing that hand game with your kids. You put one down, then there’s another, and then there’s another, and then there’s another. And then suddenly you think, ‘Wow, where did this go?’ That’s the part that’s really difficult to predict and build into an analysis. When the CEO is calling you because they just saw this on CNBC, and they’re asking the question: What’s the impact on our cash flow? Do we need to change our guidance? You have to juggle not just one or two different possibilities, but [there’s] probably three or four different scenarios you need to model against the same data, and then you have to be in a position to answer with precision on demand. And, ‘I’ll get back to you tomorrow’ is not an acceptable response. It’s ‘I’ll tell you right now, if these tariffs go through, this is what the impact is. If they’re delayed out 30 days, if they’re delayed out six months…’ Those are the scenarios that you have to be able to report to the board with confidence so that everyone's prepared. How do you think a company can make its way through the next four years? There’s three things that CFOs can do, aside from watching all the news and being able to utilize AI to summarize the things that they can’t watch live. Once they’re armed with that insight and understanding of sentiment, they’re in a position to do three things. Number one: FX. Those sharp, short-term movements can be the difference between hitting and missing guidance. Every CFO has to be able to quantify the impact of currency on the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow. If they’re not in a position to do that, then it erodes confidence a little bit. No one wants choppiness. They want certainty, and they want at least three months—ideally more—in advance. If you can eradicate the impact of FX, or mute it significantly, you’re in a better position than many of your peers. Number two: forecasting and planning. Every time there’s impactful news, CFOs need to answer: What would this mean to our cash and liquidity in the future? Finance leaders, they must have precise answers. They have to have them at the ready. They have to be available for multiple scenarios so that hypothetically speaking, they can answer a question like this: Our cash flow decreases by 30% if this tariff actually happens in the next 20 days. You need to be able to answer the question with that level of precision. That CEO and the board, they’re not waiting an hour. They’re probably not waiting five minutes either. They expect data and insights right now. The third part: Getting control over the cash lifecycle. CFOs need to be able to pull multiple levers to maintain control of their cash, especially in response to customers wanting to bring forward orders to get ahead of tariffs. That’s a perfect example of being able to have control, making sure that they can provide the structure, the systems financing to allow changes in the supply chain to occur. Also [to be able to provide control] in response to potential reshoring or recomposition of supply chains. Some of that is a little bit more longer term. That might be later in 2025 or into 2026. We recognize we just can’t compose our supply chain this way. We need to reshore this part of it. We need to eliminate this country out of our supply chain. It just doesn’t work in terms of the cost structure. Whatever that scenario looks like for them, the CFO needs to be able to put in the structure. It’s very tactical. Everything from bank accounts to cash management structures, the ability to sweep the and pool cash and mobilize it wherever it needs to be, to not only invest, but also repatriate cash so you can meet those cashflow objectives of the organization. There’s a lot of complexity there. Nevermind working with supply chains, working with customers to be able to pull the lever of: We’re going to pay you earlier, but it’s going to come at a cost, and as a result, we need to be able to do that. You want to get paid earlier, Mr. and Mrs. Supplier, we’ll do that, but here’s the program to do it. Same thing with accelerating receipt of cash. If you need to accelerate collections, you need a structure with that. It’s not a program that just happens like that. It’s a year in the making to put that structure in with your banks and with your finance and providers. Billionaire Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management disclosed a major stake in ride hailing company Uber on Friday, boosting the company’s stock. $2.3 billion: Value of Pershing’s stake in the company, which is 30.3 million shares 17%+: Increase in Uber’s share price over the last five trading days ‘One of the best managed and highest quality businesses in the world’: What Ackman wrote about Uber on X Billionaire Fernando De Leon has an unusual backstory and advice to build a business that will grow.

Title: CEO testifies on federal agencies as lawmakers clash on Musk

Getty Images As business leaders testified on regulatory challenges and the need to rein in federal agency power, House Democrats criticized Elon Musk and the Trump administration's cuts to federal agencies. Axon Enterprise CEO Rick Smith testified Tuesday before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Administrative State, Regulatory Reform and Antitrust, detailing the significant hurdles his company faced during a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigation into a 2018 acquisition. Axon sued the FTC in federal district court, challenging the constitutionality of the agency's investigative and adjudicative process. In April 2023, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Axon's favor, and the FTC dismissed its case. Axon develops law enforcement technology, including body-worn cameras. Smith said agencies like the FTC should not have the power to act as "prosecutor, judge and jury." "The unchecked power of the government led to serious consequences for my company, for my employees and deeply for me, personally," Smith said. "The agency wields unchecked powers in ways that can crush innovation, stifle economic growth and deny basic constitutional rights." The Trump administration has waged war against federal agencies and their authority, from freezing the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to halting work at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has cases against companies including Walmart, Capital One and JPMorgan Chase. President Donald Trump also signed an executive order in January launching the 10-to-1 initiative, meaning that for any new rule an agency proposes, it must eliminate 10 others. "It's no secret that regulatory burdens have reached an all-time high," Rep. Scott Fitzgerald (R-Wis.), the subcommittee chair, said during Tuesday's hearing. "The number of rules that agencies create is overwhelming." However, Democrats on the committee spoke against tech entrepreneur Elon Musk's access to sensitive data held by federal agencies as he leads the federal agency overhaul through his leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the subcommittee ranking member, said Musk is usurping Congressional authority and that there is "no check and no balance from the Republican Congress." "As we speak, Elon Musk and his band of near-teenaged accomplices are systematically working their way through the executive branch, knocking down agency after agency, while undermining the rule of law and shredding the constitution along the way," he said. Axon spent years in a legal battle with the FTC, challenging the constitutionality of its processes, Smith said. Axon acquired what Smith described as a small, failing body camera competitor in May 2018 for $13 million. He said the company had been attempting to sell for 18 months, but other competitors declined to buy it. Smith said the acquisition resulted in a "disproportionate government response" and the FTC demanded that the company license its intellectual property to create a "clone competitor." During Axon's dealings with the FTC, Smith said he learned that during the past 20 years, the FTC had won 100% of its cases in its in-house forum. The FTC can use an internal process called an adjudicative proceeding with administrative law judges instead of going to federal court to resolve cases. "This is bigger than one company or one case," Smith said. "Every American, whether an individual or a small or large corporation, should have the right to a fair trial before an independent judge." Magatte Wade, an entrepreneur from Senegal in West Africa and a hearing witness, voiced concerns about overregulation in the U.S., something she said has negatively affected Senegal. Wade is known for speaking against overregulation in Africa. "Even in the U.S., it is difficult for a business person to be fully compliant with all the laws," she said. "In Senegal, I usually have to pay lawyers to make sure I'm compliant all the way. It costs a lot of money and a lot of time and makes me very noncompetitive." Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, said Musk's access to agency data and potential business competitor information should be a higher priority for Congress than a hearing about regulatory reform. Raskin described Musk's attempts to halt work at agencies like CFPB as "scandalous." "That's what we should be having a hearing about, not some academic conversation about the administrative state," he said. Wade said Raskin's words concerned her. She said regulation is a significant topic that merits a Congressional hearing. "As an entrepreneur, my time is valuable," she said. "I came here because I thought we were going to talk about the regulatory state and why it matters. I'm deeply offended by what you said there." While regulations are essential in achieving policy objectives such as protecting public health and the environment, regulatory reform can "reduce unnecessary burdens on businesses and consumers," said Patrick McLaughlin, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, and a hearing witness. "When regulations pile up over time without systematic review, this regulatory accumulation has costly consequences," he said. "Compliance becomes more complex, businesses face mounting overhead costs and entrepreneurs struggle to navigate the maze of over 1 million regulatory restrictions that are currently on the books."

Title: Ozempic and other weight-loss meds may be linked to conditions that could lead to blindness, study says

Popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs, including Ozempic (NVO) and Zepbound (LLY), may have a potential link with several eye conditions that can cause vision loss, according to a new investigatory review published recently in the scientific journal JAMA Ophthalmology. The study focused on nine patients that received prescriptions for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy , or tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound. Seven of the patients developed a rare eye condition known as NAION, a condition in which blood flow in the optic nerve is reduced leading to sudden and irreversible blindness. The condition is the most common optic nerve disease in the United States, affecting up to 10 out of 100,000 older Americans every year, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Another patient developed bilateral papillitis — the swelling of both optic nerve heads. And the ninth patient developed paracentral acute middle maculopathy — the loss of blood flow to a part of the retina. The study authors hypothesized that the conditions were a result of rapid changes in blood sugar levels caused by the drugs, “rather than a toxic effect of the drugs.” “Patient safety is a top priority for Novo Nordisk, and we take all reports about adverse events from use of our medicines very seriously,” a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told Quartz. “This also relates to eye conditions, which are well-known comorbidities for people living with diabetes.” The spokesperson added that Novo Nordisk has conducted an analysis across clinical trials of GLP-1 meds, the class of drugs that semaglutide belongs to, looking at NAION diagnoses and has found no evidence of a causal link between the drugs and the eye condition. Additionally, the spokesperson clarified that NAION is not listed as a known adverse drug reaction for the company’s branded semaglutide products including Ozempic and Wegovy, according to their official labels. Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Quartz. The study’s lead author, Bradley Katz — an opthlamologist and professor at the University of Utah, told MedicalNewsToday that the researchers are not recommending anyone to stop using the popular medications. “What we are recommending is that if you experience a change in your vision while using one of these drugs, you should consult the prescribing doctor and see an ophthalmologist,” Katz said. This review follows two studies from last year that also found a link between semaglutide and NAION. According to the study from December, diabetes patients using Ozempic were found to be over twice as likely to develop NAION compared to those taking other diabetes medications. Still, the study determined that the overall incidence of the condition was exceptionally low, with just 1.4 additional cases per 10,000 patient-years of observation — calculated as the number of patients multiplied by the years they were monitored — among those taking Ozempic compared to users of other diabetes medications. If the risk remains consistent over time, a type 2 diabetes patient taking Ozempic for 20 years would face a 0.3% to 0.5% likelihood of developing NAION, according to the study.

Title: Do Our Courses Need An Update To Reflect The Workings Of Information Businesses?

1936: British actor and director Charles Chaplin (1889 - 1977), wearing overalls and holding a ... [+] wrench, sits on an enormous set of gears in a still from Chaplin's film, 'Modern Times'. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Syllabi at management schools and senior management at perhaps many businesses don’t fully appreciate how information businesses work. I was chatting with a successful Silicon Valley venture capitalist last week about how we may have under-invested in understanding the impact of technology on our economy. The VC suggested, “macroeconomic modeling generally treats technology as an external parameter like Total Factor Productivity, rather than as an endogenously determined, explicitly engineered system. As a result, conventional models struggle to address the most critical structural issues facing the U.S. and global economy. They neither integrate short-run dynamics with long-run growth considerations nor capture how digital technologies — AI, 5G, robotics, 3D printing, zero-cost digital services — are developed, diffused, and shaped by policy and market forces. This limitation leaves unexplored how these technologies affect productivity, output, time use, education, skill requirements, and well-being.” The VC sounds more professorial than me but I am not a macro-economist and hence say much about the above statement. However, I suspect the same sentiment applies at the micro level to technology companies or information businesses, more broadly. I suspect that we have not updated our syllabi and course offerings at management schools as much as we should have, after the U.S. lost its crown as a manufacturing powerhouse. I compared the list of course offerings in say 1998 when I started teaching with what is offered today by top business schools. I found a few changes but nothing radical seems to have been restructured. So, what was taught in 1998 and to a great extent today? I conjecture we mostly teach management insights, as practiced in the manufacturing era. There was a fair degree of excitement about management theories as applied to manufacturing processes back in the day. I am thinking of Fredrick Taylor’s scientific management theories, the Hawthorne experiments, the Japanese ideas of Total Quality Management, lean manufacturing, and GE’s six sigma mindset. None of these ideas, perhaps formulated explicitly for the manufacturing age, fully apply or explain how information companies operate. Consider a summary of these ideas and how these apply or not to the modern information giants: Frederick Taylor is widely recognized for “time and motion” studies conducted in the 1880s where he observed the specific steps a worker takes to lay bricks and the time it takes to go through these steps. The idea is to optimize the number of steps and time taken to accomplish the task. More broadly, Taylor is known for two big ideas: (i) scientific management, based on evidence and observation, as opposed to gut feel and rules of thumb; and (ii) the conflict between management and labor is somewhat unnecessary as both parties would benefit with better productivity which would manifest as higher wages and higher profits. Taylor emphasized standardized tools and procedures. He wanted managers to set specified goals and assign tasks to workers to motivate workers to perform better. He argued that workers should be paid a bonus of 30% to 100% of wages for learning to do the job as per the principles of scientific management. Taylor also advocated individual work and productivity and was somewhat skeptical of group work. Taylor suggested choosing the worker with the right aptitude as such a worker would be far more productive than the average worker. He also pushed for rest pauses and shorter working hours, especially if the task is hard. Taylorism is perhaps the precursor to a lot of what is taught in operations research, human relations and cost accounting courses in B schools. I suspect Amazon relied on time and motion studies to understand how to optimize packing boxes in their distribution centers. The idea of choosing the right worker with aptitude for the job is an established tenet in HR (Human Relations) groups all over the world. The Hawthorne studies are credited with recognizing the influence of human relations or social factors in motivating workers. The Hawthorne researchers found the workers’ response to a managerial intervention is a function of the attitudes the workers bring to their job, the informal work group they belong to, their personal history and their social situation at work. Worker culture in big tech companies is widely discussed. Netflix’s culture deck, which potentially owes its inspiration to the early Hawthorne studies, is legendary in Bay area circles. The deck emphasizes the freedom to excel, deciding which worker is a keeper and paying them a premium over their market wage, the idea that the best workers are 10X better than average, and that teams ought to be highly aligned in their goals but only loosely coupled to stay nimble. The Total Quality Management way of thinking aims to make quality the concern of every member of the firm. Customers are the focus of all activities of the firm and improvements in quality are directed at improving customer satisfaction. Such a focus is expected to lead to better financial performance in two ways: (i) in the manufacturing process, we are expected to encounter fewer defects and rework leading to lower costs and more dependable processes and hence better earnings; and (ii) in the product market, more focus on quality is expected to lead to higher market share, less elastic demand, higher prices and hence higher earnings. The idea of lean manufacturing, a related concept, is to deliver a quality product to the customer at a reasonable cost. Incidentally, Trevor Harris, my co-author and emeritus professor at Columbia Business School, tells me that Edward Deming, another CBS professor, pioneered the thinking behind TQM and even the Six-Sigma movement. I don’t know whether Tesla follows TQM and lean manufacturing but I did come across a help wanted ad from Tesla looking for a quality engineer whose job description sounded similar to what a TQM engineer would do. In a 1997 annual letter Jack Welch sent to GE stockholders, he explains: "Six Sigma project work consists of five basic activities: Defining, Measuring, Analyzing, Improving and then Controlling processes. These projects usually focus on improving our customers’ productivity and reducing their capital outlays, while increasing the quality, speed and efficiency of our operations….The Six Sigma quality initiative, very briefly, means going from approximately 35,000 defects per million operations, which is average for most companies, including GE, to fewer than 4 defects per million in every element in every process that this company engages in every day.” Welch goes on to explain how Six Sigma works with the “A” leaders in each function of the company: “In finance, for example, “A’s” will be people whose talents include, but transcend, traditional controllership. The bigger role is one of full-fledged participant in driving the business to win in the marketplace — a role far bigger than the dreary and wasteful budget “drills” and bean counting that once defined and limited the job. In engineering, “A’s” are those who embrace the methodology of Design for Six Sigma. “A” engineers can’t stand the thought of “riding it out” in the lab, but rather relish the rapid pace of technological change and continually re-educate themselves to stay on top of it. In manufacturing, “A” players will be people who are immersed in Six Sigma technology, who consider inventory an embarrassment, especially with a whiff of deflation in the air — people who understand how to drive asset turns and reduce inventory while at the same time increasing our readiness to serve the customer. In sales, “A” players will use the enormous customer value that Six Sigma generates to differentiate GE from the competition, to find new accounts, and to refresh and expand the old ones — as contrasted with “C” players whose days are spent visiting “friends” on the “milk-run” circuit of customer calls.” Amazon reportedly relied on Six Sigma type ideas to reduce the error rate on their package delivery to minuscule levels considering that they processed 5.9 billion packages in 2023. As stated, modern information businesses, such as Amazon, Google, Meta, Netflix, and Uber, rely on many of these ideas inspired by manufacturing. But these tech businesses also do not seem to fit the traditional mold of management theories well. In a seminal paper written around 2001, Hal Varian discusses ways in which the “new economy” information businesses are different from traditional manufacturing firms: Not quite. Let me start with my home field. Trevor Harris points out that statutory reporting, that is done once a quarter in a rigid regulation bound format, is a relic of a bygone era. Good businesses have a dashboard to track the key KPIs that matter for value creation. Why don’t we ask firms to disclose that dashboard on a more frequent cadence to investors? Of course, there are concerns about proprietary costs and so on, but I have not seen many creative conversations about how to leverage technology and/or better reflect the economics of technology and information businesses in our textbooks and syllabi. For another smaller illustration of this problem, our textbooks treat intangible assets in a somewhat rule-oriented framework. The FASB says X and not X. So, we explain that in the text but rarely take the conversation to the next level to consider how technology creates value. My co-authors and I have a few modest contributions in this area, generally lamenting how little information about value creation potential of technology spending is shared with the investing public and the absence of data to calculate unit economics or lifetime value of a customer but much more needs to be done. I have not seen a good treatment of how cost accounting should think about supply and demand side economies of scale, standards, systems effects and computer mediated transactions. A critic may argue that the basics of cost accounting have not changed. But one must wonder whether the field is stuck around the time manufacturing left the U.S. for Asia. Have we updated thinking in cost accounting for the bundled information products, why some of Amazon’s divisions are never supposed to make money (free shipping, Kindle) so that they can cross-sell other products in the retail store, how does Amazon price the time of developers working on features and software products or how does a firm value its data or the data acquired in an M&A transaction? What kind of cost data does an Amazon, or an Uber collect? Do they conduct cost-volume-profit analyses to determine breakeven sales quantity for a product, given the extent of bundling and portfolio type thinking necessary to accomplish this? How does Amazon calculate the lifetime value of a customer? How is common overhead across segments and how did that practice potentially fund Amazon’s internal capital markets such as books leading to video to music to third party selling to AWS? How does one think about budgeting and sales and cost variances for a modern tech business? A related problem in finance has been the persistent puzzle on how to value intangibles. Absence of even modest accounting data to perform such valuations is a big hindrance. Do frameworks such as real options plausibly explain the valuations of a Tesla or an Amazon or an Nvidia? How does one stress test or falsify these black box valuations? Have the low-interest rate environments, coincidental with the rise of Big Tech, defaulted us to faith-based valuations? How has corporate finance changed with the rise of information businesses? Is capital less of a constraint than skilled labor? How does one come up with capital budgeting for information products or bundled systems? How has cash and liquidity management changed? Has big data and AI improved scenario planning and hence enabled better capital allocation? Has granular data made it easier to dissect why some acquisitions succeeded while others failed? Now, I stray into areas that are not my own and hence rely on observation, as opposed to deep analysis. Marketing and Operations Research are arguably the two disciplines in a B school that have adapted and embraced the practices of Big Tech firms better than other units. There are tons of classes on digital marketing, social influencers, ad platforms, AI offered by these two groups. Human Relations: Jensen Huang’ statement illustrates the profound change that HR groups are/will experience in the near future: “In a lot of ways, the IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of AI agents in the future.” That is, the IT departments of the future will train and “onboard” AI agents as though these were employees to ensure that such agents work to enhance human workers’ productivity. Recruiting is already mediated by AI algorithms, for better or for worse. Work from home, enabled by technology, is not going away. This is already creating profound challenges on how to integrate younger workers into a company. Many of these workers were hired on a zoom call and will potentially not get promoted by senior leaders who don’t know them as individuals or human beings. Ironically, I would suggest that we need to invest more in traditional HR. Do our newer leaders have the training and outlook to look a worker in the eye and say to them in a respectful way that they are being laid off? If they did, we would not come across so many cases of mass layoffs via email or zoom. Our slowness, in the B school, to adapt and teach management practices of Big Tech or enabled by technology in general, would be less of a concern if these considerations only mattered to a handful of tech giants. But that is certainly not the case. I routinely come across senior managers of companies that are both enthusiastically and reluctantly digitizing without fully understanding the profound change that Varian’s forces will have on their firms. This is not to say that people have not worked on documenting management practices at Amazon or the other technology firms. I have not seen a book or a manual or a coherent framework that one can hand to future managers of non-digital firms to prepare for a digital/tech leavy/information dense tomorrow.

The idea of lean manufacturing, a related concept, is to deliver a quality product to the customer at a reasonable cost. Incidentally, Trevor Harris, my co-author and emeritus professor at Columbia Business School, tells me that Edward Deming, another CBS professor, pioneered the thinking behind TQM and even the Six-Sigma movement. I don’t know whether Tesla follows TQM and lean manufacturing but I did come across a help wanted ad from Tesla looking for a quality engineer whose job description sounded similar to what a TQM engineer would do. In a 1997 annual letter Jack Welch sent to GE stockholders, he explains: "Six Sigma project work consists of five basic activities: Defining, Measuring, Analyzing, Improving and then Controlling processes. These projects usually focus on improving our customers’ productivity and reducing their capital outlays, while increasing the quality, speed and efficiency of our operations….The Six Sigma quality initiative, very briefly, means going from approximately 35,000 defects per million operations, which is average for most companies, including GE, to fewer than 4 defects per million in every element in every process that this company engages in every day.” Welch goes on to explain how Six Sigma works with the “A” leaders in each function of the company: “In finance, for example, “A’s” will be people whose talents include, but transcend, traditional controllership. The bigger role is one of full-fledged participant in driving the business to win in the marketplace — a role far bigger than the dreary and wasteful budget “drills” and bean counting that once defined and limited the job. In engineering, “A’s” are those who embrace the methodology of Design for Six Sigma. “A” engineers can’t stand the thought of “riding it out” in the lab, but rather relish the rapid pace of technological change and continually re-educate themselves to stay on top of it. In manufacturing, “A” players will be people who are immersed in Six Sigma technology, who consider inventory an embarrassment, especially with a whiff of deflation in the air — people who understand how to drive asset turns and reduce inventory while at the same time increasing our readiness to serve the customer. In sales, “A” players will use the enormous customer value that Six Sigma generates to differentiate GE from the competition, to find new accounts, and to refresh and expand the old ones — as contrasted with “C” players whose days are spent visiting “friends” on the “milk-run” circuit of customer calls.” Amazon reportedly relied on Six Sigma type ideas to reduce the error rate on their package delivery to minuscule levels considering that they processed 5.9 billion packages in 2023. As stated, modern information businesses, such as Amazon, Google, Meta, Netflix, and Uber, rely on many of these ideas inspired by manufacturing. But these tech businesses also do not seem to fit the traditional mold of management theories well. In a seminal paper written around 2001, Hal Varian discusses ways in which the “new economy” information businesses are different from traditional manufacturing firms: Not quite. Let me start with my home field. Trevor Harris points out that statutory reporting, that is done once a quarter in a rigid regulation bound format, is a relic of a bygone era. Good businesses have a dashboard to track the key KPIs that matter for value creation. Why don’t we ask firms to disclose that dashboard on a more frequent cadence to investors? Of course, there are concerns about proprietary costs and so on, but I have not seen many creative conversations about how to leverage technology and/or better reflect the economics of technology and information businesses in our textbooks and syllabi. For another smaller illustration of this problem, our textbooks treat intangible assets in a somewhat rule-oriented framework. The FASB says X and not X. So, we explain that in the text but rarely take the conversation to the next level to consider how technology creates value. My co-authors and I have a few modest contributions in this area, generally lamenting how little information about value creation potential of technology spending is shared with the investing public and the absence of data to calculate unit economics or lifetime value of a customer but much more needs to be done. I have not seen a good treatment of how cost accounting should think about supply and demand side economies of scale, standards, systems effects and computer mediated transactions. A critic may argue that the basics of cost accounting have not changed. But one must wonder whether the field is stuck around the time manufacturing left the U.S. for Asia. Have we updated thinking in cost accounting for the bundled information products, why some of Amazon’s divisions are never supposed to make money (free shipping, Kindle) so that they can cross-sell other products in the retail store, how does Amazon price the time of developers working on features and software products or how does a firm value its data or the data acquired in an M&A transaction? What kind of cost data does an Amazon, or an Uber collect? Do they conduct cost-volume-profit analyses to determine breakeven sales quantity for a product, given the extent of bundling and portfolio type thinking necessary to accomplish this? How does Amazon calculate the lifetime value of a customer? How is common overhead across segments and how did that practice potentially fund Amazon’s internal capital markets such as books leading to video to music to third party selling to AWS? How does one think about budgeting and sales and cost variances for a modern tech business? A related problem in finance has been the persistent puzzle on how to value intangibles. Absence of even modest accounting data to perform such valuations is a big hindrance. Do frameworks such as real options plausibly explain the valuations of a Tesla or an Amazon or an Nvidia? How does one stress test or falsify these black box valuations? Have the low-interest rate environments, coincidental with the rise of Big Tech, defaulted us to faith-based valuations? How has corporate finance changed with the rise of information businesses? Is capital less of a constraint than skilled labor? How does one come up with capital budgeting for information products or bundled systems? How has cash and liquidity management changed? Has big data and AI improved scenario planning and hence enabled better capital allocation? Has granular data made it easier to dissect why some acquisitions succeeded while others failed? Now, I stray into areas that are not my own and hence rely on observation, as opposed to deep analysis. Marketing and Operations Research are arguably the two disciplines in a B school that have adapted and embraced the practices of Big Tech firms better than other units. There are tons of classes on digital marketing, social influencers, ad platforms, AI offered by these two groups. Human Relations: Jensen Huang’ statement illustrates the profound change that HR groups are/will experience in the near future: “In a lot of ways, the IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of AI agents in the future.” That is, the IT departments of the future will train and “onboard” AI agents as though these were employees to ensure that such agents work to enhance human workers’ productivity. Recruiting is already mediated by AI algorithms, for better or for worse. Work from home, enabled by technology, is not going away. This is already creating profound challenges on how to integrate younger workers into a company. Many of these workers were hired on a zoom call and will potentially not get promoted by senior leaders who don’t know them as individuals or human beings. Ironically, I would suggest that we need to invest more in traditional HR. Do our newer leaders have the training and outlook to look a worker in the eye and say to them in a respectful way that they are being laid off? If they did, we would not come across so many cases of mass layoffs via email or zoom. Our slowness, in the B school, to adapt and teach management practices of Big Tech or enabled by technology in general, would be less of a concern if these considerations only mattered to a handful of tech giants. But that is certainly not the case. I routinely come across senior managers of companies that are both enthusiastically and reluctantly digitizing without fully understanding the profound change that Varian’s forces will have on their firms. This is not to say that people have not worked on documenting management practices at Amazon or the other technology firms. I have not seen a book or a manual or a coherent framework that one can hand to future managers of non-digital firms to prepare for a digital/tech leavy/information dense tomorrow. Constructive comments welcome, as always.

Title: Do Our Courses Need An Update To Reflect The Workings Of Information Businesses?

1936: British actor and director Charles Chaplin (1889 - 1977), wearing overalls and holding a ... [+] wrench, sits on an enormous set of gears in a still from Chaplin's film, 'Modern Times'. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Syllabi at management schools and senior management at perhaps many businesses don’t fully appreciate how information businesses work. I was chatting with a successful Silicon Valley venture capitalist last week about how we may have under-invested in understanding the impact of technology on our economy. The VC suggested, “macroeconomic modeling generally treats technology as an external parameter like Total Factor Productivity, rather than as an endogenously determined, explicitly engineered system. As a result, conventional models struggle to address the most critical structural issues facing the U.S. and global economy. They neither integrate short-run dynamics with long-run growth considerations nor capture how digital technologies — AI, 5G, robotics, 3D printing, zero-cost digital services — are developed, diffused, and shaped by policy and market forces. This limitation leaves unexplored how these technologies affect productivity, output, time use, education, skill requirements, and well-being.” The VC sounds more professorial than me but I am not a macro-economist and hence say much about the above statement. However, I suspect the same sentiment applies at the micro level to technology companies or information businesses, more broadly. I suspect that we have not updated our syllabi and course offerings at management schools as much as we should have, after the U.S. lost its crown as a manufacturing powerhouse. I compared the list of course offerings in say 1998 when I started teaching with what is offered today by top business schools. I found a few changes but nothing radical seems to have been restructured. So, what was taught in 1998 and to a great extent today? I conjecture we mostly teach management insights, as practiced in the manufacturing era. There was a fair degree of excitement about management theories as applied to manufacturing processes back in the day. I am thinking of Fredrick Taylor’s scientific management theories, the Hawthorne experiments, the Japanese ideas of Total Quality Management, lean manufacturing, and GE’s six sigma mindset. None of these ideas, perhaps formulated explicitly for the manufacturing age, fully apply or explain how information companies operate. Consider a summary of these ideas and how these apply or not to the modern information giants: Frederick Taylor is widely recognized for “time and motion” studies conducted in the 1880s where he observed the specific steps a worker takes to lay bricks and the time it takes to go through these steps. The idea is to optimize the number of steps and time taken to accomplish the task. More broadly, Taylor is known for two big ideas: (i) scientific management, based on evidence and observation, as opposed to gut feel and rules of thumb; and (ii) the conflict between management and labor is somewhat unnecessary as both parties would benefit with better productivity which would manifest as higher wages and higher profits. Taylor emphasized standardized tools and procedures. He wanted managers to set specified goals and assign tasks to workers to motivate workers to perform better. He argued that workers should be paid a bonus of 30% to 100% of wages for learning to do the job as per the principles of scientific management. Taylor also advocated individual work and productivity and was somewhat skeptical of group work. Taylor suggested choosing the worker with the right aptitude as such a worker would be far more productive than the average worker. He also pushed for rest pauses and shorter working hours, especially if the task is hard. Taylorism is perhaps the precursor to a lot of what is taught in operations research, human relations and cost accounting courses in B schools. I suspect Amazon relied on time and motion studies to understand how to optimize packing boxes in their distribution centers. The idea of choosing the right worker with aptitude for the job is an established tenet in HR (Human Relations) groups all over the world. The Hawthorne studies are credited with recognizing the influence of human relations or social factors in motivating workers. The Hawthorne researchers found the workers’ response to a managerial intervention is a function of the attitudes the workers bring to their job, the informal work group they belong to, their personal history and their social situation at work. Worker culture in big tech companies is widely discussed. Netflix’s culture deck, which potentially owes its inspiration to the early Hawthorne studies, is legendary in Bay area circles. The deck emphasizes the freedom to excel, deciding which worker is a keeper and paying them a premium over their market wage, the idea that the best workers are 10X better than average, and that teams ought to be highly aligned in their goals but only loosely coupled to stay nimble. The Total Quality Management way of thinking aims to make quality the concern of every member of the firm. Customers are the focus of all activities of the firm and improvements in quality are directed at improving customer satisfaction. Such a focus is expected to lead to better financial performance in two ways: (i) in the manufacturing process, we are expected to encounter fewer defects and rework leading to lower costs and more dependable processes and hence better earnings; and (ii) in the product market, more focus on quality is expected to lead to higher market share, less elastic demand, higher prices and hence higher earnings. The idea of lean manufacturing, a related concept, is to deliver a quality product to the customer at a reasonable cost.

Title: Who Owns the World? The Boom-Bust Bailout Process that Placed Nations in Debt

There are systemic aspects about the banking, monetary, and economic system that are not taught in the schools and universities of the world and are rarely discussed on corporate owned news and media networks. Knowledge of these aspects is absolutely essential for everyone in the world that wishes to understand how the economic world ‘actually’ works and how worldwide society has been brought to the brink of financial ruin (currently almost all governments of the world are in vast debt) while the vast resources of human productivity and of nature are continually exploited by a small group of people that control these systems. See also the book Demonic Economics and the Tricks of the Bankers. This article explores: Without GDP growth the (privately owned) debt-money banking system fails. The real reason governments prioritise GDP growth is so that sufficient tax monies can be collected so that interest can be paid to the international banking system. Governments often maintain that the ultimate purpose of economic GDP growth is in fact to improve wellbeing. This is not in fact so. John Jopling (RIP) of the Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability wrote in 2003: “The real reason why governments regard growth as desirable is that, with a debt-based money system, if the economy does not grow, it collapses. This is something all politicians are naturally and rightly extremely keen to avoid. Growth is an absolute imperative imposed on governments by the nature of the current money system. Thus, it is in the nature of the money system, not the choice of government, that growth must be maintained.”[1] Governments are buried under the lie, they do not admit or have the awareness that the need for GDP growth is imposed by the debt-money system controlled by private banks nor that the creation of debt money by private banks is unnecessary and is against the public interest (because governments could create and issue debt-free money themselves as has been done in the past). It is rarely acknowledged by politicians that the main reason for the constant drive for GDP growth is to pay interest to the banking system. The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability has stated: “The way in which the global economic system is designed automatically ensures that the economy operates in such a way that: a. inequality is bound to increase, b. the economy is unstable and c. the economy is blind to the limits of natural resources and the need for humanity to live in symbiosis with the rest of the natural world.” – The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainabilit[2] GDP growth is prioritised by governments and debt-money is the basis of the banking system – yet both are significant drivers of environmental degradation, resource depletion, and social inequity. A government prioritises growth, yet whether it is ‘good’ growth or ‘bad’ growth is not the focus (good growth would not impact on environmental and social resilience.) The pseudo-science of neo-classical economics (that all governments adhere to) proposes that increased GDP growth can reduce pollution in what is called the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). This EKC argument is false. The EKC posits that pollution increases with economic growth in the early stages of development and that beyond a certain level of development the trend reverses, and economic growth improves environmental conditions by creating the resources to do so. However, the EKC has never been validated. Vastly excessive consumerism has been required to keep the system from derailing. The debt-money system increases and reduces the availability credit at will often creating ‘boom, bust and bailout’ cycles – this means that the economic system is unstable by nature. If sufficient loans are not repaid to a commercial bank it will become insolvent. This has happened in many countries, for example in various countries in Europe during the banking crisis of 2008. . The collapse of Lehman Brothers (headquarters pictured), the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank, on September 15, 2008, is often considered the climax of the 2008 financial crisis. (Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0) . [Aside: Bear in mind that these private banks never held the original monies in the first place, and, the cruel bait and switch is that it is actually the people that are the grantors of credit when they sign a mortgage or loan (a promise to pay), however, the bank typically never pays back the grantor of the credit. Including interest one typically pays the bank about twice the amount of the loan or mortgage. Yet, the bank does not pay equity for that promissory note, and presumes that we have abandoned our securities]. Typically a national government then intervenes to bail out those commercial banks, being under pressure to do so from the international banking system. Furthermore, by controlling the availability of credit the private banking cartel created boom-bust-bailout cycles, at will, which placed nations in further debt. For example, the European Central Bank (ECB) exerted pressure on the Irish government to bail out private banks and unsecured bondholders in 2010. In 2012 RTE, Ireland’s National Television Service reported that the ECB informed an Irish Government Minister that “a bomb will go off in Dublin” if Anglo bondholders are not paid. “He [Minister for Transport and Tourism, Leo Varadkar] said that the Troika told the Government that “we don’t want you to default on these payments, it is your decision ultimately but a bomb will go off; and the bomb will go off in Dublin and not in Frankfurt.” – RTE reporting Minister Varadkar’s comments 22nd January 2012. [Note: The Troika is a term used to describe the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).] Furthermore, a letter was sent by the ECB to pressure the Irish Government to accept a bailout. In that letter then ECB head Jean-Claude Trichet told Ireland in November 2010 that it would not extend further emergency funding to the country’s banks if Dublin did not sign up to a bailout, according to the letter which was finally released after years of lobbying. The so-called global banking crises of 2008 represented an opportunity for a re-evaluation of the values that our banking system and economic system are based on. Moreover, it represented an ideal opportunity for transition toward a more sustainable, resilient, just, and, perhaps even, a more ethical society. Alas, this opportunity was spurned, and almost all governments bailed out the banks. This results in increased taxes, national austerity measures and/or the privatisation of national assets due to conditionalities on credit. For example, in Ireland the government must pay around €6 billion to €10 billion per annum in interest on the national debt of €235 billon[3] – a significant portion of this debt (€85 billion) was incurred due to bailing out private commercial banks in Ireland in 2008[4]. To understand the magnitude of this debt if you convert into U.S. dollars and lay $1 bills on top of each other they would make a pile 28,581 km, or 17,760 miles high. These debts will never be fully repaid and the annual interest payments alone are, in effect, a never-ending shackle of debt servitude and a form of slavery for the Irish people. Similar bailout situations have occurred in many other countries worldwide. “There are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation. One is by the sword. The other is by debt.” – U.S. President John Adams The banking system can and does control the availability of credit (i.e., debt-money loans). It can expand or contract the availability of credit in a nation or worldwide. Over the past decades the more credit that is available the more an economy is likely to grow (there are also other factors including the availability of a cheap energy source, such as oil). When the availability of credit is contracted/reduced by the banking system the money supply shrinks, the availability of money to repay loans plus interest is reduced, foreclosures begin to occur and the economy may start to shrink rather than grow. This expansion and contraction of credit is known as the business cycle. “The fact that the necessary growth can be achieved only by increasing the total level of debt makes the economy heavily dependent on confidence… The economy therefore constantly moves between boom and bust; it is systemically unstable.” – John Joplin and Roy Madron, authors of ‘Gaian Democracies’[5] “The bankrupt country must borrow from international banks and the IMF, which impose a condition of debt relief that the national government may not issue its own money. If the government tries to protect its resources or its banks by nationalizing them for the benefit of its own citizens, it is branded communist, socialist or terrorist and is replaced by one that is friendlier to free enterprise.” – E.H. Brown, Author of the book ‘The Web of Debt’ Author Bob Djurdjevic associates these cycles, which have been experienced by many countries, to what he calls the Wall Street dominated New World Order terrorists: “The Wall Street dominated New World Order (NWO) Empire is being built by colonizing other countries with foreign loans or investments. When the fish is firmly on the hook, the NWO financial terrorists pull the plug, leaving the unsuspecting victim high and dry. And begging to be rescued. In comes the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Its bailout recipes – privatisation, trade, liberalization and other austerity reforms – amount to seizing the target countries’ natural resources, and turning them over to the NWO elites – just as surely as the British Empire did by using cruder methods.” – Bob Djurdjevic, Chronicles Journal[6] The boom-bust-bailout process can be summarised, as follows: Many people’s perceptions are that social programs are targeted to assist poorer people lower down the socio-economic scale. However, the 2008 banking crisis in Europe and the U.S. was a clear example of socialism for the banks and extremely wealthy bondholders. The failing banks that were reckless with their lending and investment practices still got “rewarded” with vast quantities of government bailout monies because they were regarded as “too big to fail”. The attempted justification for such bailouts is that it is in the people’s interests that the banks are kept alive. However, in reality it is the working-class and middle-class tax-payers that are typically forced to shoulder the disproportionate brunt of the bailout, which is in effect a huge transfer of people’s labour and money to the already mega-wealthy bondholders and private owners of the banks. In summary, a private-banking cartel has been able to create booms and busts and drive nations into bankruptcy and bailout using the Problem, Reaction, Solution approach or the Hegelian Dialectic. The reality of this flawed monetary system became apparent to many millions of people in 2008 when the so-called banking crises hit in the U.S. and in Europe. As usual, it was the people that were forced to pay for the debts of privately owned banks. In Ireland, the debts of the private banks were the controversially guaranteed by the Irish government, thereby placing the debt burdens onto the Irish citizens. According to a poll by the Irish Independent in 2010 a substantial majority of the Irish people wanted the State to default on debts to bondholders (See endnote 38). Furthermore, as I noted in a blog in 2010 [7] the people of Ireland did not agree to the use of billions of their monies being used to bail out privately owned banks. There was no national referendum on the issue. The bailout of the private banks by the Irish government prompted much public anger, yet, the mainstream media in Ireland appeared to be generally aligned with the government narrative. A number of commentators and bloggers had criticised the government’s bailout plans to no avail. For example, the following is an extract from an article titled “We must face down the jackals who control the international banking system to save our nation and protect our children’s future” by Robert Pye, a former Irish Department of Finance Analyst: “THERE IS considerable truth in the view that Ireland is no longer a sovereign state but an impoverished suburb of Brussels. Four million people are mired deep in a collective debt that is not of their own making… They call us PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) because that is what you do with a pig: tie him upside down, slit his throat and drain him dry. Well, I for one reject this disgusting epithet. I also reject utterly the despicable arrogance with which this country is being treated, and the servile ineptitude of those who pose as our leaders. Unless we take a stand and defend our sovereignty, our integrity and our children, we will be destroyed as a nation.”[8] Richard Douthwaite (1942 – 2011) an economist and writer, wrote a relevant article in relation to the planned bailout in Ireland titled “Bailout talks: four truths Ireland can’t ignore”[9]. The following is an extract: “Ireland’s negotiations with the ECB and the IMF are perhaps the most important talks that this country has engaged in… If Ireland has to pay interest on the loans being negotiated at a rate which exceeds the rate at which the economy grows over the next few years, it will make the country’s situation worse, not better… The ECB bears a large share of the responsibility for the regulatory failure which led to the property bubble… There is a Plan B. Ireland doesn’t have to take anything that is offered. It can leave the euro quickly and easily… If the deal offered by the ECB/IMF negotiators is unsatisfactory, the Irish government can simply announce… a new currency… and all wages, rents, debts and other payments are to be paid in harp with immediate effect… After the announcement the government would issue itself with the new currency on a debt-free basis so that it no longer needed to borrow to cover its budget deficit… Ireland has no alternative but to renege on the guarantees and to build itself a future within the EU but outside the eurozone.” An article on broadsheet.ie in 2010 titled “The Senior Bondholders: An Analysis”[10] provided an analysis of who the bondholders actually were that were benefitting from the Irish tax-payer funded government bailout of privately owned insolvent banks. Many of the bondholders were privately held banks “mostly” owned by extremely wealthy individuals. An extract from the article is as follow: “SO…. on one side we have Ireland whose bond holders, its people, have between them a total GDP wealth of 0.207 trillion euros. Who are being FORCED, against their will, to pay Anglo Irish bank’s debts to its bond holders, who between them hold 20.8 Trillion euros. The people of Ireland are paying to, and protecting the wealth and power of, people who have 100 times more wealth!… So who are they? Well many of the bond holders are privately held banks, which list their activities as asset management for off-shore, non-resident and high value individuals.” The following is also a relevant excerpt from an article[11] written by author and blogger Charles Hugh Smith in November 2010 that summarises the situation and the opportunity Ireland had to dis-empower “the vampire banks” which had the world by the throat: “When a nation such as Ireland is running a State deficit equal to 32% of GDP, austerity cannot generate the stupendous surpluses needed to make good the vast sums which are already lost… Ireland, and indeed the world, will survive if all the vampire banks are liquidated. That is the end-state, and “buying time” just increases the misery of the citizens who have been yoked to save their “betters.” Ireland, please drive a stake through the heart of the vampire banks which have the world by the throat. By defaulting, you would be doing the world (and your own nation) an immense favor.” The following extract from a wiki project[12] describes the different responses to the debts of private banks in Iceland and Ireland. Iceland is an interesting example of how a country can stand up against the IMF. “The “Icelandic Solution” involved repudiation. Private banks were allowed to fail and social security measures for the poor and indebted were increased… The UK went so far as to trigger anti-terrorism legislation against Icelandic banks in a bid to pressure Iceland to pay out claims against its private banks… Self-interested bankers are therefore often desperate to avoid government debt default, and generally much prefer an economy to be strangled by debt rather than be freed of it… The Irish government on the other hand, guaranteed private bank debt and in doing so subjected the taxpayers of that country to decades of payments for debts that were not incurred on their behalf or for their benefit. This could be interpreted as theft through the taxing of future generations tomorrow to pay off creditors of private bankers today. Many commentators have observed that in 2010. Iceland recovered much faster than other countries such as Ireland.” When you get a mortgage, loan, or a credit card, the debt money is created out of thin air when you sign on the dotted line of the contract, yet you will have to work (maybe for years) to generate the money to pay back to the bank plus interest – in essence, this is a form of slavery as the bank never had the money in the first place. Income tax monies collected by governments from the people is one of the methods used to service the debt governments owe to the international finance system, money that was originally created entirely from nothing by privately-owned mega-banks. “Federal income tax was instituted specifically to coerce taxpayers to pay the interest due to the banks on the federal debt. If the money supply had been created by the government rather than borrowed from the banks that created it, the income tax would have been unnecessary. … There is a way out of this morass. The early American colonists found it and so did Abraham Lincoln and some other national leaders: the government can take back the money-issuing power from the banks. “ – Ellen Brown, Author of the book ‘The Web of Debt’ “Between usury and taxes the consumer is really played for a sucker. God’s law permits no property tax for it is discriminatory… It discourages stability and brings about a shifting, irresponsible citizenry with no ties to the land. Under our present system, accident, sickness, or old age easily dispossesses a man of his home but in no way reduces his expense….” – Dr. Franklin Snook, Author of America Needs the Divine Law Over decades the power to create debt-money has resulted in the power to own, control and manipulate the assets of the material world, as well media and politics. Those that control the money creation process wield the power to control the corporate media and own the material world, regardless of which political party is elected, or which system is utilised (capitalism, socialism, communism, etc). This mean that many aspects of our lives are in reality controlled from a moneyed source not from a democratic source. This power grab was achieved not by creating more value, but by fully controlling the source of money and the world of finance. A pyramid of control has existed. The higher up you go the closer you get to the source of money creation. At the bottom level we are all going about our daily lives. At the next level up are governments. These are people who are given a monopoly on force and use it to tax and control the population whether or not we agree. The election of new government leaders via representative democracy is an illusion of people power. The vast regulatory systems of government in essence never change. But who controls the governments? It is not the people of the nations that control governments, this is evidenced by the banking bailouts in Europe after 2008. There was no referendum on the subject, the governments simply complied with the wishes of international private banking corporations. At the next level up are the mega corporations and at the next level beyond the corporations is the privately owned worldwide banking cartel. Over decades the mega-corporations have acquired the world’s resources and controlled the markets. To do so they needed access to cheap money. The mega corporations got their loans at special rates from the mega banks. We can conclude that those who control the mega banks ultimately control the mega corporations. “Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.. when you realise that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.“ – James Garfield (20th President of the U.S. – assassinated 1881). “The … bankers rule the world through debt, which is money they create out of nothing. They need world government to ensure no country defaults or tries to overthrow them. As long as private bankers, instead of governments, create money the human race is doomed. These bankers and their allies have bought everything and everyone.” – Henry Makow, Author Also note the comments of Congressman Charles McFadden, Chairman, House Banking and Currency Committee, June 10, 1932: “Some people think the Federal Reserve Banks are U.S. governments institutions. They are not… they are private credit monopolies which prey upon the people of the U.S. for the benefit of themselves and their foreign and domestic swindlers, and rich and predatory money lenders… These twelve private credit monopolies were deceitfully foisted upon this Country by the bankers who came here from Europe and repaid us our hospitality by undermining our American Institutions… The sack of the United States by the FED is the greatest crime in history. Every effort has been made by the FED to conceal its powers, but the truth is the FED has usurped the government. It controls everything here and it controls all foreign relations. It makes and breaks governments at will.” – Congressman Charles McFadden. The major shareholders in the commercial banks are other banks and asset management companies and trusts. For example, asset management company Blackrock has large shareholdings in mega-banks Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Chase and other banks[13], yet those same banks have major shareholdings in Blackrock. The list of shareholders is diversified amongst various privately owned financial and asset management corporations. In essence, all these various financial entities are interlocked and own each other – the current dominant worldwide privately owned financial orthodoxy is one large self-reinforcing entity under the tentacles of many financial corporations. A study[14] was conducted at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland, on the relationships between 37 million companies and investors worldwide, and there is a ‘super-entity’ of just 147 tightly knit mega-corporations that controls 40 percent of the entire global economy. and all of their ownership was held by other members of the super-entity. According to James B. Glattfelder, one of the authors of the study: “In effect, less than 1 per cent of the companies were able to control 40 per cent of the entire network,” Most were financial institutions and included Barclays Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and The Goldman Sachs Group. The dominant players appear to be the banking families that have been operating private banking for generations. The involvement of certain banking families in private banking for generations is mentioned in books including ‘The Web of Debt’ by Ellen Brown, chair of the U.S. Public Banking Institute. Families that are often mentioned in relation to the banking industry include the Rothschild banking dynasty[15] (associated with US Trust owned by Bank of America), The Rockefeller world business empire (associated with Citigroup), the Schiff’s, the Morgan’s[16] (associated with Morgan Stanley, etc.), and the Warburg’s. Author Dean Henderson writes in an article[17]: “The Four Horsemen of Banking (Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo)… According to company 10K filings to the SEC, the Four Horsemen of Banking are among the top ten stock holders of virtually every Fortune 500 corporation… One important repository for the wealth of the global oligarchy that owns these bank holding companies is US Trust Corporation – founded in 1853 and now owned by Bank of America. A recent US Trust Corporate Director and Honorary Trustee was Walter Rothschild… [18]” Furthermore, according to Ellen Brown, chairperson of the Public Banking Institute in the U.S. asset management companies, such as Blackrock, literally own much of the U.S. and the world. She states: “BlackRock has a controlling interest in all the major corporations in the S&P 500, it professes not to “own” the funds. It just acts as a kind of “custodian” for its investors — or so it claims. But BlackRock and the other Big 3 ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) vote the corporations’ shares; so from the point of view of management, they are the owners. And as observed in a 2017 article from the University of Amsterdam titled “These Three Firms Own Corporate America” they vote 90% of the time in favor of management.”[19] In a 2018 review titled “Blackrock – The Company That Owns the World’[20], a multinational research group called Investigate Europe concluded that BlackRock “undermines competition through owning shares in competing companies”. The major shareholders of Blackrock are all mega-banks and financial corporations, such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citi Group, Wells Fargo and Company, Morgan Stanley, and other various other banks[21]. So, privately owned commercial banks own Blackrock and the other major asset management companies that own most of the world. Author Karen Hudes, who worked in the legal department of the World Bank for more than 20 years, has cited the above Swiss study during an interview with the New American[22] pointing, out that a small group of entities, mostly financial institutions and especially central banks, exert a massive amount of influence over the international economy from behind the scenes. According to Hudes “What is really going on is that the world’s resources are being dominated by this group,” and that “corrupt power grabbers” have managed to dominate the media as well. According to Hudes, the power grabbers also dominate the organizations that control the creation and flow of money worldwide and control the finances of virtually every nation in the world. These organizations include The World Bank, the IMF and central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, all of which are unelected and unaccountable. Author E.H. Brown states that: “Secrecy has been maintained because the robber barons have been able to use their monopoly over money to buy up major media, educational institutions, and other outlets of public information. While Rockefeller was buying up universities, medical schools, and the Encyclopedia Britannica, Morgan bought up newspapers… By 1983,.. fifty corporations owned half or more of the media business. By 2000, that number was down to six corporations, with directorates interlocked with each other and with major commercial banks.[23]” For more information see also the book Demonic Economics and the Tricks of the Bankers. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: The impact of Trump's tariffs is already being felt

Hello there! Business Insider saw a list of nearly 30 staffers at the White House DOGE office. The group, which is helping Elon Musk embark on a massive reshaping of the federal government, consists of mostly early and mid-career professionals. In today's big story, new tariff plans spell trouble for Canada while the trade war is already impacting influencer marketing. What's on deck Markets: The consultants and podcasters trying to demystify how the world's largest hedge funds are run. Tech: Meta's performance-based cuts don't mean it's done hiring. Business: President Trump's buyout plan for federal workers is still on pause. But first, more trade trouble. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Another day. Another tariff. President Donald Trump is targeting steel and aluminum with his latest tariff plans, enacting a 25% tax on the metal imports. That's set to have a big impact on Canada, a top supplier of both steel and aluminum to the US, writes Business Insider's Allie Kelly and Madison Hoff. Mexico, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, and China are also big metal exporters to the US. What's bad for our trading partners is good for some American companies. Before the tariffs were even official, shares of US Steel still jumped as much as 6% on Monday. The trade taxes are a double win for local steel producers, writes Matthew Fox, as it will limit foreign companies' ability to flood the US market with lower-priced steel while also giving them the flexibility to raise their prices. Investors in gold have also been big winners, as precious metals could be hit with tariffs next. More broadly, gold has been viewed as a safe haven amid constant uncertainty over the threat of new tariffs. The impact of tariffs is already being felt in another corner of the economy. Some fashion brands are pausing influencer campaigns and blaming it on US tariffs, write BI's Amanda Perelli, Dan Whateley, and Geoff Weiss. Halara and Shein are pausing some campaigns as they assess what the tariffs will mean for their businesses. It's yet another blow to an industry grappling with the threat of a TikTok ban. But it's also far from the only market facing tariff-related headaches. If things escalate to the point where countries implement retaliatory tariffs on the US, S&P 500 firms could see an 8% hit to their earnings, according to Bank of America. A lot of the concerns over tariffs remain speculative, though. And some have long dismissed Trump's trade plans as a negotiation tactic to obtain better trading terms. But even if that's the case, the uncertainty surrounding what will and won't happen continues to cause problems. Nike had the buzziest Super Bowl ad on social media, data shows. 1. Sorry, coffee drinkers. Your morning cup of joe might start costing more. Eggs aren't the only breakfast staple under pressure. Coffee prices are expected to climb this year thanks to supply snags that could exacerbate the shortage of beans, BofA analysts said. Last week, Arabica coffee prices closed at an all-time high of $4.04 per pound — and analysts said they expect coffee retail prices to keep going up. 2. Video game stocks are looking to notch a new high score. Pent-up demand for long-awaited releases like Grand Theft Auto 6 and the Nintendo Switch 2 is boosting video game companies' shares. The Global X Video Games & Esports ETF is up 12% this year, far outstripping the S&P 500's 3% year-to-date return. 3. Demystifying big-name hedge funds. Former portfolio managers are launching podcasts, Substacks, and consulting firms to assist with talent development and offer an inside look at top funds like Citadel and Point72. These voices also give prospective PMs and analysts a reality check on what it really takes to succeed at those companies. (Hint: It's a lot of hard work.) 1. Meta speeds up hiring despite layoffs. As the social media giant slashes thousands of low performers from its workforce, Meta is also expediting its hiring process for engineers. It's specifically focused on machine-learning, according to an internal memo. 2. AI is Gen Z's work buddy. A growing number of Gen Z workers leverage AI at the office, from drafting emails to conducting research. While AI's proponents say it can free up their time to focus on higher-level responsibilities, others caution against relying too heavily on the technology. Still, older workers need to keep pace. 3. The Elon Musk v. Sam Altman feud continues. Musk and a group of investors submitted an unsolicited offer to buy "all assets" of OpenAI Inc. for $97.4 billion. "It's time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was," Musk wrote. Altman quickly dismissed the offer, leading to a back-and-forth exchange between the two on X. 1. Former federal workers for hire … but not too many yet. As a judge continues to pause the federal worker buyout plan, economists are weighing in on what the resignations could mean for the labor market. So far, the number of people who accepted the offer is relatively low, and many may plan to retire anyway. But things could heat up further as federal funding tightens. 2. How Fox is (sort of) getting back with its exes. YouTube isn't the only media company betting on podcasts. Fox Corp. bought Red Seat Ventures, a podcasting company that happens to handle production and ad sales for former Fox News stars Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly, and Bill O'Reilly. BI's Peter Kafka breaks down the move. 3. TikTok Shop challenges Amazon with its new subscription feature. In the latest move to compete with its e-commerce peers, TikTok Shop is testing a subscription feature, similar to Amazon's subscribe-and-save tool, that would allow users to repeatedly receive products in exchange for a discount. The feature would help sellers lock in recurring revenue and manage shipment amid sale surges from viral videos. Amazon has more than 750,000 robots working in its fulfillment centers. Here are some of the things they can do. Senate Finance Committee hearing on Donald Trump's nominee for US trade representative.

The trouble started when an ex-director, Suet Meng Chay, transferred a 12 per cent stake—nominally valued at ₹10.28 crore—to an NRI based in Dubai, Jahangir Panikkaveettil Perumbarambathu, for a token amount of just $1. He was supposedly a stranger, who Sebi suspects to be linked to the promoter family through Meta. This token-dollar transfer set off an alleged pump-and-dump strategy orchestrated through connected entities to artificially inflate the stock price. This enabled the NRI as well as the promoter, and connected entities to sell shares at a higher value, the regulator observed. A series of early-morning buy orders at the upper circuit limits were seen driving the share price from a low of around ₹22.50 to an astronomical high of ₹267.50 within two months—even though the company’s financials showed negligible revenue and virtually no business activity. “At the dollar-rupee conversion rate of ₹83.75, this made the purchaser richer by $328.60 million (₹2752 crore) at the company’s peak market capitalization of ₹22,700 crore. The said transaction not only appears to be too good to be true, but also raises the possibility of FEMA violations,” said SEBI’s whole-time member Ashwani Bhatia in the interim order. Bhatia said that the case painted a picture of “absurdities and anomalies,” and required interim action before another pump and dump takes place and more innocent investors lose money and burn their fingers. He noted that the number of public shareholders has nearly doubled in six months to 6,106 as on December 31, 2024. “There is a real risk of the noticees off-loading their shares at the cost of investors, who get drawn to the shares of the company seeing high valuations and volumes and would end up getting duped and taken for a ride…Further, action needs to be taken promptly to prevent more money leaving the shores of India through sale of shares by the NRI shareholder,” the order said. The regulator will be conducting a detailed investigation in the matter by May 15. In the meantime, Sebi has directed the NRI to provide a full inventory of his assets, investments, and bank accounts, as well as freeze any debits in his accounts.

Title: Can AI Fix Succession Planning?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspremuzic/2025/02/11/can-ai-fix-succession-planning/

Succession planning sign and figurines with arrows. Few decisions in business and leadership matter more than choosing the right successor. When done well, it ensures continuity, preserves institutional knowledge, and often propels an organization to new heights. When done poorly, it can lead to instability, lost value, and even outright failure. Consider the success stories: Tim Cook taking over from Steve Jobs at Apple, seamlessly continuing and even accelerating the company’s trajectory, boosting the company’s market cap from around $340B under Steve Jobs to over $3T now (if you invested $10,000 of Apple stock at the start of Cook's tenure you would have around $160,000 right now). The figures are similarly impressive for Satya Nadella’s impact at Microsoft, who arguably had a bigger strategic and innovation effect by not just rejuvenated the company, but also shifting its focus first from Windows to cloud computing, and more recently and AI (anticipating the current AI boom). Even Pope Francis’s ascension after Pope Benedict XVI’s resignation demonstrated the power of a well-managed leadership transition, bringing fresh energy and a sense of modernity and empathy (not to mention an instant PR upgrade) to the Vatican, a 2,000-year institution. Contrast that with the pitfalls of poor succession planning. Since legendary Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson retired, the club has been cycling through multiple coaches (seven and still counting) without much financial or sporting success, and the decline appears to be ongoing. In the corporate world, J.C. Penney’s appointment of Ron Johnson as CEO led to a dramatic and costly strategic misfire. And in the hit show Succession, the fictional Roy family’s lack of a clear plan for leadership leads to chaos, power struggles, and a tanking stock price, which makes for great television but a horrific case study in succession. Back in the real-world, succession stories captivate the public’s attention. Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH and one of the richest people in the world, is known to have been interviewing each of his five children for the big job, fostering speculation about his eventual successor. In recent years, Warren Buffett announced his successor, but at 94, Buffett still maintains a hands-on role in managing Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. As for Jamie Dimon, there is seemingly no end to the uncertainty about his successor. These cases all highlight the same truth: leadership transitions can make or break an organization. The Science and Art of Succession Planning At its core, succession planning is part science and part art. The science is well established: industrial-organizational psychology offers robust and reliable frameworks for assessing leadership potential, ensuring a data-driven approach to selection, and derisking the process (including the significant probability that incompetent men become leaders). Predictive analytics, performance reviews, and evidence-based competency models help organizations make objective choices. Yet, the process is also partly an art — navigating internal politics, winning over key stakeholders, and crafting a shared vision for the future. As in any other area of life, AI has the potential to bring rigor and objectivity to the science while enhancing the human aspects of the art. Here’s how: 1. Evaluating Past Performance Beyond Politics The barrier to data-driven succession planning is contamination in past performance data, which corrupts a proper examination of candidates’ track record and potential, introducing invisible biases in the process, and contaminating candidates’ “score” with politics, subjectivity, and noise (the nefarious 9-box grid, the unreliable supervisor or managerial ratings, and the political high-potential nominations). AI can mitigate this by analyzing vast amounts of historical performance data, including predictive signals usually missed by the “naked” human eye, and finding hidden patterns that connect each candidate with different success profiles. By measuring real contributions—financial results, operational efficiencies, strategic insights, and even mining granular signals, such as language, meta-data, the depth and breadth of social networks, and markers of leadership style and dynamics — AI can cut through biases, ensuring the most qualified leaders rise to the top based on merit, not alliances. To be sure, asking AI to predict who would normally be nominated in a given organization will probably not result in an upgrade from past and current candidates, but rather more of the same (which is rarely the right choice when it comes to effective successions). 2. Expanding the Talent Pool for More Inclusive Assessments Historically, succession planning has been limited to a narrow group of insiders, often overlooking diverse and high-potential candidates among unconventional or outgroup profiles. AI-driven talent identification can analyze broader datasets to uncover hidden gems, ensuring organizations consider leaders from different backgrounds, functions, and geographies. In essence, innovations in assessments have leveraged AI to improve the candidate experience, reduce test-taking time, and increase the speed and efficiencies of putting a much larger sample of potential candidates through the assessment. Since quantity leads to quality, making assessment inclusive will generally improve the quality of your final choice, as well as increasing the range of candidates and profiles you can shortlist. 3. Using Passive Data to Predict Leadership Success AI can leverage passive data—communication patterns, collaboration metrics, and behavioral insights — to assess leadership traits. The work of David Stillwell, Sandra Matz and Michal Kosinski demonstrates how AI can infer personality traits and leadership potential from digital footprints, as well as internal company data not historically seen as critical to leadership talent. In essence, you want leaders to be smart, driven, and ethical, and each of these foundational ingredients of leadership potential can be broken down into narrower traits (e.g., expertise, curiosity, learning ability, motivation, conscientiousness, EQ, people-skills, integrity) that are expressed, display and reflected in people’s online behaviors (captured by internal company data or in the external digital universe). By incorporating these insights, organizations can move beyond traditional assessments and gain a more holistic view of a candidate’s fit. In fact, even generative AI and large language models provide an easy way to access the public reputation of many senior leaders. For instance, try prompting ChatGPT to give you a leadership and personality profile for Elon Musk, Donald Trump, or Angela Merkel, and you will see there is not much left for a traditional executive assessment to add (same goes for many less famous leaders, including those mentioned at the beginning of this article). 4. Debiasing Leadership Selection Unconscious and conscious biases remain a significant issue in leadership transitions, including when succession planning is driven by a desire to enhance “culture-fit” (which is a subliminal and politically legitimized way to perpetuate the existing organizational biases that confer privilege to the historical in-group, the status-quo, and the ruling elite). AI can flag potential biases in hiring and promotion decisions, ensuring selections align with data rather than stereotypes. For example, when AI is trained to predict who would get promoted and it recommends a surplus of Middle-aged white male engineers, it is accurate exposing existing biases in the organization. Humans are (usually) very good at learning, but very bad at unlearning. Conversely, AI is good at both learning and unlearning. Thus, we can train AI to not just identify the kind of leader who has succeeded in the past, but the kind of leader we would need for the future, if we simply program or prompt it to seek for relevant signals of potential while ignoring irrelevant signals. In contrast, humans will never be able to ignore a candidate’s gender, age, race, social class, or attractiveness, all of which conflates and distorts their choices. By training algorithms on diverse, high-performing leadership examples, companies can create models that prioritize competence and potential over legacy and favoritism, increasing meritocracy (which even those who have jumped on the anti-DEI bandwagon should appreciate). Ethical Considerations Of course, AI is not a magic bullet. Ethical concerns around data privacy, algorithmic bias, and transparency must be addressed. AI should be a tool to enhance human judgment, not replace it. Leaders must ensure AI is used responsibly—applying it as a guide rather than a dictator. The one advantage here, is that AI does not need to be perfect in order to bring about progress. In fact, all it must do is to produce an improvement over the status-quo, which is a very low bar. Indeed, even in its current form AI is less biased than humans – not because AI is perfect, but because humans are biased by design. With AI, as with any other technology, the goal is not instant perfection, but incremental improvements over the current state-of-affairs, and finding better ways of being wrong. To be sure, there are no reasons whatsoever to have confidence in humans eliminating their own biases, but human ingenuity and expertise has been able to create a tool, a technology, that may well de-bias human decision making – but we must open to not just having ethical and competent humans involved in the design and auditing of these algorithms, but also remove them from the decision-making look (as they are often more likely to introduce than eliminate biases). The Future of Leadership Selection AI won’t eliminate the need for human intuition and relationship-building in succession planning, but it can elevate decision-making. By focusing on objective performance evaluation, expanding candidate pipelines, leveraging behavioral insights, and reducing bias, AI has the potential to make leadership transitions smoother, fairer, and more effective. The future of leadership isn’t about human vs. machine. It’s more likely human with machine — using AI as a partner in one of the most crucial tasks any organization faces: securing its next great leader.

Title: 10 Red Roses - $14.13 Delivered @ Harris Farm Markets via Uber Eats
URL: https://www.ozbargain.com.au/node/893009
Time Published: 2025-02-11T05:07:40Z

Not sure why they are so cheap but they are 50% off the already bargain price and it's also possible to schedule a delivery for any day this week. Bear in mind you might be taking a risk of it being out of stock if scheduling for Valentine's Day. Price is $11.04 + $1.99 Delivery Fee + $1.10 Service fee for a total of $14.13. Pink roses are even cheaper, $12.93 for 10 delivered. Tried in a couple of different states and seems to be available everywhere I've checked. $0 Delivery Fee on your First Order. Referrer receives something too (Likely free delivery on next order). Cannot be stacked with new user signup codes. Not in SA. These guys deliver free anywhere. $12.99 delivery fee for me lol Still a bargain if you compare what others are charging. $15.99 delivery for me Couldn't find Harris Farm Markets in Brisbane, QLD - there is one a suburb over, so a little surprised. Oh well. I tried Sydney (city) and Gold Coast (Southport) was the same price. Can't find Clayfield store. Automatically chooses Redfern. Same! Didn't have the pick up option for West End - so I put in Harris Farms as the delivery address with the instructions to meet me out the front of the store. Fingers crossed. I'm in Zillmere and it worked for me (assume it's the Clayfield store). Managed to get 50% a large bouquet ($35 down from $70) and added a block of chocolate to get it over $40 to save an additional $20. Spent less than $25 to get both! Oof, nice. I can't even find this item at the Clayfield store at all, is it still there? How? I'm in North Lakes and can't seem to order - delivery not availabe. Username checks out. Delivered on Valentine’s Day? You can schedule a delivery for then as you can with any Uber Eats delivery. (At your own risk ofc) Thanks OP!! Ordered now let's see if they show up in the next hour as the app says they will!! Don't forget to add an eggplant/cucumber/zucchini for an extra $0.59!!! Does she need something to make up for what you lack?! :) Yes Then just pay $0.59, forgo the flowers. Great deal. You can schedule delivery for Friday (Valentine’s Day). What a win! Scheduled but what are the odds of these being delivered on valentines day! My guess is 'slim' but you never know, Harris Farm have pretty good customer service in my experience. You would hope that they would hold back the stock for delivery for those orders already made. No clue what these roses will look like when or if the come on Friday but worth a gamble! Ps make sure you say refund if out of stock to avoid any replacements at higher prices. Thanks op Any clue where the option/setting is to do this in the UE app? I stumbled onto it at checking my scheduled orders. what these roses will look like Got them delivered a couple hours ago. They looked really nice. Was braced for a lot less. Plain wrap, no extra frills. ( But I only got 9, not 10 ☹️ ). Is it the same price in store? Could go for some mortadella Looks like it's $22 in store, where I checked anyway No love for Melburnians! And no —- either! 40 flowers for $28.60 Thanks OP Time to sell them on the side of a busy road. How did you get $20 off ? This targeted deal Girlfriend is either gonna be really disappointed or really impressed. Either way I can't lose You never loose to GF. You lose when she becomes wife So, always win by staying as her BF ? A win win if you can 😄 @Username Taken: You believe you win; she wins with the lawyers. yeah i thought i was winning when GF became wife but nope lol Do these come wrapped in paper at the stems or how are they sent out. Mine came as a bouquet in paper. Not showing as an available SKU for Harris Farms Chatswood/Willoughby. Might be expired/OOS. On checkout page is states: "promotions are estimates, not guaranteed, and may depend on item and promotion availability in store, you will be charged the in-store price for available items in your cart". Is that mean if schedule on Friday and no 50% off promotion on that day, you will get charge full price? Nothing says I love you more than having an unwashed man with pungent B.O arrive with flowers… This is why you should always use a delivery driver. Or have a shower. $15.99 delivery in Canberra $6.49 for me ($0 as UberOne) for delivery from Harris Majura. You could try pickup? $4 service fee. Free delivery for me since I spent $30. Getting it delivered from Majura Park $17 delivery for me (uber one) Make sure you're ordering from Majura Park Harris Farm lol Yes, indeed I tried a Weston Creek address and a city address and both saying too far. Wth If you're an UberOne member apparently there's no delivery fee. I'm not and the delivery fee is $15.99. Nice - 40 roses delivered for $26.18! (20x Red + 20x Pink, less $20 off $40 spend promo with free delivery for Uber One!). I give this ~10% chance of showing up, but if it does then that's a huge win! Thanks OP! Update: 20/40 roses delivered this morning! But it's a good news story, after an ~$11 refund, that's still 20 roses delivered on Valentines Day morning for $15. Call that a win! Fingers crossed DD does a repeat of last year's deal with the free flowers from Coles :P $15.49 delivery fee. Does Uber One cover the delivery fee for stores that are farther away? Legend Pink roses are even cheaper OP can't work out why he is single OP made it this year and shared ozb with 50% off 'bedroom ticket'. Ordered. Cancelled… I am single and just ordered a bunch of roses for myself Western Sydney was out of stock and double the price. CBD worked A-OK. Hope they are delivered! Thanks OP Woah nice price. Thanks Tried ordering from a few stores in Sydney and wouldn't let me check out, said I had to cancel my order. Ordered two bunches of 10 long stem red roses. Got two bunches of 5 long stem pink roses. Have raised a support case with Uber Eats. Harris Farm Boronia Park in Sydney. How did they come, curious if it comes in paper or how the bottom is wrapped. Thanks They came wrapped in plastic cellophane type stuff, bottoms exposed, placed in a paper Harris farm bag Getting jipped with colour and quantity. FrankGrimes has a right to vent ! Yes same happened with me - ordered red then pink arrived. Not sure if the uber eats rider picks them or they are picked and bagged by the store? Either way, they were refunded, just follow the links to report an issue with the order and take a picture I reported it last night but have heard nothing back from Uber Eats support. Useless Strange! Mine seemed to be refunded immediately (and automatically) with no fuss Anybody know of some good options like this but in Melbourne? $6.99 delivery fee for me (Canberra) :( Item replaced - Sydney. What was yours replaced with? Not a cat I hope :D Haha nothing with a tail. Use this to chase tail. Just a heads up, it comes with the pricing sticker attached. It's also wrapped in a black piece of plastic with the flower sticking out the top Thanks for the info, does it come with any name/payment details aswell? In my case just in a Harris Farm brown paper grocery bag within which was the 10 stem bouquet. Ordered the red bouquets, got white. Went through Uber Eats to complain, got a refund immediately- minus $1.99 delivery. $1.99 for the 10 long stems white roses, yes please. Winning Easy enough to dye them red! Winning! Do you have a picture? Was it the original price or the discounted price on the sticker? Original price $15.99 just for delivery in Sydney - crazy. Not if you’re 20km from the nearest Harris Farm.. I got $2.99 delivery fee in Sydney, however it was deducted (I don't have Uber One) and only $1 service fee charged. I was able to choose the date and the tile slot. 10 stem bunch of Blue Iris for $7.64 delivered. That's almost free. Free delivery. Booked to tomorrow arvo. 15 yrs married and no flowers, let's see if this yr is a winner. Too far from store :(, won’t even allow me to enter pickup Harris Farm? Uber Eats? where is the nutritional value on this? Roses out of stock in Qld but ordered a different bunch + choccies and chippies, total $30. Mrs will be stoked. Which store? West end Uber one but also paid more at checkout (NSW) Thought I’d get in early and order today. Flowers were unavailable (red roses) selected colored roses which was an upsell. Waited and order wasn’t cancelled anyway. Maybe plan ahead or have plan b ready. Ended up getting 2 bunches from QE foodstores for 50% off.. not a bad alt or choice if available to you. Worked out cheaper than Harris Farm with good options. Not available in regional area (Northern NSW) and the price has also changed to $24.80. The price of all of the flowers have gone up today compared to yesterday. I had some in my cart to order this morning and the discounted price had gone up over $4 per bunch. Was ordering multiple bunches of different flowers. All have gone up in price, some quite significantly. Can anyone comment on the quality of these ? Ordered two bunches for my girlfriend and wife.

February 10, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI), Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT), Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT), and MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) Class Period: January 19, 2024 - September 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Kaspi class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/KSPI Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT) Class Period: January 3, 2024 - December 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 The complaint alleges that on November 27, 2024, Applied Therapeutics issued a press release announcing that it had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat, the Company’s lead drug candidate. The CRL indicated that the FDA completed its review of the application and determined that it was unable to approve the NDA in its current form citing deficiencies in the clinical application. Following this news, the price of Applied Therapeutics’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $10.21 per share on November 26, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $8.57 per share on November 27, 2024 before falling further to $2.03 on November 29, 2024 and $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, a total decline of more than 80%. After market hours on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics disclosed it received a “warning letter” from the FDA referring to the clinical trial issues underlying the CRL. Applied Therapeutics’ disclosure of the “warning letter” prompted a further decline in the stock price as investors discovered the seriousness and severity of the Company’s clinical trial errors. From a closing market price of $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $1.69 per share on December 3, 2024 before falling further to $1.38 per share on December 4, 2024 and $1.29 per share on December 5, 2024. For more information on the Applied Therapeutics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APLT Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) Class Period: February 1, 2024 - August 1, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 25, 2025 The filed complaint alleges that defendants made false statements and/or concealed that: (a) the impact of project delays on Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects was far more severe than represented to investors; (b) permitting and interconnection delays had materially impaired Nextracker's ability to convert backlog into revenue at historical conversion rates; (c) Nextracker had been unable to offset the negative impact from project delays through increased client demand and the purported ability to pull forward its other projects in the manner represented by defendants; (d) Nextracker did not possess the competitive advantages which purportedly shielded it from industry-wide headwinds or the ability to effectively offset the adverse effects of project delays as claimed by defendants; and (e) as a result of (a)-(d) above, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects. For more information on the Nextracker class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NXT MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI) Class Period: May 4, 2023 - October 30, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 14, 2025 MGPI is a manufacturer of hard liquors such as tequila, bourbon, rye, whiskey, vodka, and gin. MGPI sells the spirits it produces under its own brands as well as to other alcohol distributors and brands. Prior to the Class Period, sales of hard liquors, such as those produced and sold by MGPI, increased dramatically in the wake of COVID-19. However, as quarantines ended, sales of hard liquors slowed across the alcoholic beverage industry, and a backlog of inventory began to increase. The Complaint alleges that during the Class Period, MGPI falsely assured investors that its projections and statements accounted for the industry slowdown and that it was well-positioned to avoid a buildup of inventory. The Company also claimed that its projected sales took these industry trends into account. MGPI announced on October 17, 2024, that a slowdown in demand and an excess in inventories would undermine sales. This revelation caused the Company’s stock to plummet 29.5%. Then, less than two weeks later, on October 31, 2024, Defendants revealed that its excess inventory would have an even greater impact than previously reported. This caused the Company’s stock to drop another 14.7%, to a close of $49.04 per share on October 31, 2024. In total, MGPI’s share price declined nearly 50% on these two disclosures, wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars in market capitalization and damaging investors.

February 10, 2025 19:00 ET | Source: Skyharbour Resources Ltd Skyharbour Resources Ltd Vancouver, BC, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Skyharbour Resources Ltd. (TSX-V: SYH) (OTCQX: SYHBF) (Frankfurt: SC1P) (“Skyharbour” or the “Company”), is pleased to announce that, further to its news release dated November 4th, 2024, closing has occurred on the option agreement (the “Agreement”) with Hatchet, whereby Hatchet Uranium Corp. (“Hatchet”) may acquire an 80% interest in the Company’s 17,606 ha Highway Uranium Property (the “Optioned Property”) and a 100% interest, subject to a claw-back provision for Skyharbour, in the Company’s Genie, Usam and CBX/Shoe Uranium Projects (the “Purchased Property”). The properties total 66,358 ha and are all located in the Athabasca Basin of Northern Saskatchewan, Canada. The Agreement on the Optioned Property provides Hatchet an opportunity to earn an 80% interest in the claims over a three-year period by fulfilling combined cash, share issuance and exploration expenditure commitments of CAD $3,345,000. For the Purchased Property, Skyharbour will also receive units in the capital of Hatchet consisting of a share and a warrant (“Hatchet Units”) equal to 9.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Hatchet. Highway, Genie, Usam, CBX and Shoe Project Map:https://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/images/Sky_Highway.jpg Terms of the Optioned Property: The Optioned Property, Highway, consists of nine (9) mineral claims comprising approximately 17,606 hectares. Hatchet may acquire an 80% interest in the Optioned Property by (i) issuing common shares in the capital of Hatchet (“Shares”) having an aggregate value of CAD $1,050,000; (ii) making aggregate cash payments of CAD $245,000; and (iii) incurring an aggregate of CAD $2,050,000 in exploration expenditures on the Optioned Property over a three-year period, as follows: (1) Deemed pricing of Shares is based on the twenty (20) day volume weighted average price on the stock exchange in which Hatchet shall list its Shares for trading, being either the TSX Venture Exchange or the Canadian Securities Exchange (“Deemed Price”) or the last sale price, if not listed on a stock exchange at the time of issuance. In the event that the issuance of any Shares pursuant to the above would result in the Company holding 10% or more of the outstanding Shares of Hatchet, Hatchet will issue that number of Shares which would result in the Company receiving 9.9% of the issued and outstanding Shares post-issuance and will pay cash in lieu of the Shares for the difference. The Company shall retain a 2% net smelter returns royalty from minerals mined and removed from the Optioned Property, of which Hatchet may purchase one-half, being 1%, at any time for $1,000,000. Terms of the Purchased Property: The Purchased Property consists of twenty-five (25) mineral claims comprising approximately 66,358 hectares across the Genie, Usam and CBX/Shoe projects. Hatchet has acquired a 100% interest in the Purchased Property by, on the date of closing (the “Closing Date”), paying the Company $25,000 and issuing to the Company such number of Units in the capital of Hatchet equal to 9.9% of the issued and outstanding shares immediately following the issuance. Each Hatchet Unit shall be comprised of one Share and one share purchase warrant, entitling Skyharbour to purchase one additional Share for a period of three years at a price that is a 25% premium to the deemed value of the Shares in both years 1 and 2, and then increases to a 50% premium to the issuance value of the Shares in year 3. The Company shall retain a claw-back provision whereby, within 90 days after the 3rd anniversary of the Closing Date, the Company may elect by written notice to Hatchet of its intention to purchase back a twenty-five percent (25%) interest in the Purchased Property by, within 90 days of delivery of such notice, incurring exploration expenditures or paying cash in lieu of to fund future exploration, equivalent to fifty percent (50%) of the total amount that Hatchet had spent during the term that is three years from the Closing Date in exploration expenditures on the Purchased Property. If Hatchet has not incurred any exploration expenditures during the three years following the closing date, then Skyharbour shall automatically receive the 25% interest in the Property. The Company shall also retain a 2% net smelter returns royalty from minerals mined and removed from the Purchased Property, of which Hatchet may purchase one-half, being 1%, at any time for $2,000,000. One of the conditions precedent for Hatchet prior to closing on both agreements was to close a financing for minimum gross proceeds of $1,500,000 which is now complete. Furthermore, Hatchet will proceed to list on the TSX Venture Exchange or the Canadian Securities Exchange or will have sold its interest to or combined with a similarly listed issuer. If this is not complete within 18 months, Hatchet’s right to acquire the Purchased Property will terminate. If after 12 months Hatchet has not listed then it shall pay Skyharbour a monthly fee of $10,000 until such conditions are satisfied or an aggregate of $60,000 has been paid, whichever occurs first. Highway Property Summary: The Highway Uranium Project consists of nine claims covering 17,606 hectares, approximately 41 km south of the Rabbit Lake Mine and 11 km southwest of Uranium Energy Corp.’s (UEC, formerly UEX) West Bear U and Co-Ni Deposits. Highway 905 runs through the property, providing excellent access for exploration and the project is in close proximity to regional infrastructure. There has been limited modern exploration carried out on the project but there is the potential for high-grade basement-hosted and unconformity-related uranium mineralization. Highway Property Map:https://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/images/Sky_Highway.jpg‎ The project is underlain by Wollaston Supergroup metasedimentary gneisses (pelitic to psammopelitic and psammitic to meta-arkosic) folded around and overlying an Archean felsic gneiss dome which outcrops in the southwestern portion of the property and cores a northeast trending antiformal fold nose. The Highway Project is located approximately 7 km east of the present-day margin of the Athabasca Basin but is believed to have been covered by Athabasca sandstone in the past. Genie Property Summary: The Genie property consists of five claims totalling 16,930 ha, and is located approximately 48 km northeast of Cameco’s Eagle Point Uranium Mine (Rabbit Lake Operation) and 40 km north of Wollaston Lake Post. The project is underlain by Wollaston Superground metasedimentary gneisses and Archean granitoids, with highly prospective pelitic to psammopelitic gneisses (including graphitic varieties) and several north-trending faults related to the Tabbernor fault system being mapped on the property. The project lies outside the current extent of the Athabasca Basin, but is believed to have been overlain by now-eroded Athabasca sandstones in the past and has the potential for high-grade basement-hosted and unconformity-related uranium mineralization. The property is underlain by a series of linear magnetic highs (interpreted as granitoids) and magnetic lows (interpreted as metasedimentary gneisses), cross-cut by a highly magnetic northwest-trending Mackenzie Diabase dyke. Genie Property Map:https://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/images/Sky_Genie.jpg Previous work on the Genie project includes limited diamond drilling (three historical drill holes, of which one was abandoned in overburden) and a variety of airborne and ground geophysical surveys, prospecting, geological mapping, lake sediment and overburden sampling, and soil sampling. Most of this exploration work took place between 1966 to 1980, prior to the advent of modern geophysical methods and geological models, but in 2014 part of the Genie property was covered by a helicopter-borne DIGHEM magnetic, electromagnetic, and radiometric survey. The survey showed a strong central EM conductor following a magnetically inferred contact on the two northeastern most claims, which is locally disrupted by several moderately conductive N-S trending structural breaks, inferred to be faults. This strong conductor is highly prospective for uranium mineralization, and drilling done in 1969 and 1971 has confirmed the presence of graphitic and sulfide-containing pelitic gneisses on the property. Lake sediment samples also collected at Genie during the 2014 exploration program, contained up to 63.3 ppm U, further showcasing the prospectivity of the property. Usam Property Summary: The Usam Project consists of twelve claims totalling 40,041 ha and is located approximately 16 km northeast of Cameco’s Eagle Point Mine (Rabbit Lake Operation). The project has numerous EM conductors that are associated with significant magnetic lows of the Wollaston Domain. While the project is outside the current confines of the Athabasca Basin, the area was overlain by Athabasca sandstones historically. Basement rocks on the property include Wollaston Supergroup metasediments and Archean granitoid gneisses, with highly prospective pelitic to psammopelitic gneisses (including graphitic varieties) making up the largest proportion of the basement rocks. Several north-trending faults related to the Tabbernor fault system cross-cut the property. Usam Property Map:https://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/images/Sky_Usam.jpg Previous work on the project includes diamond drilling (12 holes), lake sediment sampling, soil sampling, geological mapping, ground and airborne geophysics, marine seismic, prospecting, and other geochemical sampling, the majority of which was done in the 1980’s and 1970’s. Modern exploration of the property has been limited to geophysics and ground prospecting. As such there is a significant untested potential on the project. Trenching on Cleveland Island uncovered up to 0.31% U3O8 in mineralized pegmatite, and diamond drilling on Gilles Island intersected anomalous uranium, indicating that the basement rocks underling the Usam property are fertile sources of uranium in addition to containing pegmatite- and granite-hosted U-Th-REE mineralization. There are also several sedimentary-hosted base metals (i.e. Cu and Zn) showings on the project and in the surrounding area, which show similarities to the sedimentary-hosted Cu mineralization previously discovered by Rio Tinto and its partners at the Janice Lake Project further southwest in the Wollaston Domain. CBX/Shoe Property Summary: The CBX property has been recently expanded through staking to include five additional claims adjoining the previously staked CBX and Shoe properties, which have been combined to include a total of seven claims covering 8,777 hectares. The 609 ha Shoe property has remained unchanged, with both CBX and Shoe now consisting of eight non-contiguous claims totalling 9,386 hectares. CBX/Shoe Property Map:https://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/images/Sky_Shoe.jpg‎ The new claims lie approximately 6.5 km to 25 km northeast of the Eagle Point uranium mine and cover the northern shore of Wollaston Lake including parts of Cunning Bay. Outcrop exposure on the property is poor, but historical mapping and drilling shows that the newly expanded CBX project is underlain by a mixture of Wollaston Supergroup metasedimentary gneisses, Hudsonian intrusives, and Archean felsic gneisses of the Western Wollaston Domain. Similar lithologies host uranium mineralization at the Rabbit Lake operation, including the Eagle Point deposit, and other uranium deposits in the Athabasca Basin and surrounding regions. The CBX and Shoe properties have had historical exploration, including airborne and ground geophysical surveys, lake sediment, soil, and spruce geochemical surveys, till sampling, prospecting, geological mapping, and a marine seismic survey, but the majority of this work took place in the 1960’s to 1980’s, with limited modern exploration work being carried out on a small portion of the CBX and Shoe properties. Grant of Incentive Stock Options: Skyharbour also announces that the Company has granted 3,500,000 incentive stock options (the "Options") to officers, directors and consultants of the Company. The Options are exercisable at $0.40 per share for a period of five years from the date of grant. The Options have been granted under and are governed by the terms of the Company's Incentive Stock Option Plan. Qualified Person: The technical information in this news release has been prepared in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101 and reviewed and approved by Serdar Donmez, P.Geo., VP of Exploration for Skyharbour as well as a Qualified Person. About Skyharbour Resources Ltd.: Skyharbour holds an extensive portfolio of uranium exploration projects in Canada's Athabasca Basin and is well positioned to benefit from improving uranium market fundamentals with interest in thirty-six projects covering over 614,000 hectares (over 1.5 million acres) of land. Skyharbour has acquired from Denison Mines, a large strategic shareholder of the Company, a 100% interest in the Moore Uranium Project, which is located 15 kilometres east of Denison's Wheeler River project and 39 kilometres south of Cameco's McArthur River uranium mine. Moore is an advanced-stage uranium exploration property with high-grade uranium mineralization in several zones at the Maverick Corridor. Adjacent to the Moore Project is the Russell Lake Uranium Project, in which Skyharbour is operator with joint-venture partner RTEC. The project hosts widespread uranium mineralization in drill intercepts over a large property area with exploration upside potential. The Company is actively advancing these projects through exploration and drilling programs. Skyharbour also has joint ventures with industry leader Orano Canada Inc., Azincourt Energy, and Thunderbird Resources at the Preston, East Preston, and Hook Lake Projects, respectively. The Company also has several active earn-in option partners, including CSE-listed Basin Uranium Corp. at the Mann Lake Uranium Project; TSX-V listed North Shore Uranium at the Falcon Project; UraEx Resources at the South Dufferin and Bolt Projects; Hatchet Uranium at the Highway Project; CSE-listed Mustang Energy at the 914W Project; and TSX-V listed Terra Clean Energy at the South Falcon East Project. In aggregate, Skyharbour has now signed earn-in option agreements with partners that total to over $36 million in partner-funded exploration expenditures, over $20 million worth of shares being issued, and $14 million in cash payments coming into Skyharbour, assuming that these partner companies complete their entire earn-ins at the respective projects. Skyharbour's goal is to maximize shareholder value through new mineral discoveries, committed long-term partnerships, and the advancement of exploration projects in geopolitically favourable jurisdictions.

Title: AI Replacement? Meta Cuts 3,600 Jobs To Focus On AI Talent

WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 31: Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, testifies before the Senate Judiciary ... [+] Committee at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Jan. 31, 2024 in Washington, D.C. The committee heard testimony from the heads of the largest tech firms on the dangers of child sexual exploitation on social media. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Perhaps the biggest threat to our jobs isn’t AI — but other, more talented people. Or so seems to be the case with Meta’s latest batch of layoffs. The tech giant is about to cut thousands of employees as part of a larger effort to phase out “low-performers” and rope in fresh meat for its AI expansion, Bloomberg reported. Affected workers were notified via email earlier today. According to Bloomberg’s sources, Meta is handing severance packages that include 16 weeks of pay in addition to two weeks of additional pay for each year of service. Employees with performance reviews that merited a bonus are expected to still get one, and staffers are still entitled to stock awards as part of the upcoming vesting cycle later this month. U.S. employees will be first to be notified of the layoffs, with international colleagues expected to be informed later, although the timeline for that is uncertain. Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg announced the cuts will affect about 5% of the workforce — about 3,600 people — starting with hires that “aren’t meeting expectations.” The plan is to use the resources from the layoffs to power its AI development and focus on securing the “strongest talent.” After a long streak of staving off layoffs, this marks yet another round of cuts at Meta. Notably, the company parted ways with thousands of employees in 2022 and 2023. For his part, Zuckerberg has previously spoken about Meta’s plans to inject billions into building out its AI infrastructure, which will power multiple products and services across its lineup, including but not limited to Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook and Threads. That’s hardly a surprise considering the speed at which Meta’s rivals like Amazon, Google and OpenAI are accelerating their AI efforts. DeepSeek’s entry into the fray has only further heated up the AI race for supremacy. As Sam Altman reflected in a recently penned essay on AI, “the intelligence of an AI model roughly equals the log of the resources used to train and run it.” Zuckerberg seems to be of the same mind — hence why Meta is shuffling spending around to lure in more AI talent.

Meta began notifying employees affected by its previously announced job cuts on Monday (Feb. 10). The company’s emails notifying those who were being let go marked the beginning of a process that is expected to continue through the end of Meta’s performance cycle that goes to the end of February and result in terminations of as many as 3,600 employees, Bloomberg reported Monday. While U.S. staffers are being notified Monday, international employees could learn later, according to the report. With this headcount reduction, Meta aims to lay off “low performers” before adding new talent that will aid the company’s competitiveness in the artificial intelligence market, the report said. It was reported in January that Meta planned to cut about 5% of its workforce and that the employees affected by the cuts would be notified Feb. 10. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote at the time in an internal message, per a CNBC report: “Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world. AI, glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.” It was reported Friday (Feb. 7) that AI investments by the four biggest tech firms — Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft — jumped 63% last year and will jump again in 2025 to reach a combined capital expenditure that could surpass $320 billion. Executives at these companies are pledging to up their investments in AI, pushing aside worries about the massive amounts they’re spending on the technology. This year will also be a decisive one for Meta’s metaverse efforts. It was reported Feb. 3 that Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth told employees in Reality Labs — the home of Meta’s metaverse and wearables products — that “this year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.” During Meta’s latest earnings call, Zuckerberg told analysts that while the number of users of the company’s Quest and Horizon offerings has been growing, “we’re going to know a lot more about Horizon’s trajectory by the end of this year.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Bird flu creates short supply of eggs and prices keep rising

WESTCHESTER COUNTY, New York (WABC) -- Iris Katz arrived at the Trader Joe's in Hartsdale on Monday on a mission to buy some eggs. The mission failed. "Not even hard-boiled eggs," Katz said. "I'll try other places?" Even if she found the eggs, Trader Joe's now limits sales to one dozen per customer. "To ensure that as many of our customers who need eggs are able to purchase them when they visit Trader Joe's," said a company spokesperson. The short supply and the ever-present demand for eggs mean price hikes for consumers. According to the USDA, the average price of a dozen eggs is now $7.95, up from $3.30 this time last year. "I really noticed around December. The price was crazy. And normally, around the holiday times, it always goes down," shopper Dina Rose said. The egg shortage and resulting price hikes are the direct result of the highly contagious bird flu, which has decimated the number of egg-laying hens. Governor Kathy Hochul said inspectors recently detected bird flu at seven live poultry markets in Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn. The governor has ordered two live markets in Westchester County to close, clean, and disinfect their premises. The same order applies to markets in Nassau and Suffolk counties, even though inspectors never detected bird flu at those locations. "It was $6.99 for a dozen, and I said forget about it. So my daughter buys at Costco, and she buys a bunch of them," shopper John Esposito said. We visited the Costco in Yonkers. They had eggs in stock at the cost of $8.49 for two dozen, but Costco also issued a limit of 3 cartons per customer. Analysts say stabilizing the egg supply centers on containing the bird flu outbreak and repopulating the number of egg-laying hens. They estimate that the process could take months. ---------- * Get Eyewitness News Delivered * Follow us on YouTube * More local news * Send us a news tip * Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

February 10, 2025 17:15 ET | Source: ValOre Metals Corporation ValOre Metals Corporation VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ValOre Metals Corp. (“ValOre”; TSX‐V: VO; OTCQB: KVLQF; Frankfurt: KEQ0) today provided an update on developments concerning Hatchet Uranium Corp. (“Hatchet”), in which ValOre currently holds an approximate 51.5% partially diluted ownership interest. ValOre, further to its news releases dated November 4th, 2024, and February 5th, 2025, announces that closing has now occurred on the option agreement (the “Agreement”) with Skyharbour Resources Ltd. (“Skyharbour”), whereby Hatchet may acquire an 80% interest in Skyharbour’s 17,606 ha Highway Uranium Property (“Highway”) and a 100% interest, subject to a claw-back provision for Skyharbour, in Skyharbour’s Genie, Usam and CBX/Shoe Uranium Projects (the “Purchased Properties”) totalling 66,358 ha, all located to the northeast of the Athabasca Basin, northern Saskatchewan, Canada. The Agreement on Highway provides Hatchet an opportunity to earn an 80% interest in the related claims over a three-year period by fulfilling combined cash, share issuance and exploration expenditure commitments of CAD $3.345 million. Terms of Highway Property Agreement: Highway, now consists of nine (9) mineral claims comprising approximately 17,606 hectares, due to the recent addition of five (5) mineral claims comprising 8,267 ha. Hatchet may acquire an 80% interest in Highway by (i) issuing common shares in the capital of Hatchet (“Shares”) having an aggregate value of CAD $1,050,000; (ii) making aggregate cash payments of CAD $245,000; and (iii) incurring an aggregate of CAD $2,050,000 in exploration expenditures on Highway over a three-year period, as follows: (1) Deemed pricing of Shares is based on the twenty (20) day volume weighted average price on the stock exchange in which Hatchet shall list its Shares for trading, being either the TSX Venture Exchange or the Canadian Securities Exchange (“Deemed Price”) or the last sale price, if not listed on a stock exchange at the time of issuance. In the event that the issuance of any Shares pursuant to the above would result in Skyharbour holding 10% or more of the outstanding Shares of Hatchet, Hatchet will issue that number of Shares which would result in Skyharbour receiving 9.9% of the issued and outstanding Shares post-issuance and will pay cash in lieu of the Shares for the difference. Skyharbour shall retain a 2% net smelter returns royalty from minerals mined and removed from Highway, of which Hatchet may purchase one-half, being 1%, at any time for $1,000,000. Terms of the Purchased Properties: The Purchased Properties consists of twenty-five (25) mineral claims comprising approximately 66,358 hectares across the Genie, Usam and CBX/Show projects. Hatchet acquired a 100% interest in the Purchased Properties by, on the date of closing (the “Closing Date”), paying Skyharbour $25,000 and issuing to Skyharbour such number of units in the capital of Hatchet (“Hatchet Units”) equal to 9.9% of the issued and outstanding Shares immediately following issuance. Each Hatchet Unit shall be comprised of one Share and one share purchase warrant, entitling Skyharbour to purchase one additional Share for a period of three years at a price that is a 25% premium to the deemed value of the Shares in both years 1 and 2, and then increases to a 50% premium to the issuance value of the Shares in year 3. Skyharbour shall retain a claw-back provision whereby, within 90 days after the 3rd anniversary of the Closing Date, Skyharbour may elect by written notice to Hatchet of its intention to purchase back a twenty-five percent (25%) interest in the Purchased Properties by, within 90 days of delivery of such notice, incurring exploration expenditures or paying cash in lieu of to fund future exploration, equivalent to fifty percent (50%) of the total amount that Hatchet had spent during the term that is three years from the Closing Date in exploration expenditures on the Purchased Properties. If Hatchet has not incurred any exploration expenditures during the three years following the closing date, then Skyharbour shall automatically receive the 25% interest in the Purchased Properties. Skyharbour shall also retain a 2% net smelter returns royalty from minerals mined and removed from the Purchased Properties, of which Hatchet may purchase one-half, being 1%, at any time for $2,000,000. One of the conditions precedent for Hatchet prior to closing on both agreements was to close a financing for minimum gross proceeds of $1,500,000 which is now complete. Furthermore, Hatchet will proceed to list on the TSX Venture Exchange or the Canadian Securities Exchange or will have sold its interest to or combined with a similarly listed issuer. If this is not complete within 18 months, Hatchet’s right to acquire the Purchased Property will terminate. If after 12 months Hatchet has not listed then it shall pay Skyharbour a monthly fee of $10,000 until such conditions are satisfied or an aggregate of $60,000 has been paid, whichever occurs first. Highway Property Summary: The Highway Uranium Project consists of nice (9) claims covering 17,606 hectares, approximately 41 km south of the Rabbit Lake Mine and 11 km southwest of Uranium Energy Corp.’s (UEC, formerly UEX) West Bear U and Co-Ni Deposits. The Highway Project is located approximately 7 km east of the present-day margin of the Athabasca Basin but is believed to have been covered by Athabasca sandstone in the past. Highway 905 runs through the property, providing excellent access for exploration and in close proximity to regional infrastructure. There has been limited modern exploration performed on the project but there is the potential for high-grade basement-hosted-uranium mineralization. The project is underlain by Wollaston Supergroup metasedimentary gneisses (pelitic to psammopelitic and psammitic to meta-arkosic) folded around and overlying an Archean felsic gneiss dome which outcrops in the southwestern portion of the property and cores a northeast trending antiformal fold nose. Figure 1: Highway Property Location MapGenie Property Summary: The Genie property consists of five claims totalling 16,930 ha, and is located approximately 48 km northeast of Cameco’s Eagle Point Uranium Mine (Rabbit Lake Operation) and 40 km north of Wollaston Lake Post. The project is underlain by Wollaston Superground metasedimentary gneisses and Archean granitoids, with prospective pelitic to psammopelitic gneisses (including graphitic varieties) and several north-trending faults related to the Tabbernor fault system being mapped on the property. The project lies outside the current extent of the Athabasca Basin, but is believed to have been overlain by now-eroded Athabasca sandstones in the past and has the potential for high-grade basement-hosted uranium mineralization. The property is underlain by a series of linear magnetic highs (interpreted as granitoids) and magnetic lows (interpreted as metasedimentary gneisses), cross-cut by a highly magnetic northwest-trending Mackenzie Diabase dyke. Previous work on the Genie project includes limited diamond drilling (three historical drill holes, of which one was abandoned in overburden) and a variety of airborne and ground geophysical surveys, prospecting, geological mapping, lake sediment and overburden sampling, and soil sampling. Most of this exploration work took place between 1966 to 1980, prior to the advent of modern geophysical methods and geological models, but in 2014 part of the Genie property was covered by a helicopter-borne DIGHEM magnetic, electromagnetic, and radiometric survey. The survey showed a strong central EM conductor following a magnetically inferred contact on the two northeastern most claims, which is locally disrupted by several moderately conductive N-S trending structural breaks, inferred to be faults. This strong conductor is highly prospective for uranium mineralization, and drilling done in 1969 and 1971 has confirmed the presence of graphitic and sulfide-containing pelitic gneisses on the property. Lake sediment samples also collected at Genie during the 2014 exploration program, contained up to 63.3 ppm U, further showcasing the prospectivity of the property. Figure 2: Genie Property Location MapUsam Property Summary: The Usam Project consists of twelve claims totalling 40,041 ha and is located approximately 16 km northeast of Cameco’s Eagle Point Mine (Rabbit Lake Operation). The project has numerous EM conductors that are associated with significant magnetic lows of the Wollaston Domain. While the project is outside the current confines of the Athabasca Basin, the area was overlain by Athabasca sandstones historically. Basement rocks on the property include Wollaston Supergroup metasediments and Archean granitoid gneisses, with highly prospective pelitic to psammopelitic gneisses (including graphitic varieties) making up the largest proportion of the basement rocks. Several north-trending faults related to the Tabbernor fault system cross-cut the property. Previous work on the project includes diamond drilling (12 holes), lake sediment sampling, soil sampling, geological mapping, ground and airborne geophysics, marine seismic, prospecting, and other geochemical sampling, the majority of which was done in the 1980’s and 1970’s. Modern exploration of the property has been limited to geophysics and ground prospecting. As such there is a significant untested potential on the project. Trenching on Cleveland Island uncovered up to 0.31% U3O8 in mineralized pegmatite, and diamond drilling on Gilles Island intersected anomalous uranium, indicating that the basement rocks underling the Usam property are fertile sources of uranium in addition to containing pegmatite- and granite-hosted U-Th-REE mineralization. There are also several sedimentary-hosted base metals (i.e. Cu and Zn) showings on the project and in the surrounding area, which show similarities to the sedimentary-hosted Cu mineralization previously discovered by Rio Tinto and its partners at the Janice Lake Project further southwest in the Wollaston Domain. Figure 3 – Usam Property Location Map CBX/Shoe Property Summary: The CBX property has been recently expanded through staking to include five additional claims adjoining the previously staked CBX and Shoe properties, which have been combined to include a total of seven claims covering 8,777 hectares. The 609 ha Shoe property has remained unchanged, with both CBX and Shoe now consisting of eight non-contiguous claims totalling 9,386 hectares. The new claims lie approximately 6.5 km to 25 km northeast of the Eagle Point uranium mine and cover the northern shore of Wollaston Lake including parts of Cunning Bay. Outcrop exposure on the property is poor, but historical mapping and drilling shows that the newly expanded CBX project is underlain by a mixture of Wollaston Supergroup metasedimentary gneisses, Hudsonian intrusives, and Archean felsic gneisses of the Western Wollaston Domain. Similar lithologies host uranium mineralization at the Rabbit Lake operation, including the Eagle Point deposit, and other uranium deposits in the Athabasca Basin and surrounding regions. The CBX and Shoe properties have had historical exploration, including airborne and ground geophysical surveys, lake sediment, soil, and spruce geochemical surveys, till sampling, prospecting, geological mapping, and a marine seismic survey, but the majority of this work took place in the 1960’s to 1980’s, with limited modern exploration work being carried out on a small portion of the CBX and Shoe properties.

February 10, 2025 14:13 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=127887&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until March 25, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Title: Work at the Mill Or, the Story of Digital Equipment Corporation

Full Content:
Kenneth Harry Olsen was born on the 20th of February in 1926 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and he grew up in nearby Stratford. In the 1930s and 1940s when Olsen was a teenager, the electronics industry for the average person was essentially the radio industry. For Olsen, his window into that world was magazines, particularly Popular Mechanics and Popular Science. In the most common text books of the time, the topic stopped at the spark-gap transmitter, but Olsen was a voracious reader on the topic. He had a hungry mind, and he loved to experiment. Despite his lust for technology, he never had quite enough money to get the necessary components to satisfy his ambitions, but he worked with what he had. The greater Bridgeport area was a machine tool manufacturing hub, and most young men were somewhat expected to learn the trade and get some experience in the machine shops. Olsen definitely did so, but that work didn’t satisfy him and interest in electronics didn’t waiver. Like so many young men at that time, Olsen was drafted on account of the Second World War at the age of eighteen. He went into the US Navy with his Boot Camp at the Great Lakes. He then went to Chicago where he got an education in the electronics of the time, followed by still more education and training at Monterey in California, and then still more on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay. Olsen stated that all of the men in this program with him were rather excited and that they enjoyed the program. Nearly all of these young men were to be technicians on US Navy ships maintaining and repairing the new electronic systems being installed such as radar, radio, and even analogue computers for antisubmarine uses. The first part of his enlistment was spent sitting in camp, and then going on a troop ship. When the war came to its end, he was sent to China for a bit assigned to an admiral’s staff. He spent some time on a couple of cruisers maintaining communications for that admiral. He had the opportunity to see a bit of China and Korea, but there was quite a bit of time spent idle on the ship. During that time, he and some of the other sailors did some electronics experimentation, not all of which was exactly by the book. For example, they built a switching system for the radio that would automatically start a motor generator to allow them to send communications with higher power than would normally be available just so they needn’t wake any of the mechanical guys. Olsen left the Navy in 1946 and he enrolled at MIT in February of 1947 with several other veterans. He went for four terms without any vacation, and he was recruited to work at the MIT computer laboratory. Up to this point, Olsen had no concept of a computer at all just like most people on Earth. There, he worked on Whirlwind for the Office of Naval Research. His largest contribution to Whirlwind was the Memory Test Computer, which as the name would imply, tested the core memory of the Whirlwind computer (originally, Whirlwind used electrostatic memory tubes but was upgraded to core memory after Jay W. Forrester invented it {though magnetic core memory was invented by many people independently around the same time}). Whirlwind was a 2000 square feet monster weighing in at 20,000 pounds. It was comprised of 5000 vacuum tubes, had a 16bit word, and had the equivalent of 4KB of memory. This computer consumed more the 100kW. Olsen graduated with his BS in electrical engineering in 1950. Before enrolling in graduate school, Olsen took a summer off and traveled to Finland. His parents’ neighbor had had a Finnish girl, Eeva-Liisa Aulikki, who was a visiting student, stay with them. Olsen liked her and he failed in his initial pursuit. Yet, Olsen was a determined man. He got a job at a ball bearing factory in Goteberg. He courted her, he proposed, and she said yes. At the time, it wasn’t all that easy for a Finnish person to immigrate to the USA, and while Olsen now had a fiance, he couldn’t easily bring her to the States. He came back to school, and he visited her that following December. This time, he wasn’t leaving without his fiance. He stayed in Finland for six weeks. This put him behind in school, but he was able to keep his job and his enrollment. The two returned, and were married. Olsen completed his MS in electrical engineering in 1952, and he set about building a transistorized computer. While MIT approved the project, they didn’t make it easy for him. The school set the terms that he could hire approximately zero people and that he could have approximately zero space. Olsen considered these constraints seriously, but he then realized that these terms weren’t as rigid as one might assume. While he could hire no one, he could have people volunteer to help him, and while he couldn’t have space, he realized that hallways weren’t exactly counted as “space.” He and three others setup in the hall outside of his office and put a few walls around it. After a short time, they traded their makeshift area for a spot in the basement, and they then discovered that part of the Lincoln Laboratory’s basement was unfinished, just a bare dirt floor. Well, Olsen managed to convince someone to pour concrete, another someone to put in a light colored floor, and they painted the concrete masonry walls. They put in enough lighting to make their new location the brightest of any in the lab building. The computer that Olsen and his team built in that basement was the TX-0. It was far smaller than Whirlwind, and it was slightly faster. This machine used a vector display like its larger sibling, but it was a fully transistorized 18bit computer, had a 16bit address range for its core memory, and it could use a light pen. The TX-0 was finished in 1956. Almost immediately, work began on a much larger and more ambitious machine, the TX-2. Olsen was working on the hardware for that, but he became impatient with the team designing the logic. It was in 1957 that he chose to leave. He had some well reasoned confidence in his choice. Olsen wanted to start a company that sold small, transistorized, interactive computers. The TX-0 showed that interactive computing was more appealing to people than the prior batch paradigm. While people would queue for hours for time on the TX-0, they largely ignored the larger and more powerful machines that ran batch. Much of this is likely due to turn around time. Programming typically involves making quite a number of mistakes. With your typical IBM of the era, you’d bring your program in on a stack of cards, they’d be read, the program would be run, and you’d come by the next day to pickup the result. Given the likelihood of having made a mistake, it could take a week or two to get the intended results. With an interactive computer, the turn around was immediate. Olsen had the idea, and a colleague from MIT, Harlan Anderson, was with him. Right away, Ken Olsen’s brother, Stan, was brought in. Stan Olsen went about trying to secure some funding. This wasn’t easy. There was a bit of a recession setting in, and most major financial companies weren’t thrilled at the prospect of funding a computer startup. They eventually found out that American Research and Development Corporation was a company founded to do just this. AR&D was founded by General Georges Doriot and was one of the first venture capital firms. They’d had some of their other computer investments fail, and even they, who opened shop for this express purpose, weren’t too excited. They were willing to invest, but they had some advice. First, they suggested that the new company drop the “computer” from Digital Computer Corporation, and so the company name became Digital Equipment Corporation. Second, they advised that the group change their expected profit. The three had started with an estimate of 5% but they bumped that to 10%. Finally, AR&D suggested that they aim to have an extremely quick return, and so DEC promised results in a year. AR&D was a bit unusual, but they fit DEC extremely well. They believed (or at least Doriot did) that investments should be long-term, not just buying and selling at the first opportunity for profit. They’d stick it out until the company was successful or until the company failed. Essentially, AR&D was patient, and they believed in really giving it a go with their investments, and Doriot would mentor companies when such was desired. The company planned to sell circuit modules before attempting to sell complete computers, and Olsen had largely worked out the technological side of that. The real first step then was to create the financial plan for the company. Olsen and Anderson did so, and they presented that plan to AR&D who provided them with $70,000 which would be around $786,000 in 2025 dollars. With that money, the infant DEC of three men bought the equipment they would need, made some silk screens, etched boards and dipped them in solder. Everything. They were extremely careful with their money, and they learned quite a bit. While they did learn how to handle accounting and business operations, they chose to spend some of their limited funds on secretaries, accountants, and other supporting roles. The company setup their company in the old Assbet Woolen Company’s mill in downtown Maynard, Massachusetts. As the company grew, they took over all nineteen buildings on the site, and the company purchased the building in 1974 for $2.2 million. In 1958, DEC released the Digital Laboratory Module line. These were essentially printed circuit boards in extruded aluminum housings with germanium transistors mounted to them. These were circuits based on those that had been used in the TX-2. While the intent was to have these on an engineer’s workbench, Digital also offered a rack-mount case that would hold nine modules. Versions of these were made running at different speeds: 500kHz, 2MHz, 10MHz. In the first year, the company had $94,000 in revenue from module sales which would be roughly equivalent to $1,055,000 in 2025 dollars. The company made good on its promise to post profits in a year. These modules were then used by DEC itself to build whole machines. The first of these was a memory test machine. Yet, this wasn’t what brought the company its first hit. That honor goes to the Programmed Data Processor-1 or PDP-1. Of this machine, Ken Olsen said: The goal of the PDP-1 was to introduce a new type computer to the world. In the tradition that was developed at MIT where the computer was very simple, very fast, relatively inexpensive. In this case, $110,000 with only 4000 words of memory. Because it was simple, easy to use, interactive with the cathode ray tube and light pen, it could be used by an individual. Someone could afford to sit there and use the computer like we do a personal computer today. You could also use the same equipment interactively with equipment, that is, with a machine or a telephone system because the price was relatively low. $110,000 thirty years ago was a lot of money, but computers then cost one, two and three million dollars, so it was relatively inexpensive. And it did open up new applications that people hadn't thought of before. The PDP-1 was built of DEC modules, and it was based directly upon the TX-0 and TX-2. The design was extremely simple, it was easy to use, and it was interactive. As for technical specifications, it was built of 2700 transistors and 3000 diodes. While the transistors could switch at roughly 5MHz the actual CPU speed was about 187kHz which resulted in most instructions completing in around 10.7 microseconds. This means the PDP-1 could manage around 93,458 operations per second though for simple additions this could be up to 100,000. The machine shipped with 4K words (18bit) of memory standard which would be equivalent to 9.2KB, but could be upgraded to 65,536 words. Setting the PDP-1 apart from pretty much all other computers of its day were lack of need for special power considerations, subflooring, air conditioning, and other accommodations. Interestingly, the temperature of the PDP-1 was controlled by the computer itself to maintain a temperature of between 50 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit. The system shipped in four cabinets and occupied a total of 17 square feet of space. It weighed in at about 1600 pounds. Standard equipment was a PDP-1 with 4K words RAM, a paper tape reader, a typewriter with on-line input and output, and a paper tape punch. Optionally, the customer could purchase a CRT, a light pen, card punch and card reader, tape drives and tape controllers, more memory, and multiply/divide accelerator cards. The math accelerators would have been absolutely essential for many customers when one considers that the average time for a division without an accelerator was about 600 microseconds. As you can likely infer, storage was primarily on paper tape. For “finished” results the paper tape output could be taken to a Flexowriter for offline printing. DECtape drives were available by the time the first PDP-1 was formally accepted, and some PDP-1 installations added these. The first delivery of a PDP-1 was to Bolt, Beranek and Newman in November of 1960 with formal acceptance in 1961 (at latest by April). BBN’s PDP-1 was then used for research projects that they undertook for both government and private industry. A total of 53 PDP-1 systems are known to have been delivered but 55 were made, and one of those was a donation to MIT. The PDP-1 is among the most important computers to have ever been made. It was the birthplace of the text editor, word processor, interactive debugger, computer chess, Spacewar!, and while not the first, it was the birth place of what was certainly among the earliest time sharing systems (BBN TS). Even music was made with the PDP-1. Using four flip-flops controlled directly by the PDP-1’s processor, the PDP-1 could play music in four-part harmony prepared by Peter Samson’s Harmony Compiler. It was with the PDP-1 that hacker culture truly started (though the TX-0 and TX-2 were the most absolute origin). Yet, even that doesn’t fully describe the importance of the PDP-1. It was the first commercial computer that emphasized user interaction over the efficient use of computer cycles. In this sense, the PDP-1 was the first personal computer. Naturally, due to the price tag, there were likely zero PDP-1s bought explicitly for use by a single person, but it brought about that model of use. Emphasizing this, we again have the words of Ken Olsen: … we believed computers should be fun. They were exciting. They could do so many things. The opportunities were just without bounds. In 1960, DEC had around 117 employees, and they finished the year with $1.3 million in revenue. In 1962, DEC introduced the PDP-4. For the most part, the PDP-4 was a smaller and cheaper version of the PDP-1. Primarily, the PDP-4 used slower memory, was priced at $65,000, and weighed in at 1090 pounds. Over time, DEC sold 54 PDP-4s. With the PDP-1 and PDP-4 on the market, the company’s profits for 1962 were $807,000 on sales of $6.5 million. Some may wonder what happened to PDP-2 and PDP-3. The PDP-2 was designed as a 24bit machine, but the design was never completed. The PDP-3 was a 36bit machine, and only one was ever made as far as I can tell and then not by DEC. The lone PDP-3 was built in 1960 at CIA’s Scientific Engineering Institute in Waltham, Massachusetts, and it was called CASINO (Computer Able to Select INternal Orders). In From RAINBOW to GUSTO by Paul A. Suhler, I found the following: As the amount of radar testing at the Ranch increased, the scientists at SEI decided that the data had become too much to process by hand. To speed things up, they decided that a computer would be needed. The difficulty was that no computer within their budget was available off the shelf. So they decided to build their own. In October 1960, the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) had produced a specification for the PDP-3, a new system in their line of programmable data processor minicomputers. Ed Rawson took charge of the project and with the help of Chuck Corderman and Jay Lawson designed and built a PDP-3 using standard DEC logic modules. Because disk drives were not available, a tape loop running through an Ampex tape drive held intermediate results; eventually, the tape loop was replaced with a drum memory. The project was run like a homebrew computer project, with more emphasis on getting the machine and software to run rather than on making it well documented and easy to use. The design evolved so rapidly that when one of the engineers returned after a two-week absence, he didn’t recognize it. The design evolved away from the original PDP-3 architecture, and it came to be called CASINO. Eventually the system worked. Radar data were recorded by EG&G at the Ranch on 1 inch wide data tapes and shipped to SEI. The data could be processed correctly, but the computer could usually only be operated with Rawson looking over the user’s shoulder. Eventually, the PDP-3 was discarded; one computer engineering textbook stated that in the early 1980s it was running somewhere in Washington state, but the author of that book could not confirm it. There is an unconfirmed report that it was donated to a Boy Scout troop and eventually given to Dow Chemical for disposal. It was the only example of a PDP-3 ever built. DEC themselves lacked the resources to build the PDP-3, and the one customer who actually bought one was the Air Force’s Cambridge Research Laboratory. DEC arranged to provide them with two PDP-1s instead. In the early 1960s, DEC was approached by Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories in Canada. The lab asked DEC to bid on a special purpose computer, but DEC responded with the offer to build an extremely simple general purpose computer that could accomplish the goals they had in mind. This was the impetus for the PDP-5, and its design was based on the LINC from from MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory. This machine was quite different from DEC’s prior computers. It had 12bit words, a maximum of 32,768 words of memory, and just eight instructions. With so few instructions, just 3 bits of a word were used for op-codes. In its base configuration (with just 1024 words of memory), the PDP-5 was a single cabinet, nineteen inches wide, with 150 printed circuit boards each containing over 900 transistors. It weighed in at 540 pounds. The PDP-5 was first shown to the public on the 11th of August in 1963 at WESCON. Pricing for the PDP-5 started at just $27,000, and DEC produced over 100 of them. For 1963, DEC made a profit of $1,180,197 on revenues of $9,906,968. The PDP-6, released in 1964, was Digital’s first large computer. This machine used a 36bit word just like the big machines from IBM, and unlike most big machines of that era, it had a time sharing system as standard. The PDP-6 did, however, retain 18bit addressing meaning that machine was limited to the equivalent about 1MB of RAM which was implemented using magnetic cores. The exceptions to core memory were the processor registers which were implemented with transistors. The base model was configured with 32,768 words of memory, equivalent to about 144K. The advantage of the 36bit nature of the machine is most readily seen in two 18bit addresses being stored in a single memory location, meaning that two 18bit addresses could be read and written with a single operation. The typical PDP-6 weighed between 1300 and 1700 pounds, and pricing ranged from $120,000 to $300,000. In the highest end configuration, a PDP-6 would have had both a disk drive and several tape drives. With dual DECtape drives, a PDP-6 could support around four users, and with a disk drive one could support around twenty users. Given the expensive price, not many were sold (just 23). Despite the low sales volume, the PDP-6 was one of the most important computers for the history of the industry due to its software. The PDP-6 shipped with an operating system called PDP-6 Monitor that would become TOPS-10 with version 5.01 in 1970. It is from TOPS-10’s command line interface that the design for Gary Kildall’s CP/M would emerge; a legacy that continues with Windows’ use of / for switches and thus \ for paths. If that isn’t enough, it is also on the PDP-6 that MIT’s Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS) would begin its life. Another development in 1964, DEC began redesigning their machines with Flip-Chip modules. These Flip-Chips were the replacement for their previous System Modules, and they cost less. The first versions were four inches long and two and half inches wide. These Flip-Chips allowed system designers to work at a higher level than discrete transistors or diodes (think gates). Over time, these came in varying sizes, used ICs instead of individual transistors, and saw price reductions. The first Flip-Chips had a cost between $350 and $750 in series A (DACs, amplifiers, etc), and a cost between $15 and $57 for series B (logic). The first system to be redesigned was the PDP-4 which was introduced as the PDP-7 in December of 1964 at a price of $72,000. Digital produced something around 120 PDP-7s over time, and this was the machine on which UNIX was written. Memory cycles for this machine were just 1.75µs, and addition took just for 4µs. An original PDP-7 weighed in at 1100 pounds. Units began shipping in November of 1964. Success forced some changes at DEC. Initially, the company didn’t hire folks formally trained or educated in computing, and it didn’t have much structure. Partially, there just weren’t a ton of people with experience in the field, but also the company didn’t have a ton of money. Then, there’s the fact that given the simplicity of DEC’s earliest hardware, there wasn’t much need for incredibly experienced people. So long as a person were generally bright, he/she could be trained on the machines quickly. The earliest hardware was simple enough to be thoroughly understood by a single person, and often with little need for any kind of reference once that understanding were gained. Once the company was successful, they had the money to hire the best and brightest minds in the industry, and they did. By this point, DEC’s reputation for excellence, outstanding value per dollar, and customer focus was building if not firmly established. That DEC would listen to customer needs and tailor machines to those needs was part of that reputation. Yet, internally, DEC was also innovating. In 1964, the company had a bit of a crisis. With large amounts of growth both internally and externally, the various parts of the company weren’t working well together and this led to shipment delays. Profits for 1964 dropped to $900,000 on revenues of $10,909,565. Olsen then restructured the company to have a team of product line managers. Each product line manager was essentially running a company within a company and competed against the others (usually in a friendly manner). Each manager was expected to take full responsibility for the product line under his/her supervision. For non-managerial employees and managers alike, they were encouraged to innovate, encouraged to challenge quotidian ideas, and they were encouraged to keep quality at the center of their work. Unlike most companies of that time, DEC also embraced diversity. People who previously weren’t exactly welcomed in the industry found their places at DEC. The company hired people of all races, both male and female, and even those with learning disabilities. Many DEC employees have stated that their time at Digital was their best experience in the industry. With the versatility, low price, and ease of use offered by DEC’s computers, the company would often sell their machines without any visible branding to other computer vendors such as Intersil. Those company may make some changes or additions and then sell them as their own. The company also sold tape drives, disk drives, terminals, and other peripherals to OEMs, and this had the weird result of DEC at one time being both the largest purchaser of disk drives and the largest seller of disk drives. The second system to get the Flip-Chip treatment was the PDP-5, which was introduced to the world as the PDP-8 on the 22nd of March in 1965 at a price of $18,500. For that price, a customer received a machine capable of 333,000 instructions per second. Over 50,000 PDP-8s were sold, and this is likely due to the simplicity of the instruction set as well as being the first computer available for less than $20,000. As the machine got revisions, that price eventually fell to just $8000. Getting the system built in high volumes at a low cost took some work. DEC studied household appliances and automobiles to get ideas, and Olsen himself went to discount stores and spent hours studying washing machines, dryers, and stoves. In particular, the switch handle idea came from a Maytag dryer and slip-on connectors came from automobiles. The PDP-9 was released in 1966. This was another 18bit machine, and it was capable of roughly double the performance of the PDP-7. This was the first DEC machine to make extensive use of microcode which was implemented in read-only core memory. Microinstructions in the PDP-9 were 36bits wide. This machine had many hardware options among which were multiply/divide, shifting, memory extension control (which provided bank switching), memory management (including a register to set the boundary between protected and un-protected memory), and a DMA controller. It weighed in at 750 pounds, and most installations would have had a paper tape reader, paper tape punch, DECtape for the OS and data storage, and a console teleprinter. Of course, DECtape was not in the base configuration, and other optional peripherals included drum memory, disk, and CRT. The PDP-9 outsold the PDP-7 by quite a margin with 445 units having made it into customer locations. The LINC-8 was first made in 1966 as well, and it was weird. This machine contained both a PDP-8 processor and a LINC processor. While these could not be run simultaneously, one could switch between LINC mode and PDP-8 mode. When the machine was in PDP-8 mode, the LINC processor was halted until the PDP-8 processor wanted something to be handled by the LINC processor. At that point, an interrupt switched the machine to LINC mode to perform the desired action. The reasons for this setup were several; all of the interrupts for either mode were handled exclusively by the PDP-8 processor, the LINC processor provided DMA to the PDP-8 processor, and the processors were extremely different. The LINC is 12bit one’s complement, and the PDP-8 12bit two’s complement. In 1967, the PDP-10 (also known as the DECsystem-10) made it to market running TOPS-10. This was the successor to the PDP-6 and as such was a 36bit machine capable of running programs for the PDP-6. It was capable of the twice the performance of the 6, and it could handle timesharing, batch, and real-time operation. In the final years, PDP-10s were sold as DECSYSTEM-20 and ran TOPS-20. Of course, some of these would run ITS (at MIT), TENEX (at BBN), the CompuServe time-sharing system (CompuServe had some PDP-10s operating until at least 2007), and WAITS (at Stanford) depending upon where they were installed. The PDP-10 sold far better than the 6 and could be found at Universities and research institutions around the world with something like 1500 having been sold. While early PDP-10s were made with Flip-Chips, later models were made with ECL, and still later with TTL and the Am2901. Being both relatively inexpensive and rather powerful, these machines were used extensively in building the early ARPANET. Other notable parts of this machine’s legacy are seen in its use to write Adventure by Will Crowther, Empire by Walter Bright, and Zork by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling. Of course, there’s also Altair BASIC written by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on a PDP-10 at Harvard. As of 1968, DEC had grown to 2600 employees, had $57,339,400 in revenue, $6,856,690 in profits, and $36,496,876 in assets. Both revenues and employees would nearly double in 1969. The PDP-12 was released in 1969 as the successor to the LINC-8. It weighed in at 600 pounds. It sold decently for a laboratory specific machine with 725 units total being sold over its lifetime. The machine shipped with OS/12 based upon OS/8, and it also shipped with software for data acquisition, mass spectrometry, Fourier analysis, storage management, support for several different peripheral devices, and display. The PDP-12 was shipped with two LINCtape drives, a display, and I/O ports for laboratory equipment interface. Purchasers of a PDP-12 could also take advantage of a two week programming course at DEC’s mill in Maynard, or other sites in Palo Alto, Reading in the UK, Cologne in Germany, or Paris in France. Just as the PDP-12 was a laboratory machine, DEC released the PDP-14 for industrial controls. While it was essentially a programmable logic controller, it could interface with a PDP-8. It was 12bit with 4K words of memory, and the processor had seven 12bit registers. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, DEC’s growth in the market led to some changes. The company began placing manufacturing plants in urban areas and hiring and training local residents. The company expanded manufacturing to Ireland in 1971 and costs were reduced in 1973 when Ireland was admitted to the European Common Market. The PDP-11 had been formally specified by January of 1969. It was a 16bit machine with base RAM of 4K and prices starting at $10,800. It had no dedicated input or output instructions, nor did it have load or store. Instead, the PDP-11 used the move instruction for these purposes. This quirk combined with memory mapped I/O means that data could be moved directly from input device to an output device, or to memory, or to a register. At this machine’s beginning, core memory was used, and by its end, microprocessors and DRAM were standards. The first model released was the PDP-11/20. This machine was implemented with TTL on quad-width, extended length cards (though a few dual width, standard length cards were used as well). It was the first DEC machine to implement the UNIBUS connecting the processor, memory, and peripheral devices (though this was supplanted by the QBUS in later models). This first PDP-11 was the only one in the line to utilize discrete logic rather than microcode. The first 11/20 shipped in June of 1970. It was limited to one-bit shift operations, lacked hardware support for multiplication and division, and didn’t have hardware floating point. If one wanted such capabilities, they were available with the optional Extended Arithmetic Element which would attach to the UNIBUS. The PDP-11 line gained 18bit addressing in 1973 with the 11/40 and 11/45, and 22bit addressing with the 11/70 in 1975. The 11/70 was similar to the 11/45 but with its 22bit addressing could support more memory (up to 4MB). It also had a 2KB cache, and support for high speed storage. AT&T bought quite a number of 11/70s and became DEC’s single largest customer for some time. The PDP-11’s processor was implemented in LSI in the autumn of 1975 as the LSI-11 (four chips), and brought the QBUS with it. This shipped in the PDP-11/03. The very last non-LSI model was the 11/44 in 1979, while the 11/23 of 1979 was the first to use the F-11 which was the second LSI version of the PDP-11’s processor. It was implemented in two chips on one DIP. This included memory management and floating point. The F-11 was superseded by the J-11, a high-performance, CMOS, PDP-11 CPU in two chips on a single DIP. This could optionally be used with the FPJ11 floating point unit and an external cache. The F-11 debuted with the 11/73 and it was clocked at 15MHz. The final PDP-11 models were the 11/93 and the 11/94 in 1990. These were both 22bit machines clocked at 18MHz. The 11/93 used the QBUS and the 11/94 used the UNIBUS. Many different operating systems were available for the PDP-11. From DEC, one could get DOS-11, RSX-11 (real-time, heavily influenced VMS), RSTS/E (time sharing, descendant of RSTS-11, written in BASIC, could execute BASIC or programs [and their environments] written in other languages), RT-11 (somewhat similar to OS/8), or IAS (Interactive Application System, could be time-sharing, multi-user [time-sharing without protection], or real-time; based on RSX-11). Yet, the PDP-11 also had UNIX (first through seventh editions), System III, 2.9 BSD, 2.10 BSD, 2.11 BSD, and many more. A bit more than 600,000 PDP-11s were sold over the machine’s production lifetime. The PDP-11 became, as Olsen described it, a corporate strategy. While they still had their larger machine with the PDP-10, special purpose machines for industrial and research applications, the company’s focus was primarily on the PDP-11. With the PDP-11 on the market, revenues for 1970 hit $135,408,000, income hit $14,400,000, and the employee count reached 5800. The final 18bit machine from DEC was the PDP-15, the successor of the PDP-9. This was the only 18bit machine from DEC to be implemented entirely in TTL, and it shipped with 4K words of memory in the base model 15/10 or with 24K words and two disks in the 15/40. Memory addressing for the PDP-15 was 17bits. It had options for multiply/divide and floating point, with multiply/divide being standard on all models except the base model 15/10. It had memory management with protected and un-protected modes. As with all other DEC machines, there were many peripherals available. The first PDP-15 was delivered in December of 1970, and it would go on to sell roughly 790 units until its discontinuation in 1979. DEC released the VT05 computer terminal in 1970 made with discrete logic. It could display upper-case ASCII at 72 columns and 20 rows, with forward scrolling, and with direct cursor addressing. While this sounds extremely limited (and it was), it was decently speedy at 110 to 2400 baud, and it could accept video input and display it beside text. In 1974, the VT05 was replaced by the VT50, which was itself replaced the following year with the VT52. The VT50 could handle 80 columns and 12, and the VT52 doubled the number of rows to 24. The VT52 also added support for all of the ASCII character set, and it included 32 graphics characters. It had bidirectional scrolling. The VT52’s logic was made with ICs as opposed to discrete logic, and it had far faster communication at up to 9600 baud. DEC entered the Fortune 500 in 1974. In 1975, DEC began work on its successor the PDP-11. Though, this wasn’t a simple redesign effort like previous successor machines. This was a 32bit machine, Star, with a new operating system, Starlet, and it was cluster friendly. The architecture of this new computer was designed by Bill Strecker. This was the VAX (Virtual Address eXtension), and its OS was VMS designed (mostly) by Dave Cutler who’d joined DEC in 1971 at the mill in Maynard. Cutler had worked on RSX-11M for the PDP-11 released November of 1974, and as such, he was a natural fit for this effort. The project leader for VMS was Roger Gourd, and Cutler worked with Dick Hustvedt and Peter Lipman. These projects culminated in their announcement in October of 1977 as the VAX-11/780 and VMS. The processor of the 11/780 was made of TTL, ran at around 5MHz, and could achieve 1 MIPS (million instructions per second). It had a 2K cache. Microcode for the system was loaded at boot from an eight inch floppy disk connected to a PDP-11/03 that also handled both local and remote diagnostics. At launch, the system could have up to 8MB of ECC RAM, but this was later expanded to 128MB. Keeping compatibility with the prior hardware ecosystem, the VAX 11/780 used the Unibus for attaching lower speed peripherals, but to take advantage of the newer architecture it had the Massbus for high speed disk and tape drives. For the clustering feature of the VAX superminicomputer, there was the Computer Interconnect. This was a proprietary network allowing both disk sharing as well as the standup of VMSclusters (originally VAXcluster). Each machine ran its own copy of VMS, but the disk storage, lock manager, and security domain were shared among all cluster members. For proper high availability, any one node in the cluster could fail while the rest were unaffected. VMSclusters weren’t ready until May of 1983, but the feature was planned and its support present in hardware with this original VAX. The VAXen could also support the older DecNet protocol originally found on the PDP-11, and the early VAXen could run user-mode RSX-11M software from the PDP-11 via the RSX Application Migration Executive. This later became an optional add-on with VAX/VMS 4.0 called VAX-11 RSX. VMS has a three layer design. At the bottom there’s the privileged Executive, in the middle there’s the Command Language Interpreter, and at the top there’s the unprivileged utilities and run-time libraries. All unprivileged code accessed functionality of the executive through system services which would be equivalent to system calls in UNIX/Linux. These layers are well fitted to the VAX architecture, and on non-VAX hardware the needed mechanisms were emulated when not present. One absolutely astounding feature of VMS was that its first release had no known bugs. Given the system that the 11/780 was intended to replace, it will surprise approximately zero people to learn that Unix/32V, Ultrix, NetBSD, and OpenBSD were ported to the architecture in short order. Additionally, many different programming languages became available for VAX/VMS quite quickly including Fortran-77, COBOL, Bliss-32, PL/I, BASIC, PASCAL, LISP, C, and many more over the VAX’s lifetime. DEC released the VT100 terminal in August 1978. This terminal was built around an Intel 8080, had 3K RAM, 8K ROM, was capable of 80 columns by 24 rows or 132 by 14, had an 83-key detachable keyboard, bidirectional scrolling, and could support baud rates from 50 to 19,200. This terminal also supported text attributes like blink, bold, and underline. The 100 was followed by more in the line that were either cost reduced or upgraded. Of these, the VT103 was the most interesting. With newer hardware allowing the internals to be reduced in physical size, there was quite a bit of room in the casing. The VT103 used this space to add an 8-slot QBUS backplane and card cage. This allowed the owner to add a small, 16bit, LSI-11 microcomputer with optional DECtape II block-addressable cartridge tape drive to the system. The VT180 took this one step further in 1982 by added a complete 2MHz Z80, 64K RAM, two external 5.25 inch floppy disk drives, and CP/M. DEC’s terminals combined with DECwriter printers helped to make Digital one of the leading peripheral vendors in the industry. The VT100 line of terminals was extremely successful and live on in many terminal emulators today. In October of 1979, DEC opened a new factory in Westminster, thirty miles West of Maynard. The company started transferring workers to this location, and many of them complained about their inability to secure a mortgage from banks in that area. This got back to Ken Olsen who then began discussing the problem with the human resources department. This resulted in the creation of the Digital Federal Credit Union, or DCU, which charged less than the going rate for home loans and payed better interest on savings. This is a strategy that former tenant of the mill in Maynard had used for their employees back in the 1800s when the area had no bank. In 1980, Digital released the VAX-11/750. This was essentially an LSI VAX, and it was available as a rackmount unit, the 11/751. This was fully compatible with the 780 in every way. It could even boot the same disk pack. The primary downside was that it was slightly slower than its predecessor. This was followed in 1982 by the VAX-11/730. This was an even smaller version built using AM2900s. In its base configuration it included an internal disk controller, and it had two tape drives in the chassis for loading microcode. For disk drives, the machine could use an RA60 (205MB removable disk pack) or an RA81 456MB fourteen inch winchester drive. Like the other VAXen, it supported VMSclusters. Still, the target market was small offices, and this really showed with an included calendar, mail client, and wordprocessor. Cutler moved to DEC West in 1981 where he worked on the PRISM project to build a 32bit RISC ISA. In particular, he worked on MICA which was to be the OS for PRISM. This OS was unique in that it required compatibility with both VMS and UNIX, and the hope was to unify DEC’s ULTRIX (a UNIX system), and VMS. PRISM, and MICA with it, was canceled in 1988. By this time, DEC was the second largest computer company after IBM, and IBM had released the PC. While DEC had already ventured into the microcomputer space with their terminals, the company had something else they’d been developing, the Rainbow 100. This computer was first shown at the National Computer Conference in Houston in June of 1982. It contained both a Z80 and an Intel 8088 along with 64K RAM (expandable to 896K). It could use either CPU and then have the other provide some extra functions. For example the Z80 supported the floppy drive, while the 8088 handled video, keyboard, printer, and other peripherals. With those two CPUs, owners of the Rainbow 100 could run either CP/M or MS-DOS (or CP/M-86), but as the “100” implies, this machine could also act as a terminal. If equipped with the NEC-7220 graphics chip the Rainbow 100 could output a resolution up to 800 by 240 with four colors from a palette of 4096. The included floppy disk drive (the RX50) could read and write single-sided 5.25 inch floppies of 409KB. The drive could hold two disks simultaneously but could only access one at a time as the two heads were controlled by a single motor. A floppy in the top slot was inserted face-up, while a floppy in the lower slot was inserted face down. If one opted for the hard disk, it was a winchester style MFM ST-506 compatible drive of either 5MB or 10MB. Other options were a memory expansion, and communications. All Rainbow 100s had serial and parallel; they could display 80 columns by 24 rows or 132 columns by 24 rows, and they shipped with Microsoft BASIC and WordStar. Several other operating systems were ported to the system including UCSD p-System, Concurrent CP/M, VENIX, and QNX. Third party upgrades were available including an 80286 CPU upgrade, a 3.5 inch floppy drive, a clock chip with battery backup, a Navajo language ROM, memory expansions, hard disk controllers, LAN adapters, SCSI adapters, tape drives, and more. While the Rainbow 100 was initially moderately successful, the IBM PC was outselling it by quite a margin. Part of this was the Rainbow 100’s high price at $3245, but there are two far more glaring problems. First, the Rainbow 100 could run MS-DOS but it wasn’t fully compatible with the IBM PC. As a result, an owner might purchase a software package and come home only to find that it wouldn’t run. Second, the Rainbow 100 didn’t include an ISA bus. This made peripheral adapters and other expansion cards far less numerous and far more expensive. In 1983, DEC released the VAX-11/725 which was a repackaged 11/730 with an RC25 disk drive for storage. Alongside this, they released the full feature VAXcluster software and revision to DECnet supporting more than 1000 nodes. The bigger product of the year (in my opinion) was the VT200 series of terminals with the base model being the VT220. The initial price of the VT220 was $1295, and this would get a buyer a terminal based around the Intel 8051 microcontroller, 16K RAM, 24K ROM, 256 bytes of NVRAM. While the entire 200 line was compatible with the VT100, it added internationalization, and the ability to alter the character set. The VT240 added graphics support, and the VT241 added color graphics support. The VT200 series sold well and was extremely influential. The keyboard inspired the IBM Model M’s layout, and many virtual terminal emulators today are made to compatible with the VT200 series. In 1984, DEC brought several different products to market. The first of these was the VAX-11/785 which updated the 780 with modern components and roughly doubled the performance of the machine. The second was the MicroVAX I (code name Seahorse). This was the first computer DEC built with VLSI. The CPU module was made with two chips, the ALU and FPU, while the rest of the chip was made with TTL logic. This machine also implemented the QBUS between the processor and main memory. The MicroVAX I was the slowest VAX ever made. The third product released in 1984 was the VAXstation. This was a graphical workstation built with the MicroVAX I CPU clocked at 4MHz. The original VAXstation ran a proprietary GUI system on VMS that was called the VMS Workstation Software (VWS). The fourth product that year were the VAX-11/784 which was a 780 with four processors. Only four or five of these were made. The fifth that year was ULTRIX-32. This was DEC’s UNIX variant based on 4.2 BSD ported to the 32bit VAX platform. The sixth product of the year was DEC’s Rdb, a relational database management system for VMS. The seventh and final product of 1984 was the VAX 8600 (code name Venus) which was introduced on the 31st of October with shipments starting in March of 1985. The 8600 was the best selling VAX system after it launched. Its processor was clocked at 12.5MHz and implemented in ECL with a 16K cache. Memory was error corrected and could be expanded to 512MB (though the 8600 officially only supported up to 368MB). In 1985, VAX evolution certainly continued with the release of the MicroVAX II and MicroVAX II GPX. The MicroVAX II was a strong improvement over the MicroVAX bringing the system more in line with the original VAX’s performance. The GPX brought graphics support to MicroVAX II. These were also available for standard nineteen inch racks. In 1986, DEC introduced the VAX 8800 family of systems that built upon the success of the 8600. The high-end model was the 8800 with two processors and the VAXBI bus. The CPU was redesigned to be pipelined and support full SMP. There were several lower tier models like the 8700 which had just a single processor, the 8550 which was an 8700 without upgrade capability, and the 8550 which had lower performance. More SKUs in this line launched over time with updated processors in a variety of combinations, and some that were sold as clusters. In September of 1986, the VAXmate was made available. This was an IBM PC/AT compatible machine and was a replacement of the Rainbow 100. Driving this machine was an Intel 80286 CPU clocked at 8MHz, 1MB of RAM, a 1.2MB 5.25 inch floppy disk drive, and thinwire ethernet interface. The machine had the monitor integrated with chassis though it doesn’t give that look, and that monitor was a 14inch CRT of either amber or green phosphor. The VAXmate had an optional expansion box that featured ISA expansion slots and a hard disk of either 20MB or 40MB. While the VAXmate naturally ran MS-DOS, its DOS could be served from a VAX running VMS with network boot. As an interesting bit of information, the software supplied came on three disks with a virtual terminal that was compatible with the VT240, a copy of Windows 1.03, a copy of MS-DOS 3, some applications, and some fonts. While this machine was essentially an IBM AT clone, it wasn’t intended to be used as such. The true intent was for the VAXmate to serve as a terminal for a VAX system such as the MicroVAX II. When being used in this manner, the primary disk was in RAM, and the network drives of the VAX would be seen (usually) as drives starting with H and iterating down the alphabet. These logical drives were actually just subdirectories on the VAX, and this brought about some incompatibility with standard DOS tools like CHKDSK, DISKCOPY, JOIN, LABEL, RECOVER, SUBST, and SYS, but I imagine that this could have had wider implications. The issue here is that these weren’t real drives so attempting to address an absolute sector location would fail. While there were updates to both the MicroVAX and the VAX 8800 line in 1987, the big news that year was the VAXstation 2000 which was essentially a MicroVAX 2000 in a workstation configuration with graphics. It featured a MicroVAX II processor with no cache, up to 14MB of RAM, no expansion bus, but could be fitted with both a floppy drive and a hard disk. It supported VMS and ULTRIX. It was durable, it was popular, and it was reliable. The key thing to note was that this was a response to the rising popularity of UNIX workstations from the likes of Sun Microsystems and Silicon Graphics that were beginning to gain popularity at this time. The 2000 came first, and the 3000 line followed with faster processors, more memory, and more cache. The line didn’t end until a few years after the demise of DEC. At that time, the descendants of the 3000 line (including the 4000 and the 8000) could be had with an NVAX CPU (a CMOS implementation of the VAX processor, 0.75μm, three layers of aluminum interconnect, die size of 16.2 by 14.6 mm) that could be clocked as high as 170.9MHz. In 1988, following the cancellation of PRISM, Cutler began thinking about striking out on his own, but Bill Gates called to recruit Cutler and several others. This group met with Steve Ballmer shortly thereafter. According to Cutler, they quit DEC on Friday and joined Microsoft on Monday. At Microsoft, Cutler and his team built “WNT” (increment each letter by one from VMS), and the similarities between VMS and NT are unmistakable. The VMS Interrupt Priority Level became the Interrupt Request Level, the Asynchronous System Trap became the Asynchronous Procedure Call, a Fork Procedure became a Deferred Procedure Call, while some other terminology was copied verbatim. NT and VMS share similarities in many ways, but unlike VMS, NT processes can contain more than one thread of execution, NT uses access control lists for object security, NT uses its own NTFS, and NT uses the registry (a centralized hierarchical configuration database) allowing the configuration of computers over a network, among many other major differences some of which are ideas Cutler had thought about while working on MICA. When Microsoft released Windows NT, these similarities were noticed. Digital Equipment Corporation threatened litigation against Microsoft over those similarities, and the matter was settled out of court for something around $50 million (around $106 million in 2023) in August of 1995. Additionally, a rather broad alliance between the two companies was formed. Microsoft was obligated to train 1500 DEC employees from DEC’s large services division at no cost to DEC as certified NT engineers, which was more NT engineers than Microsoft itself had at the time. Additionally, Microsoft would build and maintain the Alpha port of Windows NT. As a result of these two things, DEC’s revenues on NT systems would reach roughly $450 million by 1997, and VMS customers were migrated to NT. In 1989, the very last non-microprocessor-based VAX was released, the VAX 9000. It was a true mainframe in all respects. It was fast using ECL, drank electricity as if it were free, generated enough heat to make the devil feel at home, and could hit 125 MFLOPS which would be roughly 120 times the performance of the original VAX. With the optional vector processors added to the machine, this was sold into the supercomputer market as well. Prices ranged from $1.2 to $3.9 million. As the NVAX chip was available by the time the machine went on sale, offering good performance at a far lower price with clustering capability, the VAX 9000 didn’t sell well, and it was discontinued rather quickly. The same year, Digital chose to abandon their proprietary display system, and they adopted X Windows which was released for VMS as DECwindows. In the late 1980s, UNIX workstations with RISC CPUs were competing well against DEC’s offerings. The classic CISC design of the VAX just wasn’t up to the fight. This was the origin of the PRISM and MICA projects mentioned earlier, and as already stated, those were canceled. The response to these rival workstations was the DECstation 3100 released on the 11th of January in 1989. This machine was built around the MIPS R2000 clocked at 16.67MHz, a R2010 floating point coprocessor, and had a data cache of 64K and an instruction cache of 64K. This allowed the system to reach eleven million instructions per second which would be roughly equivalent to a 486DX at 33MHz released in May of the following year. The DECstation 3100 beat the first SparcStation too (albeit by a small margin), and it had around triple the performance available from the VAXstation 3100. The machine could be configured with 4MB to 24MB of RAM, and the graphics system supported a maximum display resolution of 1024 by 864. DECstations provided 10Mbps Ethernet with ThinWire, and a 5MB per second SCSI interface with a 128K buffer for which the machine had standard internal 3.5 inch drive bays. A cost reduced version of the 3100 was released in the summer of 1989 and named the 2100. The architecture was largely the same though the CPU was clocked at 12.5MHz. Later models in this line would ship with high-end graphics including both 2D and 3D acceleration, advanced audio capabilities, and even video conferencing capabilities with picture in picture support. Given that these MIPS-based machines were meant to compete in the UNIX workstation market, VMS was never ported to them. All of these systems ran ULTRIX. These machines were a moderate market success, but they never bested Sun or SGI in that regard. They are historically notable for being the machines on which the Mach microkernel was developed, and the machines on which early NT development took place. On the 10th of January in 1991, something happened at Digital Equipment Corporation that had never happened before. The company announced that it would layoff 3450 employees by the 30th of June. This followed a voluntary severance program that ended on the 31st of December in 1990. The company had hoped that more than 6000 would leave, but only 2550 of their 123,500 strong workforce took that option. The company’s stock had almost been cut in half from a high in 1990 of a little over $95/share to just $52.62/share. The company’s terminals and microcomputers couldn’t seem to continue competing with IBM clones, and the UNIX workstations were proving far more popular than both DEC’s own minicomputers and workstations. In both the commodity market and the workstation market, all of that competition was eroding margins. In the realm of very large machines, IBM’s mainframes were still king, and that market was quickly shrinking. On the 25th of February in 1992, Digital Equipment Corporation announced the DECchip 21064 (21 for 21st century, and 64 for 64bits), code name EV4 (EV for Extended VAX and 4 for the CMOS-4 process). While many sources cite the technology in this CPU originating from PRISM, this is only partially accurate, much of it was totally new. Initial pricing started at $3375 for quantities of 100. This chip is better known by the name it adopted in 1994, Alpha 21064. The DEC Alpha microprocessors were born, and the world was treated to a 64bit RISC chip that bested all of its contemporaries. This first Alpha chip was an in-order, superscalar microprocessor. It had a seven stage integer pipeline and a ten stage floating point pipeline. The initial 21064 was built on a 0.75μm process, could be clocked from 100MHz to 200MHz, had 1.68 million transistors on the die, had a 26.6W TDP, had an 8K instruction cache, 8K datacache, and an optional off-chip cache of 128K to 16MB. The databus could be either 128bit or 64bit. The clock generator, memory management unit, parity and ECC generators and checkers were all on-chip. The chip was packaged in a 431pin PGA that measured 61.72 mm by 61.72 mm. The heatsink attached to package via to two studs that rose from the tungsten heat spreader. The first Alpha systems made available for purchase were the DEC 3000 AXP workstation series, the DEC 4000 AXP server series, and the DEC 7000 and 10000 AXP high-end server series. The workstations were shipped in rather boring, beige, UNIX pizza boxes. For the operating system, customers could choose either OpenVMS AXP or OSF/1 AXP (later Digital UNIX, and still later Tru64). Initial sales for the DECstations were rather slow, and the machines failed to meet expectations in that regard. In April of 1992, Paul Music wrote in PC Week: A major reorganization at DEC has led to a shake-up in top management and raised questions about who will succeed company founder and president Ken Olsen. The 66-year-old Olsen, who founded DEC in 1957, has no clear second-in-command and has shown no signs of stepping down or specifying an heir apparent. Analysts say he has continuously eliminated people who might succeed him, weeding out executives who become too powerful; chief financial officer James Osterhoff recently left DEC after quarreling with Olsen about the firm's financial direction. Many observers are perplexed by the minicomputer company's management moves. Olsen was clearly the force behind recent changes in the firm's structure and is reportedly increasing his involvement in day-to-day operations. He controls DEC's board of directors, and few analysts expect the board to seek his ouster. Yet, with pressure from the board, on the 17th of July in 1992, Olsen announced he’d retire after having led the company for 35 years. At this time, the company had posted declining profits for three years, and three consecutive quarters of losses. The announcement that he’d be retiring shocked many as just the previous month he’d stated: "I have no thoughts of leaving." His retirement would be effective as of the 1st of October of 1992. Robert Palmer took over as CEO with the exit of Olsen, and he promptly restructured the company into nine divisions that reported to him. This reorganization was presented to the board in June of 1993, and DEC had its first profitable quarter. This was short lived as losses continued in 1994. For 1994, the DECstation line became the AlphaStation line, and the DECchip branding was ended in favor of Alpha. The entire line received technological updates. The varying busses of former models were replaced with PCI and ISA, and RAM limits were increased to 512MB. Later that year, Digital released the Multia (later known as the Universal Desktop Box). These were sold as workstations, but they had performance more similar to a desktop of the time. These could utilize either an Alpha or Intel Pentium CPU, and they ran Windows NT. The primary limit to performance was a reduced bus width (to 64bit from 128bit) and low RAM capacity (24MB). The release of the AlphaStations and Multia somewhat shows the direction in which DEC was choosing to go, but any doubt that they were focused on Alpha would soon be dispelled by the sale of Rdb to Oracle, the sale the PDP-11 to Mentec, and the sale of disk technologies to Quantum all in 1994. In August of 1995, the company sold their terminal lines to Boundless Technologies. With new markets opening up in the computing world constantly in the 1990s, Digital wanted to make a low power version of the Alpha. For this effort, the company reached out to Apple who’d been using the ARM CPU in the Newton. Specifically, DEC’s engineers asked if Apple would be interested in a high-performance ARM chip. The company was luke-warm on the idea, but they did say that they might use such a product. DEC then reached out to Advanced RISC Machines and began a collaboration. The result of this was the StrongARM which incorporated technology from both ARM7 and Alpha. Unlike previous chip design work which had taken place at the mill, StrongARM was developed at a design center in Palo Alto, and at another location in Austin, Texas. At the location in Austin, the staff was mostly comprised of folks who’d previously left DEC for Apple and Motorola, but who’d returned for the project. The first result of this effort was the SA-110 announced on the 5th of February in 1996. Clocks for these chips ranged from 100MHz to 233MHz, and these clocks were important considering that the design was scalar, in-order, with a five-stage pipeline, and no branch prediction. Early wins came with the Apple MessagePad 2000 and the Acorn RISC PC. The other big product of 1995 wasn’t a computer at all. Paul Flaherty had been tasked with undertaking a project that would properly showcase the power of the Alpha CPU and the lines of DEC computers that sported them. He was on vacation and had an idea. Upon his return to the office, Michael Burrows (indexer) and Louis Monier (crawler) worked to make that idea a reality. On the 15th of December in 1995, DEC made the AltaVista search engine publicly accessible on the World Wide Web. The search engine ran on two machines named Scooter and Turbo Vista. Scooter had a 20GB hard disk and 1GB of RAM and it did the page fetching/crawling while Turbo Vista had 250GB hard disk and 2GB of RAM and handled the index and web serving. Naturally, these were both Alpha machines. The company took advantage of its head count to test the system with 10,000 employees trying it out prior to launch. While the minicomputer and workstation company might seem out of place on the Web, Digital had registered dec.com in 1985 and digital.com in 1993. Let us not forget, DEC’s wonderful hardware had even powered many of the earliest networks that comprised the early internet. AltaVista was success. The site had approximately 300,000 hits on its first day of public availability; by the end of the year, the count had grown to 19 million requests per day. Two years later this traffic increased to over 80 million per day. In 1997, Digital continued to trim business units. Some of their network software was sold to BEA Systems, their printer lines were sold to GENICOM, and their network business was sold to Cabletron. In May of 1997, Digital Equipment Corporation filed a lawsuit against Intel for the infringement of ten patents DEC held on Alpha technology that were being used in the Pentium line of CPUs. Intel fairly quickly made a counterclaim that DEC was in violation of fourteen patents that Intel held. The two companies reached a settlement on the 27th of October in 1997. First, Intel bought Digital’s semiconductor manufacturing and development operations for $700 million. Second, the two companies agreed to a cross licensing of patents that they each held. Third, Intel got StrongARM (later became XScale). DEC did, however, maintain ownership of Alpha, and they retained the Alpha design team. When all of this concluded, DEC was essentially the Alpha company with a few insignificant PC-like products in its portfolio, and a killer search engine that they didn’t really monetize. On the 26th of January in 1998, Digital Equipment Corporation was sold to Compaq Computer Corporation for $9.6 billion. Compaq struggled after this with a far higher headcount as a result of the acquisition and a large set of products. AltaVista was spun out from Compaq in 1999, it was then bought by the parent company of Lycos. That company was purchased by Overture who was then purchased by Yahoo! in 2003. Alpha was abandoned in favor of Merced, and Compaq itself was bought by Hewlett-Packard in 2002. DEC was a pioneering company that changed the world for the better. Many people cite the failure of the company to quickly pivot to microcomputers as the key to its demise. I disagree. Ken Olsen correctly predicted that the PC clone market was crowded. He never really had an intention to go into that market (according to his own words on the matter). What I believe he failed to see was just how fast the Intel’s microprocessors would advance in their computing power and PC compatibles with them. He wasn’t alone in that failure. All of the minicomputer and workstation vendors (for the most part) made the same error. Even many of the PC clone makers themselves could not withstand the fierce competition in the market. If anything, what I feel doomed DEC was the cancellation of PRISM and MICA and the subsequent loss of talent that followed. DEC lost time, money, and people when they cancelled that project only to resurrect pieces of it later. The other problem for DEC was that the company had grown to be far too large in headcount far too quickly. It’s very difficult to turn 100,000 people around at the same time. To me, DEC was an absolutely amazing company that lost in the competition against the IBM PC clone makers, Intel, and Microsoft. I now have readers from many of the companies whose history I cover, and many of you were present for time periods I cover. A few of you are mentioned by name in my articles.

Title: OpenAI may be trying to wean itself off Nvidia

Like the broader artificial intelligence sector, OpenAI relies on Nvidia’s (NVDA) costly training chips to build tools like ChatGPT, but that could change — if OpenAI’s in-house chip design somehow pans out. The AI-software maker is close to finalizing its first design and intends to have Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) (TSMC) fabricate it, according to Reuters. Citing unnamed sources, the news outlet reported Monday that OpenAI intends to send its design to TSMC “in the next few months” and aims to mass-produce an AI-training chip with the fabricator in 2026. If OpenAI’s alternative design works out, the company would be a step closer to weaning itself off Nvidia’s coveted training chips, and in-house alternatives could empower OpenAI to negotiate better deals with suppliers, according to Reuters. Quartz reached out to OpenAI, TSMC, and Nvidia for comment on the report. OpenAI did not immediately respond, while TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The initial testing process alone could cost OpenAI tens of millions of dollars — a small price to pay relative to the $5 billion the company reportedly expected to burn in 2024 alone. Much of OpenAI’s expenses go to cloud-computing providers such as Microsoft (MSFT). Nvidia’s chips power Microsoft’s AI cloud offerings, and both tech firms have invested in OpenAI. OpenAI is also working with Oracle (ORCL) and Softbank (SFTBY) on Stargate, a Trump-backed, Musk-bashed project to spend as much as $500 billion on AI data centers. Early in the day, Nvidia was up by more than 3% — to around $133 per share. Microsoft, meanwhile, was up 1.15% — to around $414 per share.

Since eggs have become the new measure of how our economy is doing, it’s worth noting our local Costco is completely out of them, which, if in stock, cost nearly twice as much as they did in December. (Note: It was never about the price of eggs… It’s about racism.)

Title: Disney dumps two DEI programs as investors pressure company to ax more woke initiatives: SEC filing
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/02/10/media/disney-dumps-two-dei-programs-as-investors-pressure-company/

Disney is reportedly pulling back on its diversity, equity and inclusion policies — the latest major company to walk back the woke initiatives amid pressure from activist investors and the Trump administration. The media giant — which saw its bottom line hurt by the battle over Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill — quietly dropped its “Reimagine Tomorrow” program from the DEI section of its 2024 SEC 10-K report, according to a recent regulatory filing The program, which was mentioned in its 2023 report, has a mission statement of “amplifying underrepresented voices and features some of Disney’s DE&I commitments and action,” according to its website. The initiative promised 50% of regular and recurring characters across the Disney universe would come from “underrepresented groups.” The program sparked outrage in 2022 when a company-wide Zoom call was leaked on social media. One Disney executive touted her “not at all secret gay agenda” at the company, while another boasted that the company was ditching the words “ladies, gentlemen, boys, and girls” at its theme parks in order to not alienate transgender children. Although the program’s website is still up and running, Stefan Padfield, director of the Free Enterprise Project for the National Center for Public Policy Research, told Fox News Digital on Monday that its exclusion from the SEC filing could signal change at the Mouse House. “Disney dropping [Reimagine Tomorrow] from their DEI section could mean they’re walking back their DEI investments, or it could signal they’re hiding them,” Padfield said. “Either they recognize that more litigation is coming, or it could be part of a vibe shift.” The company has also dropped its “The Disney Look” appearance guidelines from the DEI section in its SEC filing. The 2023 SEC filing stated that the guidelines were “updated to cultivate a more inclusive environment that encourages and celebrates authentic expressions of belonging among employees.” Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Disney’s DEI policies were in part a reaction to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ “Don’t Say Gay” law, which barred the discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation for kids in public schools. President Trump recently ordered an end to DEI in the federal government and for its contractors, which includes many private companies. Meanwhile, companies are also under pressure from conservative critics who say DEI programs are discriminatory against non-minorities. Corporations such as Meta and John Deere have rolled back their DEI programs, while others like Apple and Costco have pushed back. Google, GM, Intel, Pepsi, Comcast, Philip Morris and others have softened or deleted their DEI language. “Where is your data that shows DEI serves the bottom line?” Padfield asked of companies that still employ DEI measures. “The concern about the scrutiny about these questions is built into this movement we’re seeing across companies. The Trump administration announced they’ll investigate nine companies for their DEI practices, and you’re seeing corporations scramble to not be among those nine,” he said. The DEI battle is also being fought in the courtroom. On Friday, Target was hit with a class-action suit, after shareholders alleged the retail giant misled investors about the risks of its DEI initiatives, which led consumers to boycott and its stock price to tank.

Title: Sen. Ron Wyden is here to stop Elon Musk

The Democrat from Oregon says ‘we’re going to use every tool’ to try and thwart Elon Musk’s DOGE. by Nilay Patel If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The Democrat from Oregon says ‘we’re going to use every tool’ to try and thwart Elon Musk’s DOGE. by Nilay Patel If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Today, I’m talking with Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat and the senior senator from Oregon. He’s been in the Senate for almost 30 years, which makes him one of the longest-serving members of the institution. He’s also deeply involved in tech policy — in fact, he co-authored Section 230 in 1996. That’s the law that says tech platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube aren’t generally liable for what their users post, making it the law that basically allows the modern social media internet we have today to even exist. We scheduled this interview with Sen. Wyden a while ago — he’s got a new book out called It Takes Chutzpah: How to Fight Fearlessly for Progressive Change, and it’s a combination memoir and call to action for young people to take part in politics. Wyden was going to come on and talk about that book. But recent events made it vastly more important to talk about the state of our federal government and, specifically, what Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are doing as they seize power in various federal agencies. DOGE has some level of access in the Treasury Department and now has its sights set on the Labor and Education departments, too. Numerous agencies have had their funding frozen, with workers locked out and told to resign or put on leave, all while lawsuits are being filed and courts are telling the administration to hold on. It is utter chaos, and it’s not slowing down. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! So I asked Sen. Wyden as bluntly as I could: What the fuck is even going on? And can Congress and the courts even keep up with it? Wyden did not mince words here; he called it a coup. You’ll hear us get into the mechanisms Musk has used to seize power in the government and why it feels like any attempts to slow this down feel so flat-footed. We also discuss whether we can trust anything these people say — Wyden basically calls bullshit on virtually every promise and declaration coming out of DOGE, especially around how much access its staffers have to sensitive data and systems. It’s the story of the moment and we dove into it. But if not for DOGE and its associated chaos, the biggest tech policy story of the moment would be TikTok, which was legally banned by an act of Congress and then upheld by the Supreme Court. But enforcement of that ban was paused for 75 days by President Donald Trump so the company could figure out how to sell itself. Right now, it’s just in a legal gray area, and that clock is ticking. So I asked Sen. Wyden, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, what’s going on with that ban and if Trump can really just keep delaying enforcement of the law, which is also not a great legal situation. Wyden seems to think a deal can get done, and I did my best to get any hints about who might buy it. There’s a lot more in this one, including some discussion of our networks themselves and Trump’s newly censorious Federal Communications Commission, but it’s probably best to just get into it. If you pay attention, you’ll notice that Sen. Wyden manages to seamlessly plug his new book throughout this episode. Okay, Sen. Ron Wyden. Here we go. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Sen. Ron Wyden, welcome to Decoder. Hey, thanks for having me again. Thank you for being on. There’s an awful lot to talk about, senator. You have a new book. There are an escalating series of catastrophes in the government. There’s TikTok to talk about. It’s still banned, but unbanned in a liminal state. I want to ask you about that. I was listening to our audience, and I was talking to our staff. Can I ask you the first question in just the bluntest way that I can think of? Can I have your permission for that? Permission granted, bluntness. All right. Senator, what the fuck is going on? That is the question of the hour. It’s almost impossible to divine an answer because it moves minute to minute. Donald Trump essentially governs by whim. He gets up and out of nowhere, he will put our whole economy in play with a really colossally stupid approach to tariffs — Tariffs that he has lied nonstop to the American people about for well over a year. He always tells them that foreigners will pay the tariff. That’s factually wrong. All of the people who are listening to your program, the fans of the good work you all do, they pay the tariffs. So, this weekend was just perpetual bedlam, and foreign leaders were basically laughing at us. They were making fake promises. They knew that Trump just wanted to be able to get some kind of headline. I’m sure we’ll talk about other aspects of the bizarre nature of these times, but you probably know that last Friday, I blew the whistle — as a result of getting input from whistleblowers — that the Secretary of Treasury had signed off on giving Elon Musk access to the federal payments program, which has enormous implications for hacking, abuse, and violations of privacy. The list could go on and on. So, that’s just a little bit of the last few days. Let’s start there. Again, just hearing from our audience, our listeners, and readers of The Verge, there is a sense that what is happening right now is Donald Trump is sitting in the White House, signing executive orders that may or may not be legal, may or may not have impact, may or may not mean anything at all, talking about building hotels in Gaza. And that is all a distraction from Elon Musk and DOGE taking over the government. We’re all the way at “is this a coup?” I really want to start there. Is that where you’re at? Do you think that there’s a coup going on? I’m very troubled by the types of policies they are pursuing, that when you add them up, look and feel like a coup. The reality is we are working very hard to derail them at various steps. Let me give you a couple of examples. Last week, Donald Trump basically undertook a kind of freeze of the budget, and he wanted to do it unilaterally. There was a lot of back and forth about what authority he might possibly have. We knew there wasn’t any, but we heard him out. Then we went to court, we won, and he had to drop it. Let me give you a small snapshot of the kind of work I do. My background is working with senior citizens. I was the director of the Gray Panthers for about seven years before I got elected to Congress. So, during the freeze, I found out that the Medicaid portals, which they have in all states, were essentially off. They weren’t available for the senior citizens and the disabled to get information about their medicine, nursing homes, and the like. So, I went online immediately, and said that the whistleblowers, which were truthful, had told me about the tremendous problems being caused for the vulnerable, seniors, and the like, and that it was important for citizens to get in touch with their elected officials, community groups, and organizations and talk about why this was so unfair. Nobody voted to cause harm and discomfort to seniors and the disabled. And there was this outpouring of calls and letters. Within about three hours, the Trump people were backpedaling. By late at night, they said that it would all be fixed the next day. This is just a small snapshot from one day, but people mobilized. The whistleblowers that I work with, particularly on senior citizen issues, came through. This was something where Trump and Musk were stopped cold as they tried to abuse the federal budget. It’s a small snapshot, but it’s the kind of thing that I tried to help with. If I were to embrace it in a sentence, apropos of what the hell is going on here: Trump and Musk are ignoring the checks and balances that are the foundation of our republic. And for all practical purposes, I’d call that a coup. When you think about the mechanism that you just laid out, you heard about something that was happening that was bad because of a policy that was hastily rolled out, you mobilized some attention, there was a swarm of negative feedback for the policy, and eventually, the administration backed down. Maybe it’s fixed, maybe it’s not. This is an open question. Programs are still being unfunded, right? I will tell you on this point, we check every day to make sure that seniors can get their Medicaid, their medicine, and access to nursing home information. But your general point is correct. There’s still a flood of abuses in a whole variety of programs across the government. Can that mechanism of “I need to blow the whistle, then maybe a flood of outrage that’ll fix it, or maybe we’ll file a lawsuit and our courts will fix it” keep up with the pace and scale of the chaos happening right now? We’re going to use every possible tool: court actions, legislative actions, whistleblowers, the bully pulpit. We’re going to use it all. We are still trying to find our way through the array of remedies that we have. When my wife agreed to marry me. She said, “You aren’t a real lawyer. You worked with the Gray Panthers. So, I’ll marry you because you’re not a real lawyer.” We’re now looking through all of the legal tools to make sure that we can protect our rights. But it’s not going to be a walk in the park. In some of these areas, like with the federal payments, nobody ever even thought of doing what Trump is doing, which is why it’s so important that we stop him. Let’s talk about that for a second. Do you know how much access Elon Musk has to the overall federal government right now? Has that been quantified for you or is it just ever increasing because it’s chaos? We believe that it’s ever increasing because to a great extent, Mr. Musk tells us that it is increasing. There was a big story that there wasn’t much being done, just general information. I got asked by the press about it late last night, and I said, “You got to be kidding me. Just look at all the stuff that he claims he is doing.” The first thing he went after was a charity. It didn’t have anything to do with waste, fraud, and abuse. I believe that we will move quickly in the days ahead to build more tools for a legal strike approach. We’re talking about that as members of a Democratic caucus. I’ve been tasked particularly with promoting privacy for those concerned that their data would be peddled hither and yon in the payments system. I can tell you that from a privacy standpoint, giving out people’s home addresses and the like, this will be a horror show. There’s a big question right now over whether Musk and his team’s access to that system is read-only or if they have the ability to write code. They have said it’s read-only. There’s some reporting that says they have the ability to write code. Do you know if it’s read-only? I believe that this is data that’s being abused now. Part of this is also semantics. I’m not taking anything off the table in terms of what they’re doing. They can write code. There’s no question about that. So, you think this argument over whether or not it’s read-only is a semantic distraction? That they do have full access to the system? Correct. There is no question that this description is designed to lull people into thinking that Elon Musk is not doing what he tells people he’s doing. I mean, he tells people that he is doing all these things, and then they put out these cover-up stories about how he’s not really doing it. We have a very technical audience. They’re very worried that we have increased the surface area for cyberattacks– No question about it! Let me save you some time. No question about it! Have you heard this from our intelligence agencies? Is this something Congress is worried about? I am on the [Senate] Intelligence Committee, so I can’t say anything about that. Is the Trump administration broadly being responsive to these concerns? Because we are at risk of cyberattacks. It’s a pretty bipartisan concern. No, the Trump people aren’t telling us anything about anything. Do you think they know what Elon is doing fully? You asked me if Trump just sits in the office and issues executive orders. I think that’s largely what’s going on. I’m sure they have some conversations, but I don’t get the feeling that there are any checks and balances on Elon. That’s for sure. There’s a weird gap in every Trump administration. I think it’s even weirder here in Trump 2.0 where Republican officials will not criticize the president in public. Are they understanding or aware of the scale of the problem in private when you talk to them? They’re saying very little in the consideration of the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. nomination. For example, yesterday I brought up that our committee, the Senate Finance Committee, had passed a bipartisan measure to rein in these pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) that are ripping off seniors, taxpayers, and people of all ages purchasing medicine. I pointed out that Medicare and Medicaid are under the jurisdiction of our committee and are subject to the kind of abuses that could happen with Musk and the federal payments. And they looked up. It was clear that what I said was registering them. I said, “This is important. This is something all of you have voted for.” But they’re not speaking out. In fact, yesterday, there was apparently some kind of Republican show trial where they basically all lined up and said, “Nothing to see here.” Do you think that holds? Let me put it this way. There’s no way this will be something they can just continue to stonewall. Let me give you an example. I announced five days ago that the Secretary of Treasury had given the keys to the kingdom, so to speak. Yesterday there were thousands and thousands of Americans outside the Treasury Dept. speaking out against these practices. Something like 30 members of Congress addressed this, making it clear that we were going to keep at it until we secured the protections that our citizens deserve. That happened all within five days. I give great credit to the whistleblowers. We heard a rumor that there was some activity going on with the Treasury payments, and the whistleblowers were the ones who specifically told me that Scott Bessent had signed off on giving the keys to Musk. That set of whistleblowers is largely the federal workforce, which is appalled. They’re filing their own actions from their unions as private citizens — just worker protection lawsuits. They’ve also all been told to quit their jobs, right? They’ve received these letters that say, “You should resign.” Musk famously used “fork in the road,” which is from a letter he sent when he took over Twitter. That may or may not be legal. There’s some big questions around that. Have you been hearing from that constituency? Yeah, they’d like some answers about it. You can hear the headline, “Oh, we’ll buy you out. We’ll give you all these opportunities to make a transition.” But most of the experience that the federal workforce has had with Trump — and it goes to the first administration — has not exactly been confidence building. They’d like more details about how they and their families will be affected. This is not just their current and future income, but making sure that the benefits they’ve accrued get treated fairly. What advice would you give to those workers that have received this offer? Proceed with great caution. Do you think that’s a farce as well? Do you think this is just a cover for mass layoffs? Is that something you’re worried about? Yeah! I don’t trust any of this stuff. I don’t want to sound like the old-fashioned version of a broken record, but I don’t trust any of this stuff. Often you go to these meetings and they act like they’re on the level, and then they go and do everything they want. That was the first administration, so I don’t trust any of this. When it sounds appealing and you can’t get specific answers, that ought to be a wake-up call to make sure you check. The law limits his ability to make mass layoffs, so that’s a big part of the debate too. We’re talking on a Wednesday. We usually publish Decoder interviews on Mondays. Usually, that’s fine, right? There’s two business days between us talking and publishing the conversation. Usually, not a lot happens in two days. You can be sure that a lot’s going to happen tomorrow, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Tomorrow, we have a hearing on international trade. I described some of the bizarre practices that they’ve pursued in this space, like how they keep saying that the foreigners are going to pay the tariffs but it’s going to be your listeners instead. So you bet, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, there’s no days off here with the Trump whims, as I call them. The specific question I had there involves Elon tweeting, “I work on the weekends when the other team is not in the field.” The other team that he’s describing is the federal workforce, so that is already problematic. But Congress goes into recess. People leave town on the weekends. Are you and the Democrats ready to be here all weekend to see what he’s up to? They’re making a big deal out of saying they want to work around the clock. Look, I told you that I have this book, It Takes Chutzpah. I’ve been using some of the lessons in It Takes Chutzpah all week to try and tackle the Trump administration. I was flying across the country and taking red eyes to make sure I didn’t miss a minute in the effort to blow the whistle. That was what we were doing late on Friday night, in terms of Musk being given the keys to the Treasury payments. I know the Republicans are leaving town this weekend, so they managed to find ways to set an agenda that’s favorable to them. Has the DOGE team been responsive to you or other Democrats at all throughout this period? Absolutely not. I know no one who’s being briefed on the Democratic side consistently. At all, really. Is there a way for you to get that insight as a member of Congress? We’re continuing, for example, to follow up with individuals who used to work at the Treasury and tap them for their knowledge. That’s been very helpful. Obviously, I can’t get into that. Are you planning to find a way to hold hearings on any of the committees you’re on or call Elon as a witness on any of the committees you’re on? We’re going to use every tool to excavate the information that the American people deserve. This is one of the most important issues I’ve tackled in my time in public service. It’s actually one of the first rules of Chutzpah that I spell out: “if you want to make a difference, you have to make some noise.” We’re making plenty of noise right now. We just have to keep following through until we get the job done. One of the weirder aspects with Elon Musk in all of this is that he owns a communications platform, the preferred communication platform of many members of government. Is that a problem, that he can command attention, that he can run that algorithm any way he wishes? Do you think you have to go somewhere else? There are certainly questions with respect to how he runs his operations, and there’s certainly some questions involving China as well. We’ll have some more to say about that before long. You are famously one of the authors of Section 230, which protects service providers from liability for the content their users post. Elon is the service provider. He’s also the user that is posting the content. Do you have any newer thoughts about Section 230 in all this mix? Do you think it’s doing the job the way it’s intended for it to be working? I’ve said this on your show, but I’ve always felt that the big guys — of which Elon is about the biggest — always have the biggest checking account to be able to buy what they want. Elon Musk just bought a presidential campaign. He basically was the big giver. Section 230, as you and I have talked about, is all about making sure there’s a voice for the little guy: the #MeToo [movement], Black Lives Matter, the people who probably couldn’t get a message out without what Section 230 involves. I think that Section 230 continues to be an immensely valuable tool for the person who doesn’t have a political action committee, doesn’t have power, doesn’t have a deep checkbook. We’re going to have a problem reining in the Elon Musks no matter what because they can buy the kind of government they want… at least until we get rid of things like Citizens United. The other rich guy in the mix this time is Mark Zuckerberg, who also owns several large communications platforms. He’s notably changing his moderation standards to favor the Trump administration’s desires. He’s allowing more hate speech, particularly against trans people, on his platform. That’s something that Section 230 protects, right? That platforms can moderate however they want. Ideally, you have some competition for moderation standards to push and pull and give people places to go, but we don’t really see that today, right? We see sort of a herd mentality. There’s some competition. Anybody can sue Elon right now. He posts lies himself. Section 230 protects Elon’s competitors against Trump’s FCC. There are protections, but the bottom line is that when you have somebody as rich as Musk, who literally bought a presidential campaign, you’ve got to use every tool you got, and a lot of them are not Section 230. There’s another platform in the mix that seemed very relevant during the presidential campaign, TikTok. It was banned, the law passed, the Supreme Court upheld it, and Trump paused enforcement of it. Do you think that Trump’s enforcement pause on TikTok is legal? Is that just him pushing his authority some more? I don’t think it’s legal, but here’s what I think this debate is all about. The reality is that from day one I had the same position, unlike Donald Trump. Donald Trump was against it, and now he’s for it. I always said it would be a good thing to have an American company run TikTok and have them tightly vetted. That would, for example, have limited [former Treasury Secretary] Steve Mnuchin and others who talked about getting access to it. I’m still in favor of that as a policy issue. The question now is what the courts are going to say given that there’s been an act of Congress, but I have not changed my preference once since the very beginning. What were the problems with TikTok under ByteDance that required that original ban-or-sell law? I’m on the Intelligence Committee, and the issue is the closeness to the Chinese government. That was a national security issue. There’s a lot of young people today who would say, “Sure, but then, Elon Musk is going to buy it and we see what he did to X. That is as much of a national security problem today as the Chinese government owning the algorithm.” Musk could not pass the Ron Wyden test because you would have to have a reputable American buyer who’d been thoroughly vetted. I don’t think Musk, with all his China connections, could pass the test that I’ve described. Have you heard about any buyers for TikTok so far? Rumors, but nothing that I’m going to splay out in front of a national radio audience. The reality is Trump, as he usually does, just governs by whim. He starts off by saying, “TikTok is bad.” Then he learns that there are a bunch of young people who like it, and suddenly, he’s trying all of these exotic ways to deal with it. I said from the very beginning that my first choice was to have an American buyer who could pass rigorous vetting to show that they were independent and would meet public interest standards. I don’t think Trump’s interested much in that. In fact, you’d think that at some point, he’s just going to figure out a way to hotwire a deal where he sells TikTok, in some way, to Musk directly. And if he does, that’d be about the most corrupt example I could find. That vetting process is not contemplated in the bill, right? It’s an interagency process. Yeah, this would take extra work to lock it in place, but that’s been my position from the beginning. The reason I’m focused on this is that I see a lot of danger of algorithmic ownership. You see how Musk has managed to distort the conversation on X because he owns that algorithm. I don’t know how changing the content moderation standards on Facebook and Instagram will play out, but my expectation is a lot of minority and queer creators are going to face a lot more harassment on those platforms because the rules have been changed. The algorithm will allow more things to happen. If the danger of TikTok is, the algorithm is owned by somebody– Hey, can I just make one point I think I may have misstepped on? I am not for the ban. I am for finding a way to get this right with an American buyer. Right. I guess my question is if divestiture was required due to Chinese ownership of the algorithm, which would run counter to US interests, do you think that having some amount of algorithmic transparency or privacy protections would solve that problem with American buyers as well? From our audience, what I hear is that all you really need is algorithmic transparency, and then, China should be able to do whatever it wants. Not only do you need algorithm transparency, you got a guy who’s authored a bill that moves in that direction called the Algorithmic Accountability Act, my legislation. Under a Trump administration with this Congress, do you think that will go anywhere? We’ll see. A lot of people now understand that algorithms are pretty complicated, but when you talk about protecting people’s education, healthcare, and jobs, they get interested. Sure. Trump gave 75 days, which is just a number he apparently made up, and if we hit the 75 days and he says, “I’m going to extend it again,” do you think there will be litigation, at that point, about whether the law is actually in effect? Hard to say. Would you support that? We can’t just keep indefinitely postponed enforcement of a law? I think I’ve described the path to get this done, and I’m going to keep working for that. What do you say to TikTok creators right now who don’t know if their businesses will last another 50 days? I’d tell them I’m busting my chops to get them something resembling an American buyer who’s been carefully vetted and protects their interests and all American interests. Do you think Microsoft is a good buyer? For the audio listener, Sen. Wyden looked away first before he began answering that question. Put me down as pretty dubious, but we’ll see. All right. What about Oracle? No. All right. What about Frank McCourt’s Project Liberty? No. No, across the board. Right. I think we ought to bag it on these kinds of folks. I’m just curious. Okay. Amazon? I’m just not going to get into a lineup evaluation batter by batter. In the tech world, this is everyone’s parlor game beyond “does Elon run the government.” Those are the two things everyone talks about at the parties I go to. So I’m just curious. It has to be done. The clock is running out. I think we got pretty far down the road in terms of Elon running the government and what I’m going to try to do to stop him. We probably have a ways to go in terms of TikTok, but I think I’ve spelled out what I think ought to be done. At least it’s consistent from day one. Last question on TikTok, and I promise I’ll move on to the FCC because I’m very curious for your opinion there as well. The clock is running, right? There’s only 50, 60 more days. Do you think the deal can be made in time? Yeah, but you’re really going to have to hustle to get the right kind of parties and go through the process. But yes, it’s doable. Let’s talk about the FCC again. You are a First Amendment advocate. You have said to me on this show, to people on other shows, that Section 230, which you co-authored, is really about the First Amendment, and most people’s problems with 230 are really about First Amendment-protected speech. The First Amendment, from my point of view, is under the greatest full-frontal attack I’ve ever encountered as a journalist. Could not agree more. It is bizarre to me. It’s particularly bizarre because it’s wrapped up in the language of free speech. In particular, that language comes from new FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who is attacking CBS, NBC, ABC, and radio stations about how they’re using their spectrum and threatening to take that spectrum away. Is Congress paying attention to this? It feels like a sideshow, but to me, this is the most overt government speech regulation I’ve ever seen. It’s not getting a lot of attention in Congress, but I’m doing everything I can to light the place up around it because I share your view that a big chunk of what the Trump crowd and the far-right want to do is act in the name of free speech. They make all these proclamations about how they’re about free speech, but they’re trying to do everything possible to deny the voices they don’t agree with. Have you spoken to the chairman about the FCC? He put out a blog post today saying that he’s worried about TV commercials that are too loud, which sounds like it’s straight out of the 80s. At the same time, he’s opening inquiries into CBS News. Have you spoken to him? Have you pushed anything? I have not since his appointment, but it’s very predictable. They find something to try and make sound relevant, but it is completely irrelevant to the big question. That makes it less likely the public’s going to pick up on the big question. I’ve had 1,103 town hall meetings, and you can read about them in It Takes Chutzpah. They’re open to all, and I don’t give any speeches. I just show up and say, “For the next 90 minutes you can say your peace. Ask me any kind of question.” It is, to me, my vision of the First Amendment. My dad was a journalist and an author. Right next to me is one of his books on the Bay of Pigs, with a picture of Fidel Castro next to my dad in the book. The caption is “Peter Wyden knows more about it than we do,” coming from Castro. So, I’m a journalist kid, and I think the Founding Fathers, who said that a free press was more important than government, got it right. And I believe that. Normally you would see these big companies look at an FCC (particularly a 2025 FCC) complaining about news distortion over their broadcast spectrum, and they would just bat it away, right? They would send the lawyers, the lawyers would fight, and they would bat it away. Meta was sued by Trump himself for banning Trump while he was president, saying that was somehow a state action. Very confusing. Meta settled this case and agreed to pay Trump $25 million for his library. It seems like CBS is going to end up settling the 60 Minutes case. Hey, let me give you the real– But I’m just asking, the big companies are caving on the First Amendment. They’re the ones that should be fighting. They are caving like crazy, and nobody has caved more than Mark Zuckerberg. So Zuckerberg goes to Mar-a-Lago, and he tells Trump what he wants to hear. There aren’t going to be any fact-checkers. “Okay, Donald, just what you wanted. No fact-checkers.” He scores some points with Trump. My guess is that seeing how this was successful for Zuckerberg, a lot of the other big players are going to go down to Mar-a-Lago and look for favors also. In the process, what’s going to happen is that we’re going to re-consolidate big communications and have even fewer small voices than we had before the internet came into being. We ought to be protecting those small voices. What Zuckerberg is now a part of is doing more to help the big voices, and in effect, push the little guys out of communications. That visit by Zuckerberg to Mar-a-Lago and what he did with the fact-checkers was a god awful thing to do for the future of communications. But if Zuckerberg caves, Disney caves, and Shari Redstone caves because she wants to sell Paramount to Skydance so she rolls with the CBS lawsuit. No one shows up in court and says, “Actually, these threats violate the First Amendment.” Don’t we just lose the First Amendment? Doesn’t the pressure just work? How do you push back? We’ll have to find ways to crank up the pressure, and I’m going to do that. You have people like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) that might step in, or other kinds of groups. ACLU. The ACLU, EFF, Ron Wyden, and those are your three. Sign me up. The argument I’ve heard from the other side — I’m not saying I agree with it, but I’ve heard it and I understand where it comes from — is that these are mercenary moves. Meta spending its time and energy fighting a First Amendment lawsuit instead of just paying the money runs the risk of them losing, right? It’s worse for Meta to roll into courts — especially all the way up to the Supreme Court, which is 6-3 conservative — and lose a First Amendment lawsuit than to just pay the money and leave the law effectively where it is, even if the norms change. Do you buy that argument? No. I think that both of them are harmful, and I think Zuckerberg is looking at buying whatever influence he possibly can because he sees it works. It’s not that complicated. Write big checks and you get influence with Trump. Carr is now targeting NPR and PBS. He’s saying that they’re technically running ads by asking for viewer support even though they’re publicly funded, and that he should look into their content. Is there a way for us to try to protect NPR or PBS? The best way to do it is by statute, and we’ll see if any of these rural Republicans whose farmers really like those services in the morning are going to stand up for them. What we’re describing is continued good business for the big guys, and they’re doing all the things possible to run out their competition. That includes virtually everything you can see. I’m trying to find new ways to get voices for people who don’t have power and clout join with a Republican trying to get more streaming services. So we’re busy looking for all the options, like getting C-SPAN out and streaming. You’re talking about rural farmers. You spoke earlier in the show about the outcry from people and Republicans backing down. Are you seeing the policy hit on some of these Republican constituents actually driving change? Are you able to reach those populations? I think a lot of people are worried that they’re fully captured by whatever TikTok right-wing influencer they see. It’s very early. I gave you some examples where we had some effect, but let me give you the bottom line here. I think very rarely does political change start in Washington, D.C. and then trickle down. I believe it’s almost always in the exact opposite direction. When people at home get concerned about access to communications they care about and whether they’re getting clobbered by tariffs, they go to their elected officials. They’ll see them in a grocery store, they’ll see them at the gas station, they’ll see them someplace and say, “What the hell are you doing? I’m getting clobbered on that.” And you end up making change. It’s a grassroots, juggernaut setting in that really changes things. I probably use that as much as any legislator. The way we were the architect of the PIPA-SOPA movement when all the power, all the money, was out trying to redesign the internet for the big guys. I organized a lot of grassroots groups, and [Sen.] Harry Reid set a date for a vote, and suddenly, 15 million texts and emails came in, and we beat all the money. You’re saying, “Do you see all of this happening yet?” When I was with the activists yesterday at the Treasury talking about trying to rein in Musk, I said, “This is really stunning.” This is less than five full days after I blew the whistle on the problem. And look, we got thousands of people and 30 legislators in the streets. So put me down as continuing to believe that citizens who mobilize can make a difference. That’s what I describe in the book. The book, for example, gives 12 rules, “Ron’s 12 Rules of Chutzpah,” that describe not just how people are looking at past examples, but how you can use the rules outlined in the book to make a difference. That was the first rule that we used yesterday: fight bad things, make a difference and speak out for good things, and above all, make noise. The book is really about pushing for progressive political change. You have a history of doing that. I think the question on everyone’s mind right now is when the other side doesn’t seem to care, and you can’t reach their constituents because they own the media platforms and their algorithms are driving all kinds of views that honestly just dismiss any concerns or turn the Democrats or any opposition at all into cartoon characters, how do you drive that kind of grassroots change? You have a lot of people who voted against their own interests here. They voted for cheaper egg prices and they’re getting Trump saying they’ll understand when terrorists drive prices up. Yeah, but they’re also catching up in a couple of weeks. Musk’s popularity numbers are really low. They’re finding out that Donald Trump tells them, “I am going to lower the prices of your groceries” — he said that point-blank — and then, he puts up a white flag of surrender a couple of weeks later and says, “Nope. Can’t do anything about it.” We’re going to build every single day between now and 2026 as many wins on the issues and matters people care about. It’s not sitting around and waiting. When we did that during the first term, we gained a few seats at the midterm. Two years later, we beat them all together. This is not going to be an easy walk in the park, but I’ve been part of efforts where I was able to beat incredible odds, which is what chutzpah is about. Chutzpah is about being bold, taking on big odds, and reaching out and finding people with all points of view. That’s what we’re going to be doing. Can you do that when you don’t own the communications networks? Just to boil the question down. Elon Musk owns Starlink in a world where– I’m talking to you, and you guys get the message. That’s true. You guys get the message out, and this guy’s working to make these changes that we’re talking about. He’s got a book that tells you how you can do more of it. There you go. I hate to hammer on it, but you can see the bigger picture. You have a Brendan Carr at the FCC putting pressure on legacy broadcast media. You have a Mark Zuckerberg and an Elon Musk telling their algorithms what to do, what kind of media to disseminate, and what’s acceptable speech and not. You have a TikTok sale in the offing that could go to a Trump loyalist. Is there an alternative media? Do you look at Bluesky and say, “Okay, decentralize social media. Provide a necessary check.” I’m on Bluesky. I love it. But if you want somebody who’s just going to say, “All I’m going to do all day is hang crepe because it’s hopeless,” I’m the wrong guy. I’m a 29-year-old Jewish kid who wanted to play in the NBA. That was a ridiculous idea. I got a scholarship, but I couldn’t get that dream, and I ended up being one of the youngest people elected to Congress by beating an incumbent. Guess who else did that not very long ago? [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], again, beating incredible odds. So, you’re talking about ways where you can really make a difference and beat the odds. Frankly, it takes a lot of chutzpah to do it. People say it’s hard to beat the powerful and the money, but I just gave you some examples of doing it. There’s a big split right now in the tech community. You have a lot of regular workers at the big tech companies who are horrified at what’s happening, and then you have their bosses who all showed up, sat at the inauguration, and are trying to get various things out of the Trump administration. As you said, I think they realize they can just write checks and get what they want. But their interests are not aligned. I don’t think Tim Cook’s interests and Mark Zuckerberg’s interests are aligned. I don’t even think they like each other. I don’t know if Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk like each other. I think they’re pretty ferociously competitive about their rockets and general cowboy demeanors. Is that a split that you see that can be exploited for political gain here? That the interests of tech, which has now taken over, are not actually aligned? If you look at the chutzpah rule, you say you’ll work with anybody regardless of political philosophy to get the public interest. I think that if Trump equals chaos, we’ve got more to work with than people think. Have you heard from that constituency at all? From the big tech companies? What I have heard from their executives, very directly, is that they thought the Biden administration hated them, that they could not work with Biden at all. They couldn’t even get the meetings they needed or meetings with the right people. What they generally got was, “We’re going to break you up,” and then there were a lot of lawsuits aimed at breaking them up. What you might still get out of the Trump administration is, “We’ll break you up, but you might be able to buy your way out of it.” Let me tell you what I think a bunch of these big tech companies are saying. Yes, they didn’t like the policies of the Biden administration, but they’re seeing more and more particularly young people — you see it in schools, on TikTok, and the like — who want to have their own businesses. They want to be entrepreneurs. They want to be the future. I think that big businesses who don’t pay attention to the small guys that have ideas and creative approaches are making a mistake because that’s who I’m throwing in with. I’m throwing in with the little guys because I think they can make a big, big difference. Biden was a big opponent of mine in technology for 30 years. I don’t think that the Democratic Party is about being for Big Tech. I think being for small business is going to be the future of the Democratic Party. In fact, small businesses and users. The two people that I fought for in the tech space are going to be my vision for the Democratic Party going forward. You can count on that. Is there any lesson you took away from DeepSeek? The big tech companies are spending or want to spend enormous amounts of money on data centers, on energy– The real message is how important open source is. Open source communications have got to be in the ballgame. I’ve continued to push them through all my time in public life, and it’s even more important today than it was. The other lesson there is that restricting chips to China didn’t work. The Chinese companies were able to take somewhat underpowered Nvidia chips, over-optimize them, and then outcompete. Because I think we’re wrapping up pretty soon, let me just mention that the Chinese are engaged in all kinds of abusive practices. Salt Typhoon, for example. The phone companies were supposed to have secured the phones 20 years ago, and I’ve been screaming my lungs out about it. I’ll be introducing another bill on this because when this latest set of breaches took place, a bunch of conservatives in the Congress said, “This is the biggest hack in American history.” Well, I’m going to make sure that we get another debate on this whole set of abuses. My bill will be going in soon. Salt Typhoon didn’t collect a lot of attention, but this is a massive breach of the American phone system. Stunning breach! The Biden administration was telling people to use secure and encrypted communications. Why do you think that went so unnoticed? I think that a bunch of the big companies you mentioned, like Microsoft, all said that they were taking care of things and tried to lull people through it. It wasn’t until the Chinese actually got away with it that anybody woke up and said, “Oh my goodness Mildred, we’ve got a problem.” On the same note, the notion that we would ban them from having our chips and that would keep them from competing in AI? I don’t know if that worked. I am looking at DeepSeek and saying, “Well, constraint breeds creativity. They got really creative, and they built a cheaper model that performs as well as our most expensive models.” Do you think that it’s time to rethink that approach to technology limitation? I think that’s a fair judgment. We understand that we have national security interests, and we’re certainly trying to compete with these people all over the world. And rethinking this is a sensible idea. We can’t stop China from getting chips, but we can certainly notice if it’s more expensive. We can make it more expensive. To bring that all the way back around to the top. Elon Musk, who may or may not be running part of our government, has significant ties to China. It’s a huge market for Tesla. You’ll hear a bit more from me on this very soon. Can you give us a preview? Nope. I’ve got to go through all the security rules and all the rest, but you’ll hear more about it soon. Do you think whatever you have to reveal will provide the necessary momentum to stop the chaos run of Elon Musk through the government? I think people are going to pay attention to it. It’ll be an important part of the debate. Sen. Wyden, I think we’re out of time. Thank you so much for being on Decoder. This was great. Thank you for letting me ask that question so bluntly at the top as well. No, I appreciate it. You guys, really care about policy issues, and thank goodness. I’m going to ask you for your advice, and I mean this sincerely. Last question. The Verge has always only cared about policy issues. This has been a thing that we say. We write about policy, not politics, because policy is important to people. It’s real. But it seems, here in 2025, politics and policy are the same thing. Do you feel that? It certainly makes me reflect on the policy that I’ve always said. It comes up at town hall meetings all the time. I say, “The best politics is good policy because you get in a position to be able to win people over for the right reasons. The reality is that these are really serious questions that don’t lend themselves to quick thought. We have to be ready to babble on both fronts. Let’s get the best policy ideas that we can and then work like hell to have the grassroots support in order to get them passed. But here’s my pushback. It seems like right now, the politics are winning. The politics are about collecting as much attention, being as loud on social media, and being as “authentic” as you can be. That lets you do whatever harebrained policy idea you want, including announcing a takeover of Gaza from the White House. That feels like a meaningful split. How do you bring that back into alignment? I’m going to continue to say that it’s possible to make this temporary and we can move on. But it’s only going to come about with good ideas and political organizing that will have to mobilize people all across the country. I mean, you can’t fake the price of eggs. Donald Trump’s got a problem, and if we pound that issue, a specific policy matter… I am going to talk until I run out of larynx space about him saying he was going to lower food prices and then putting up the white flag of surrender two weeks later. Now, the homeowner is worried about the price of eggs and you can’t fake that stuff. We’re going to do the best policy and work like hell to make sure people know about it. This last campaign was particularly hard because we made a big candidate change very late in the game, and it’s pretty hard to get your issues out that way, and we can do better. Sen. Wyden, I’ll let you get back to work. It sounds like you have a lot to do. We’ll talk to you soon. Thanks. A podcast from The Verge about big ideas and other problems.

Title: T-Mobile will let anyone send messages using Starlink for free — even Verizon and AT&T customers

Full Content:
T-Mobile’s (TMUS) direct-to-cell (DTC) satellite messaging service powered by Elon Musk’s Starlink is now free for anyone in the U.S., at least for a limited time, as the company looks to draw in customers. The companies have been collaborating for a few years now, promising in 2022 to deliver coverage “above and beyond anything customers have ever seen before” through a new network using Starlink’s satellites. In December, Starlink parent SpaceX finished launching the first shell of DTC satellites and won regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission for the service. “We’re still in the early days — I don’t want to overhype the experience during a beta test — but we’re officially putting ‘no bars’ on notice,” T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said in a statement. “Dead zones, your days are numbered at the Un-carrier.” The service is currently in its beta trial and limited to text messages, although T-Mobile hopes to have additional functionality available by the summer. Services like WhatsApp, some mapping and trail apps, and the ability to send photos could be ready when the beta testing ends in July, T-Mobile’s head of marketing told The Washington Post. After that point, T-Mobile users will have to pay $15 per month for the Starlink service, although that fee will drop to $10 per month if they participate in the beta test during February. Customers paying for the company’s pricey Go5G Next plan will get the service for free. Verizon (VZ) and AT&T (T) customers will have to pay $20 per month per line. T-Mobile said on its website that it accepts users on a rolling, “first-come, first-served basis,” noting that there are limited spots available. The company says that Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 14 and later models, Google’s (GOOGL) Pixel 9, REVVL’s 7, and a slew of Samsung Galaxy phones are compatible with the service, but they need to be fully updated. Motorola’s (LNVGY) 2024 and newer models are also compatible. SpaceX has a number of partners in other nations, such as KDDI in Japan and Telstra in Australia, and worked with AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) to launch nationwide coverage in New Zealand in late December.

AI is causing tech sector layoffs, report claims When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. New Wall Street Journal reporting has revealed an alarming trend within the tech sector – much like sceptics anticipated years ago, artificial intelligence looks to be displacing human workers and leading to higher unemployment rates. The report found IT sector unemployment rates rose from 3.9% in December to 5.7% in January, or from 98,000 to 152,000 Janco Associates analysis of the US Department of Labor data. More broadly, 143,000 new jobs were added in January 2025 to the US economy, albeit at a slower rate than optimal. In fact, white-collar and knowledge workers are seen as the most at-risk when it comes to AI-induced job displacement. Jaco Associates CEO Victor Janulaitis commented: “Jobs are being eliminated within the IT function which are routine and mundane, such as reporting, clerical administration.” Companies are also reducing their reliance on programmers and system designers in the hope that artificial intelligence can deliver further cost savings. The number of software development job posts dropped 8.5% year-over-year in January 2025. Although last year's pattern was considerably lower than 2023, when layoffs.fyi tracked 264,000 tech sector redundancies, as estimated 152,000 tech workers still lost their jobs in 2024 – nearly as many as the 165,000 workers who lost their jobs in 2022. Recent notable job losses include Sonos (12% of its headcount), Meta (5%), Microsoft, Amazon and Google. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The report also suggests that further corporate investment in artificial intelligence could serve as an early sign that future job cuts could come – a trend described as “cost avoidance.” However, while certain jobs may be at risk, others remain in high demand. The report reveals that certain in-person and skilled roles are in greater demand than many white-collar positions – the 'in-person' element of that trend is particularly interesting, given the widespread return-to-office mandates that have been enacted post-pandemic. It's not all bad news though – Janulaitis revealed that January’s figures, which paint a negative picture for the year ahead, could indeed be artificially inflated by many companies who are looking to implement this year’s cost-cutting measures now, rather than later. Regardless, with a further 10,800 job cuts actioned in the first five weeks of 2025 across the industry, many workers are faced with an uncertain future.

Title: Crypto News Weekly Recap: Trump’s Tariff War, the Rise of AI Meme Coins, and New P2E Games

We’re back with our weekly crypto recap. If Trump’s presidency means one thing, it’s that there’ll be no shortage of crypto news. This past week, the newly inaugurated president (along with his immediate family and friends) continued to make headlines in crypto circles. We also witnessed noteworthy developments in AI and gaming. Here’s a recap of what happened in crypto recently: Now, let’s zoom in a little. The crypto market faced turbulence, with Bitcoin ($BTC) briefly touching $92K after Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports. Canada immediately imposed a counter-tariff, whereas Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum took a more cautious approach. However, there may be more strategic depth to Trump’s tariffs threats than immediate market reactions suggest. Specifically, it could be an attempt to weaken the dollar while maintaining low yields, thus forcing countries to shift from short-term dollar reserves to long-term Treasury bonds. Eric Trump appears to be his father’s main crypto advisor, as evident from his involvement with World Liberty Finance (WLFI) and the official $TRUMP meme coin. Last Monday, the presidential son tweeted ‘it’s a great time to add $ETH’ as the token dipped some 20% (on the back of Trump’s tariff war, that is). $ETH’s price subsequently rose from $2.3K to $2.7K. With an average $ETH purchase price of $3.3K, WLFI currently faces an unrealized loss of approximately $31M. Trump signed an executive order to establish America’s first federal sovereign wealth fund. Senator Cynthia Lummis then tweeted it’s a ‘₿ig deal,’ with the Bitcoin ₿, possibly hinting at an upcoming $BTC investment. This approach would mirror Norway’s sovereign wealth fund strategy, which already has indirect $BTC exposure through investments in companies like MicroStrategy. While Alaska and Texas have been successfully operating state-level sovereign wealth funds for some time, this is an uncharted territory for the federal government. Musk raised eyebrows with his proposal to put the US Treasury on the blockchain – all $1.5T of it. We’re talking about a blockchain that would handle everything from social security checks to federal employee paychecks. However, many are skeptical about the idea. Either way, this transition would force over 3M federal employees to start using blockchain technology and push crypto adoption to levels never seen before. Google CEO Sundar Pichai plans to invest $75B in AI, which he called a ‘small expenditure.’ It’s clear that AI is taking center stage in Google’s strategy, especially given how much of the company’s $95B revenue last year was tied to AI-related services. While Google’s yearly revenue increased 12%, Wall Street seemed jittery about this spending plan, which sent Alphabet Inc. shares down 10%. Capital inflows into the AI sector mean that AI meme coins and AI agent tokens might see more upside this year. In other crypto news, Mythical Games launched a Super Bowl promotion for NFL Rivals, its NFT mobile football game. The two-week event features 30 new player cards from the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles. In other crypto game news, a new move-to-earn (M2E) fitness app, StepMania, is now available on Telegram. It takes inspiration from StepN, a 2021 M2E game that attracted 5.6M users with its unique mechanic and sneaker NFTs. Trump’s pro-crypto strategy, shared by Eric Trump and Elon Musk, is bullish for the entire altcoin sector. That’s particularly true for AI tokens like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) in light of the current Big Tech AI race. MIND of Pepe is a self-sovereign agent that runs on Ethereum. It can analyze market data, deliver exclusive insights to its token holders, engage in discussions on social media, and even launch its own projects (including crypto games). Currently on presale, one $MIND token costs $0.0032924, but the price will increase in 14 hours. The project has raised $5.6M so far, and early adopters have staked 859B tokens at a 407% APY. After $MIND hits the ground running and lists on DEX, it could surge 10X, especially now that Eric Trump has endorsed the Ethereum ecosystem. This week, all eyes are on Trump’s crypto agenda and the AI sector. The effect of federal policy decisions on market movements is undeniable, so we can only hope the upcoming days will bring good news. Uncertainty forces investors to seek utility-focused projects like MIND of Pepe. Its data-backed market insights and ability to autonomously launch new projects make it one of the best presales in 2025. As always, however, be sure to DYOR and keep a cool head. The current crypto market is extremely volatile, so diversify your portfolio and only invest as much as you can afford to lose. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Mapping the learning curves of deep learning networks
URL: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012286

There is an important challenge in systematically interpreting the internal representations of deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing techniques are often less effective for non-tabular tasks, or they primarily focus on qualitative, ad-hoc interpretations of models. In response, this study introduces a cognitive science-inspired, multi-dimensional quantification and visualization approach that captures two temporal dimensions of model learning: the “information-processing trajectory” and the “developmental trajectory.” The former represents the influence of incoming signals on an agent’s decision-making, while the latter conceptualizes the gradual improvement in an agent’s performance throughout its lifespan. Tracking the learning curves of DNNs enables researchers to explicitly identify the model appropriateness of a given task, examine the properties of the underlying input signals, and assess the model’s alignment (or lack thereof) with human learning experiences. To illustrate this method, we conducted 750 runs of simulations on two temporal tasks: gesture detection and sentence classification, showcasing its applicability across different types of deep learning tasks. Using four descriptive metrics to quantify the mapped learning curves—start, end - start, max, tmax—, we identified significant differences in learning patterns based on data sources and class distinctions (all p’s < .0001), the prominent role of spatial semantics in gesture learning, and larger information gains in language learning. We highlight three key insights gained from mapping learning curves: non-monotonic progress, pairwise comparisons, and domain distinctions. We reflect on the theoretical implications of this method for cognitive processing, language models and representations from multiple modalities. Deep learning networks, specifically recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are designed for processing incoming signals sequentially, making them intuitive computational systems for studying cognitive processing that involves dynamic contexts. There has been a tradition in the fields of machine learning and neuro-cognitive science to examine how a system (either humans or models) represents information through various computational and statistical techniques. Our study takes this one step further by devising a technique for examining the “learning curves” of deep learning networks utilizing the sequential representations as part of RNNs’ architectures. Just as humans develop learning curves when solving problems, the introduced method captures both how incoming signals help improve decision-making and how a system’s problem-solving abilities enhance when encountering the same situation multiple times throughout its lifespan. Our study selected two distinct tasks: gesture detection and emotion tweet classification, to illustrate the insights researchers can draw from mapping models’ learning curves. The proposed method hinted that gesture learning experiences are smoother, while language learning relies on sudden knowledge gains during processing, corroborating the findings from previous literature.

Data for conducting simulations is available from https://github.com/linuxsino/iMiGUE and https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion. Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. 1 The advantages of using key point data are twofold. First, keypoint data conserves significant computing power; since each second of image sequences (i.e., matrices of pixels) may contain as many as 30 or 40 frames, running deep learning models on image sequences can be prohibitively expensive. Second, it provides better interpretability and understandability. Instead of being possible only through abstract information at the image-frame level, gesture detection can be operationalized as a sequential movement in keypoints across frames [57]. 2 The large batch size for emotion classification is due to each of its input data points using less space compared to the gesture input. 3 The spatial information arising from the gesture, specifically the keypoint coordinates in the gesture dataset, can vaguely help the model distinguish between gesture classes (e.g., hand vs. no gesture). However, this information remains a low-level cue, as the model lacks an understanding of what a complete hand gesture sequence or a no-gesture sequence looks like. Over the past decade, deep learning and neural networks have achieved remarkable performance in prediction and classification tasks in various domains, from machine translation and object recognition, to autonomous driving and reinforcement learning [1, 2]. As powerful representational learning tools, deep neural networks (DNNs) can capture complex patterns in data [1], yet understanding the nature of the information embedded in their multidimensional representations remains a challenge. Researchers have raised concerns about how DNN embeddings represent knowledge and how to holistically interpret these high-dimensional features [3–6]. Over-reliance on such models for decision-making could be detrimental in both research and applied settings due to their complexity and lack of explainability. This is particularly concerning when models rely on biased training data that does not generalize well to target tasks [7, 8]. Without a deep understanding of these models’ underlying properties, they may fail to align with the goals of their human designers. Recently, there has been a combined effort from cognitive science and deep learning to utilize representational learning to address model explainability concerns. These practices have become more prominent due to the success of large-scale models [17], especially large-language models [18]. For example, in the case of language models, examining the internal processes of the BERT Transformer-based architecture has shown that it may recapitulate common natural language processing (NLP) pipelines [19–21]. Chang and Bergen [22] found that the frequency and n-gram structure of word tokens significantly alters the training for language Transformer models learning these words. Inspired by this prior work, this paper outlines a technique for examining the learning trajectories of deep learning models, in particular recurrent neural networks (RNNs). There is historical precedent for our approach, too. McClelland, Rogers and others have studied the underlying knowledge of neural networks by tracking them as they learn [10, 23]. Despite this classic work in cognitive science, it is uncommon to see deep learning models that track progress as a way to unpack what is learned (e.g., going beyond simple RMSE curves; but see also [18], for a counterexample). We term this tracking a “learning curve,” as it resembles research on how human learners process incoming information and improve decision-making through iterations under different situations. A unique benefit with simulation is the possibility to examine many dimensions and measurements of the neural network over time. In the next section, we review recent work on interpreting DNNs and related models. We then introduce our approach based on learning curves. To date, various techniques have been proposed to interpret DNNs. For example, many model interpretability techniques provide task-specific and local explanations, such as saliency maps, attention maps, or Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), which interpret or visualize the localized influence of a region on the output. These ad-hoc approaches can be unstable, as even a minor change in a single pixel or hyperparameter can substantially affect the local relationships between input signals and output data [24]. Additionally, these local explanations fail to offer a global understanding of whether the selected architecture is well-suited to the task or how the DNN models experience learning. On the other hand, feature attribution methods like SHAP [66] and LIME [67], while conceptually easier to interpret and model-agnostic, tend to work more intuitively with interpretable dimensions typically found in structured tabular data. These methods are less effective for unstructured tasks, such as image and audio data, where feature dimensions are harder to define or interpret. While most techniques emphasize the qualitative interpretation of a model, such as what has been learned or captured by the DNN, the absence of quantifiable measurements makes cross-model comparisons in unstructured tasks particularly challenging [4, 5, 25]. We further provided a systematic description of different model explainability methods, along with their pros, cons, and use cases, as well as a comparison to our proposed approach in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313772.t001 In a foundational article on deep learning, LeCun and the colleagues [1] characterized DNNs as representation-learning methods utilizing multilayered large neural network-style models. Representations can be viewed as mental objects capturing semantic properties either observable or unobservable [26]. Different from traditional machine learning models, DNNs display remarkable flexibility and efficiency in encoding lower-level input signals, such as pixels, audio frequencies, or word tokens, into multidimensional vectors at a sophisticated level through multilayered nonlinear transformations [27]. These transformations generate multiple levels of representations that learn hierarchies of features at each layer [1]. The continuous numerical vectors (or hidden vectors) learned at each level are commonly referred to as “embeddings” and serve as dense representations of the original input data. Following this construction, numerous studies have demonstrated the correspondence between DNN-generated and real-world distributed representations among words and sentences [11, 28], speeches [29], images [9], objects [30] and scenes [31, 32]. Representational learning in DNNs offers fundamental contributions to cognitive science, as it can inform how cognitive systems process and organize knowledge, facilitating the comparison of learning processes between humans and machines [33–35]. Recently, several studies in cognitive science and neuroscience have highlighted the importance of integrative modeling between computation, human brains and behaviors [12]. Beyond comparisons of static end-point knowledge, scholars have begun exploring the potential correspondence in learning and information processing between DNNs and human cognitive systems, given that the current performance of DNNs can already approximate human performance across various domains [36–38] (see [18] for a review). For instance, the representations (i.e., embeddings) extracted from multilayered DNNs have shown significant accuracy in predicting neural and behavioral responses in humans throughout the hierarchy of learning and processing. This evidence spans multiple neural-behavioral measurements (e.g., fMRI, EEG, ECoG), modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, and language processing), and model architectures (ranging from simple embedding models like GloVe to more complex neural networks such as RNNs, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transformer models (for further details, see [9, 11, 12, 23, 39, 40]). Given the extensive alignment observed between DNN embeddings and neural-behavioral activities, and their presumed meaningful representational mapping with human cognitive systems, an analysis of how they emerge in learning would seem important to understand these relationships. Goldstein and colleagues [11] identify the temporal correspondence between layer-by-layer embeddings in GPT-2 and evolving neural activities in language areas. However, this temporality is restricted to layerwise representations (from low-level to high-level representations) rather than how streams of signals have been received and processed by models or brains [38]. Our aim in this paper is to use temporal analysis in a systematic way by separating and tracking the time course of a network’s learning across classification tasks, thereby enhancing the understanding of the emergence of representations in DNNs. The goal of this study is to unpack the “learning curve” of DNNs through a sequence of hidden representations when the model encounters any temporal processing tasks across its training. To do so, we sample the network’s performance by using its embedding vectors to classify groups of items in its training input. This allows us to map out the progression of the network’s discriminations across these groups – how the network’s internal knowledge, in the form of embedding vectors, evolves during training. The model architecture we focus on is RNNs due to their capacity to model sequential data and time-dependent tasks [41], such as text generation, speech recognition and stock market prediction. Although other deep learning architectures, such as CNNs and Transformers, also have the capacity to process time-series data, RNNs are explicitly designed for processing sequential data, as they effectively capture temporal dependencies through their recurrent connections. CNNs excel in tasks such as image recognition by applying the kernel trick, where convolutional filters are used to extract spatial features from local regions of the input. While CNNs can be adapted to handle sequential data using techniques like 1D convolutional layers, they lack the inherent ability to capture temporal ordering in the data, as they process each segment of input independently. Transformers, on the other hand, rely on self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different input tokens in parallel, allowing them to capture dependencies between distant elements (i.e., tokens). This feature makes Transformers better suited for tasks where relationships between tokens are not strictly ordered in time, and their parallel processing nature is less ideal for learning tasks that require explicit temporal progression. In sum, the strict sequential processing nature of RNNs makes them an intuitive architecture for studying cognitive processing that involves dynamic, changing contexts [42]. In this study, we propose a generalizable interpretability approach that maps the global learning curves of RNNs based on changes in classification performance between embeddings and output across timesteps of the input data. This performance reflects the predictive capacity or the amount of signal captured by the embeddings in predicting the final output. In RNN modeling, each timestep generates an embedding (e.g., in language processing, each timestep represents a word). These embeddings progressively incorporate information from the beginning up to timestep t. By examining changes in classification performance between these embeddings and the output, we can capture how the information evolves over time. To provide clarity, we use the term “learning curve” in this study to denote the holistic approach and intention behind mapping the underlying processing and developmental journey of DNNs. The method we propose separates two parts of the learning curve, one based on overall training, and another based on processing within input items during training. First, the “developmental trajectory” signifies the long-term learning process of DNNs, which is simulated by the increasing number of epochs (i.e., complete passes through an entire training dataset). Second, the “(information) processing trajectory” refers to the momentary accumulation of information across all timesteps (within an epoch), extractable from the performance of the RNN layer (see Fig 1 for a conceptual illustration). We detail each of these further below. The solid curve represents an individual information processing trajectory (across timesteps). For example, as an agent receives more signals over time in one session, its prediction of the gesture increases. The bundle of dotted lines represents a developmental trajectory (across epochs). For instance, this agent improves its ability to predict incoming gestures after repeatedly encountering similar patterns. In a typical binary classification task, the starting point at t=0 is expected to be near 0.50 (and gradually increase to 1.00 across timesteps and epochs) for all epochs because no signals have been provided at the first timestep for solving the underlying task. Hence, all information processing curves in this figure have the same starting point to reflect this pattern. In practice, certain classification tasks might contain structural information even at t=0 (e.g., gesture classification contains spatial information, such as the location of keypoints, at the initial timestep, which could help solve the gesture task from the very beginning). The solid curve represents an individual information processing trajectory (across timesteps). For example, as an agent receives more signals over time in one session, its prediction of the gesture increases. The bundle of dotted lines represents a developmental trajectory (across epochs). For instance, this agent improves its ability to predict incoming gestures after repeatedly encountering similar patterns. In a typical binary classification task, the starting point at t=0 is expected to be near 0.50 (and gradually increase to 1.00 across timesteps and epochs) for all epochs because no signals have been provided at the first timestep for solving the underlying task.

In practice, certain classification tasks might contain structural information even at t=0 (e.g., gesture classification contains spatial information, such as the location of keypoints, at the initial timestep, which could help solve the gesture task from the very beginning). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012286.g001 As Fig 1 illustrates, the resulting visualization consists of learning curves with timesteps on the x-axis and performance on the y-axis. Each epoch contains an information processing trajectory, and the set of curves together forms a developmental trajectory. Due to the multidimensional nature of this plot, while it provides rich qualitative information about the entire model learning experience, it can be challenging for researchers to comprehend all the constructed curves at once. Therefore, beyond the visual presentation and qualitative inspection of the multi-dimensional learning curves, this study further defines four measures: start performance (start, the initial capacity of each information processing), max performance (max, the maximum performance of each information processing), time at max (tmax, when the current information processing reaches the maximum performance), and end – start performance (end – start, the overall performance gain in this information processing) – to facilitate quantitative comparisons across tasks and datasets. Our study particularly focuses on these relatively easy-to-comprehend descriptive statistics (as opposed to more complex metrics like regression coefficients) to simplify the understanding of the already multidimensional and granular nature of the constructed learning curves. To illustrate the generalizability of our approach, we chose two distinct classification tasks: (i) sentence classification and (ii) gesture detection. These tasks differ widely in terms of their modalities. We predicted this would lead to variation in the underlying data generation processes and associated cognitive processing for each modality. In particular, gesture and body movements primarily result from the coordinated contraction and relaxation of muscles, with signals produced at later timesteps derived from the previous timesteps with relatively high autocorrelation [43]. On the other hand, verbal language, being a predominantly semantic modality, exhibits degrees of surprisal and arbitrariness that enhance the cognitive capacity of language processing [44–46]. Therefore, the expected developmental and information processing trajectories will likely exhibit distinguishable patterns across the two different tasks when the DNN system processes them respectively. As we discuss in detail in later sections, this method has a few benefits. Through tracking the learning trajectory of a neural network, researchers can explicitly identify the appropriateness of a model for a given task as well as examine the properties of underlying input signals. This approach could also serve as a standalone visualization to map the accumulation of the underlying signals processed, which can facilitate research on deep learning modeling and signal processing across various modalities. Finally, mapping the learning curve of DNNs has the potential to assist future computational cognitive and neuroscience research and address whether the learning experiences of models also correspond to (or fail to correspond to) the temporal processing in human cognition in addition to the emphasis on static representations in the current literature. In the following sections, we will provide a step-by-step method for visualizing the learning curves of neural networks, illustrate how to holistically interpret signal processing in them and quantitatively compare these curves across two different datasets. This research proposes a model-interpretability method that can extract the learning curve of sequence-based deep learning networks (e.g., RNNs). Inspired by cognitive science, the method measures the learning trajectory and underlying knowledge extracted by such networks. To illustrate the method, we use two temporal tasks: gesture detection and sentence classification as examples. This study therefore demonstrates that the method could inform a range of deep-learning tasks. Our multi-stage pipeline includes three main steps. First, we trained the RNN-LSTM model to generate a sequence of embeddings for a temporal task. Next, we used KNN classifiers to calculate the performance across all extracted embeddings, which we refer to as learning curves (see (2) in Fig 2). Finally, we defined four metrics to quantify these multi-dimensional embeddings for more systematic comparison and significant tests between tasks, classes, the null hypothesis, and development trajectories. The visualization of this multi-stage procedure can be found in Fig 2.

The two temporal tasks (i.e., gesture detection and sentence classification) are distinct in terms of their modalities, lengths, and the steps required to extract and preprocess the features, thereby enhancing the diversity of data to illustrate the learning curve analysis. We detail the preparation of each dataset separately below. The Emotion dataset [49] consists of 20,000 English Twitter messages with six basic emotions (e.g., anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise) by adopting Plutchik’s [50] wheel of emotions, Ekman’s [51] six basic emotions, and hashtags in tweets. Tweets were annotated through noisy labels and distant supervision introduced by [52]. To prepare the emotion sentences for recognition by the RNN layer, we first applied the “basic English” tokenizer from torchtext to tokenize each tweet. Then, we used GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation), a word vectorization technique that does not rely on local word context statistics (local-context information), to vectorize each token in a sentence. GloVe was preferred over other token vectorization techniques like word2vec [53] due to its design to capture the universal meaning of each token/word, rather than the word’s meaning within a specific sentence or context. We opted for GloVe embeddings with 300-dimensional semantic features because it strikes a balance between capturing sufficient information and maintaining computational efficiency [35]. In theory, the input sequences of RNN are not required to have the same length. In practice, these sequences are padded with zeros or trimmed to the same length to optimize the computation in PyTorch. Accordingly, all tokenized tweets were padded to a consistent length of 66 tokens, which corresponds to the length of the longest tweet sample. The shape of each Emotion tweet follows a 300 dimensions × 66 timesteps (see Fig 3). The iMiGUE is a high-quality dataset that contains 18,499 identity-free, ethnically-diverse, gender-balanced samples of 32 psychologically-meaningful micro-gestures (such as scratching an arm, adjusting the hair, or touching an ear [51]). These gestures were all curated from interview clips with athletes at post-match press conferences. Unlike other gesture and emotion datasets, which are typically drawn from staged performances or movie clips, the iMiGUE provides samples of actual gestures from real-life situations. This poses a more realistic, though more challenging, recognition task for deep learning networks [54, 55]. Due to copyright restrictions, the dataset includes only skeleton keypoints (rather than original interview clips) extracted from OpenPose, a multi-person computer-vision system that can simultaneously extract keypoints of the body, hands, face, and feet [56]1. In total, 25 body, 70 facial, and 21 left hand and 21 right hand keypoints were extracted for each frame using OpenPose. Keypoint data were stored in the following format: [x0,y0,c0,x1,y1,c1… ], in which (x, y) represents the coordinate of each keypoint and c indicates the confidence score of each keypoint-coordinate prediction. The confidence score was excluded in the following processing steps. Although the gesture clips have just 39 frames on average, they have a higher standard deviation at 84 frames with a 75th percentile of 72 frames. We therefore set the padded length of the input sequence to 150 frames to ensure that our input data contained sufficient information for training a classifier. Thus, the input size for each gesture clip was 274 units (137 keypoints × 2) × 150 timesteps (see Fig 3). NB: Gesture figures are adapted from Wikimedia Commons [47].

The learning curve analysis will show how that successful learning emerges, and which stimulus discriminations seem to underlie that emergence. Since even the state-of-the-art neural network can achieve only 55% accuracy on this multi-classification task [48], we further grouped the 32 micro-gestures into six categories (body, head, hand, body-head, head-hand movements and an absence of gestures) to ensure that our RNN-LSTM was indeed “learning” when we attempted to map its learning curve. We selected a model architecture (see Fig 4) that is standardized for sequential stimulus processing in the following way. First, we had a batch normalization layer, a primary RNN-LSTM layer, and then a fully connected layer to connect the final dense embeddings with the output classes (for classification). We offer details below. NB: Gesture figures are adapted from Wikimedia Commons [47]. NB: Gesture figures are adapted from Wikimedia Commons [47]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012286.g004 RNN is capable of modeling sequential data and time-dependent tasks [41]. Its architecture represents an iterative function that takes an input sequence (x) and an internal state (h) from the previous timestep (t - 1) to predict the current timestep (t), then updates the state as follows: (1) As the formula illustrates, each timestep t should theoretically reflect the information from 0 to t – 1. We selected the RNN model for gesture detection because it can process temporal information under the assumption that the body movement in each timestep depends on signals in the previous timesteps. While an RNN could leverage the context between elements by maintaining its internal state while processing the entire sequence, the “Vanilla RNN” layer experienced the vanishing-gradient problem during model training [58]. Therefore, long short-term memory (LSTM), which is represented by the function f in Equation 1, was introduced here as an additional state variable, called the cell state, for controlling specific information that needed to be kept or updated while processing the entire sequence [57]. LSTM effectively reduced the vanishing-gradient problem encountered by RNN [58]. The construction of our RNN-LSTM neural network follows common practice in deep learning. First, to enhance training stability and speed up convergence, we applied batch normalization, specifically the BatchNorm1d layer, to the input data at each timestep, with dimensions batch_size × timestep × input_dimension (1 × 150 × 274 for iMiGUE and 1 × 66 × 300 for Emotion). This means that each timestep is treated independently, and normalization is applied across all data points in the batch for each timestep. Specifically, this technique normalizes the inputs to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 within each timestep, standardizing the distribution of inputs across the data points in each batch during training. Then, an RNN-LSTM was applied to the normalized input to convert temporal information to a dense embedding at each timestep. An RNN-LSTM with an equal hidden dimension was selected to simplify the tracking of embeddings in the later stage. Finally, a fully connected layer, without any activation, was applied to the embeddings in the last timestep t to predict output labels. To ensure the generalizability of our learning curve mapping approach, we performed 15 rounds of simulation for both gesture and emotion detection tasks, each of which included 15 (6C2) pairwise binary classifications. We conducted 25 repetitions (reps) for each set of simulations (sims) to mitigate the idiosyncrasies of specific processing and developmental patterns we are extracting under each pairwise condition. In total, we collected 25 × 15 × 2 ( reps × sims × tasks) = 750 runs of simulation data. Having an adequate number of simulation runs also enables us to observe clustering tendencies in the convergence and divergence of trajectory patterns across various tasks and different classes. In each simulation, 20% of the shuffled samples were used as the test data, while the remaining data were further split into 80% training data and 20% validation data. While validation data were used for reporting each epoch’s model performance, test data were used for reporting the final model performance on unseen data. The number of epochs indicates the number of times an entire dataset has been passed forward and backward through the neural network. We set the number of epochs to 50 for both tasks, given that most of the variation in learning tends to unfold during the early stages of development. In S3 Text and S4 Text we also illustrate how using 20 and 100 epochs leads to similar observed patterns. Because deep learning algorithms are very sensitive to unbalanced datasets, we applied data augmentation to the training and validation datasets. Specifically, the minority class was up-sampled to match the number of data points in the majority class, which ensured a balanced dataset [59]. Default initiation from PyTorch was used to standardize the model specification across simulations. All simulation runs were trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, and the loss function used was the cross-entropy loss for all pairwise classifications. All the other learning rate hyperparameters were kept at their default values. Since deep learning is, computationally speaking, very expensive to train, the model was run on Nvidia RTX 4090 to expedite the processing. We set the batch size to 64 for gesture recognition and 256 for emotion classification to achieve an optimal balance between training speed and performance.2 To map a learning curve for each simulation, we first extracted embeddings of all LSTM timesteps from the hidden layer. We then applied multiple interpretable machine-learning models between these embeddings and the corresponding output labels to understand how the model’s confidence is updated during the LSTM timesteps. We extracted the LSTM array of all timesteps for all batches across all epochs on the test data to ensure that we were extracting embeddings from all developmental stages and the final model was adequately trained on the targeted task. Since we specified the same dimension of the input data for the LSTM hidden layer, for the gesture detection task, we obtained 150 LSTM arrays from 150 timesteps, each array having the size of 1 × hidden_dimension (1 × 274). Similarly, we obtained 66 LSTM arrays in sentence classification, each with a size of 1 × 300. We then stored the corresponding output labels of those arrays as an output array. Those LSTM arrays share one output array since they are embeddings at different timesteps of the same data points. For binary classification, the labels were encoded as 0 and 1. Once the model had been trained and the embeddings extracted, we stored and processed those embeddings in RAM, which has a greater storing capacity than GPU. To approximate the processing curve of a model’s confidence across the LSTM timesteps, this study used a popular machine learning algorithm, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) for identifying embedding “separatables.” This algorithm classifies an object by using a majority vote of its neighbor data points [60, 61]. Because embeddings are seen as a high-dimensional physical (i.e., location-wise) projection of input data (as opposed to a multivariate representation [1]), distance-based models, such as KNN and support vector machine (SVM), are popular choices for examining DNN embeddings in previous studies. Specifically, we applied KNN to the data point (, y), where is the LSTM embedding at t timestep and y is the corresponding output label and calculated the KNN accuracy across all timesteps (information processing trajectory) and all epochs (developmental trajectory), and thus captured the learning curve of the model. These learning curves examine how the LSTM’s embeddings classify the stimulus as it is incrementally presented to the network. Visually, each curve is plotted as the proportion of correct classifications across the item. These constructed learning curves can be analyzed in various ways, either through qualitative interpretation of the visualizations or by applying statistical analysis for quantification and hypothesis testing. In this study, we utilized the four descriptives statistics introduced earlier to assess the multidimensional KKN classification performance of the RNN-LSTM (i.e, how the discriminability of the model is evolving) across its training on two datasets, reconstructing and analyzing the unfolding learning dynamics of these distinct learning tasks. Specifically, for each such curve, we extracted four simple descriptive metrics: start, end - start, max, tmax. In Fig 5, we illustrate these descriptive statistics from an example trajectory of a single classification run for each dataset. From epoch 1 to epoch 50, the LSTM’s embeddings are able to classify successfully over the test item, and we can characterize this success as a change to its performance using four metrics described in the main body of the text (start, end - start, max, tmax). Top: Example item from the sentence task. Bottom: Example item from the gesture task. From epoch 1 to epoch 50, the LSTM’s embeddings are able to classify successfully over the test item, and we can characterize this success as a change to its performance using four metrics described in the main body of the text (start, end - start, max, tmax). Top: Example item from the sentence task. Bottom: Example item from the gesture task. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012286.g005 First, we defined the maximum performance (max) and the percentage of time at which that maximum was achieved in the presented item (tmax) over the whole timesteps. We included tmax alongside max because we discovered that max alone is not sufficient to determine performance, especially earlier in training. This is because the network may exhibit unstable performance, dropping across subsequent time slices, which may be indicative of a non-monotonic learning trend seen in related domains [62]. This also suggests the network has learned something about the initial segments of an item, but the later segments wash out its performance as it has not yet encoded these later features. To capture this trend, we use tmax to assess when that maximum was achieved within each information processing trajectory – specifically, the percentage of the time slice at which the observed maximum occurred. In Fig 5 above, we show an illustration of this in the top left. The network achieved a performance of 0.82 on this particular item, but failed to sustain this performance as it dropped to near 0.50 as the sequence unfolds (at epoch 1). In the top right, the performance improves approximately monotonically across time slices (by epoch 50), and tmax is achieved near the final bin of the training item. Additionally, we assess the performance at the start and end of the presented stimulus (start, end). Performance at the start may indicate the relative gains that can be expected from a stimulus item. As shown in the bottom panels of Fig 5, the gesture input already has performance above chance ( ~ 0.80) after the very first segment of the stimulus item. This suggests the model rapidly exploits spatial information in gesture (i.e., the location of keypoint coordinates can already vaguely differentiate gesture classes before sequential movement information is fed into the model). A model that achieves near-perfect performance at start and sustains it does not need to be exposed to the subsequent stimulus. The last measure we use is the subtraction of end - start performance. A high value on this measure suggests the network gets substantial information gains across a test item. For example, even at epoch 50 in the bottom right, the end - start of the gesture item is substantially lower than the simulation trained on the sentence task. These measures can be plotted across epochs. Each learning curve now indicates how an item is being processed across an LSTM’s overall training. The measures are relevant to two timescales in the network’s behavior we conceptualized earlier: developmental (or learning) and information-processing timescales. For example, across epochs, movement along the start measure represents the initial performance at the item’s first time slice at the beginning of each information processing session. The end - start measure within an epoch can describe the relative information gains during each processing session from the item’s full presentation. The max represents the best performance achievable in a session, indicating the network’s current information processing capacity. Finally, if tmax is low, it suggests that the network’s maximum performance of the current session is hindered by subsequent timesteps, implying that additional training may be necessary. We took the output from the KNN classification in Python, described above, and designed a sequence of R scripts to measure, visualize and quantify the trends in these four measures (start, end - start, max, tmax). R’s suite of visualization tools provided a convenient arena within which to view trends across epochs, and in these analysis scripts we also built linear models to statistically test the significance of these trends. All of the scripts in our methods are available at GitHub here: https://github.com/JoyceJiang73/Learning-Curves/. The R scripts only require input of simulation CSV data that contain as fields: binary classification labels, time slice, epoch, and performance measure (e.g., KNN classification performance). We have reported the trained RNN model performance for the average of all pairwise simulations of sentence and gesture classification (epochs = 50) in S1 Text, including metrics such as validation accuracy, validation loss, test accuracy, test loss, recall, precision, and F1. These results confirm that almost all pairwise classifications have been sufficiently trained, indicating that the learning curves are capturing the learned experiences. For each of the four metrics, we conducted a series of significance tests using regression models to assess distinctness across data sources, reshuffled null data, classes, and epochs. Specifically: (1) A linear model was used to assess whether the learning curves of the two datasets differed significantly, (2) A linear model evaluated whether the learning curve for each training classification task significantly deviated from a superimposed (randomly reshuffled) null hypothesis across the four metrics, (3) Linear models were used to assess whether the learning curves for each dataset were distinct by class and across epochs, and (4) An ANOVA test was performed to determine whether class differences contributed more to developmental progression than epoch alone. All the significance tests (Adjusted R-squared) are reported in Table 2, and the corresponding visualizations for each metric are provided in their respective sections. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313772.t002 In Fig 6, we show the LSTM performance at the start of an item across epochs of training. In general, the sentence dataset shows low, near-chance performance, while gesture classifications are already well above chance performance. This chance-level performance for sentence items stays consistent across the entire training period, though the gestural dataset shows some improvement. For the gesture dataset, this suggests that the network has some information about a classification before much of a training item is even shown to the network. It would indicate that gestural data has spatial information in the point coordinates of the body and is exploited by the network at the very first time bin. With language, it takes time for word embedding vectors to be integrated in the network. To confirm these trends, we tested a linear model that predicted start performance by training data, showing that dataset accounted for about 98.14% (p < .0001) of the variance seen in Fig 6. The classification of the gesture data accounts for 95.51% (p < .0001) of variance internally to that dataset, whereas for sentence classifications accounts only for 10.28% (lower but also significant, p < .0001). The learning curves reveal that the first word of a language task has low diagnostic accuracy for a classification, but the spatial variance over gestural classifications is much more informative. The start performance for sentence null is the only metric that shows no significant difference between learning from ordered sentence classes and reshuffled data (among all significance tests; = 0.0001, p < .0879). This is expected, as all sentence binary classifications begin with a consistent initial performance of 0.50 (random guessing for binary classification), which remains unchanged even with randomly reshuffled sentence data. In contrast, the start performance significantly differs for ordered gesture classes versus reshuffled data because the various gesture pairs contain different levels of spatial information ( =0.0824, p < .0001), affecting their initial performance. Start metric over epochs, indicating that in the sentence task, the classification at the first time slice remains stable near change, whereas the LSTM’s embeddings for the gesture task are distinct across stimulus types, and also show slightly more improvement over training (while already being well above change relative to the sentence task). Start metric over epochs, indicating that in the sentence task, the classification at the first time slice remains stable near change, whereas the LSTM’s embeddings for the gesture task are distinct across stimulus types, and also show slightly more improvement over training (while already being well above change relative to the sentence task). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012286.g006 Curiously, if one only investigated maximum performance across training, these classification tasks could be regarded as relatively similar in their behavior. As shown in Fig 7, both sentence and gesture datasets yield a classification performance that is high, between 0.75 and 1.0 depending on the classification. In the gesture dataset, there are more “difficult” classifications, shown by outliers in max performance across training. This can be helpful in diagnosing representational challenges in the network’s training, marking what pairs of training items may be more difficult to distinguish than others. Again, as with the start measure, the max performance shows greater variance associated with classifications in the gesture case ( =0.8250, p < .0001) than the sentence case ( =0.2736, p < .0001). The difference between these two datasets is not as pronounced as in the start measure, as a linear model shows that only 2.11% (p < .0001) of the variance is associated with the dataset in a linear model predicting max performance observed within a trial. Despite the small value, it is nevertheless significant and driven by the relatively higher performance in the sentence task. The max performance also differs for both sentence ( =0.0042, p < .0001) and gesture tasks ( =0.0722, p < .0001) when the network learns from ordered datasets compared to randomly shuffled ones. The sentence conditions appear to pick up more spurious signals, ultimately approaching 1.00 as the epochs increase, while the gesture condition remains consistently unlearned across epochs. The learning pattern for tmax across epochs (see next section) provides additional insights into these trends. Both sentence and gesture tasks show an increase in max performance over training epochs. On average this asymptotes near perfect performance but can vary depending on binary classification. Both sentence and gesture tasks show an increase in max performance over training epochs. On average this asymptotes near perfect performance but can vary depending on binary classification. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012286.g007 We would expect that completed training in the LSTM should show that maximum performance should appear near the end of an item, as this would suggest that the network has extracted useful information in the whole presentation. Indeed, this is indicated by lower time-at-max values earlier in the training. During the first few epochs, the maximum value occurs proportionally earlier in a training item, similar to the example shown above in Fig 5. However in both sentence and gesture datasets, networks slowly extract features across the stimulus items for classification, as shown in Fig 8. The time gradually rises for all classifications, though it can also vary widely and tends to be more irregular in gesture. In a linear model predicting tmax from data source, sentence and gesture are only slightly different, with 0.34% (p < .0001) of the variance accounted for. Classifications in sentence and gesture both relate significantly in a linear model predicting time at max, with sentence classifications accounting for 9.51% (p < .0001) of the variance and gesture classifications 24.95% (p < .0001). Interpreting tmax alongside max, we confirm that the learning experience of a language task is more reliant on spurious signals for reshuffled data compared to ordered data, as max continuously increases to reach 1.00 while tmax remains sporadic. The gesture condition remains consistently unlearned across epochs for reshuffled data, as the max performance can occur at any point along the processing trajectory (any timestep). Both tmax values indicate that no meaningful delayed signals were developed when the network was trained on superimposed reshuffled data. The time at max differs significantly for reshuffled versus ordered data in both sentence ( =0.0120, p < .0001) and gesture ( =0.0058, p < .0001) conditions. Both sentence and gesture tasks show an increase in the proportion of time at which maximum performance is observed. Indicative of information gain, this rises in both – suggesting the LSTM comes to better integrate the full test items for its performance. However this is much more orderly in the sentence task than the gesture task. Both sentence and gesture tasks show an increase in the proportion of time at which maximum performance is observed. Indicative of information gain, this rises in both – suggesting the LSTM comes to better integrate the full test items for its performance. However this is much more orderly in the sentence task than the gesture task. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012286.g008 Finally, we wish to get a sense of how the LSTM models are extracting information within an information processing session. One way to do this is to discern how much higher its performance is at the end of a session compared to its performance initially. This is where we see the greatest difference between the datasets. As shown as Fig 9, sentence shows substantial information gain across stimulus items. By the end of training, the start and end of trials involves considerable difference, and the positive value of this difference shows that the network improves its performance significantly across presentations. With gesture, the situation is quite distinct. In most classifications, there is indeed a rise. But because gesture is informative even at the first time bin of an item, there isn’t much information gain remaining. Indeed even the highest instances of this value hover near 0.10. Therefore, while performance on gesture is higher at first, the network may find the task more difficult in integrating that spatial information over time to improve performance. As in the start measure, the difference between datasets is quite large. When data source is used to predict the end - start measure, 39.23% (p < .0001) of the observed variance in this measure can be associated with data source, with sentence associated with much higher information gain than gesture results. When looking at each data source separately, only 13.01% (p < .0001) of the measure is associated with the classification pairs in sentence. In the gesture dataset, this association is 38.08% (p < .0001), showing much higher contribution of the class differences in gesture. Both sentence’s (R2 =0.0027, p < .0001) and gesture’s (R2 =0.0340, p < .0001) end-start values differ significantly between ordered and reshuffled data. Consistent with max performance gradually reaching 1.00, the information gain of the sentence network increases incrementally from 0.00 to 0.50 when trained on reshuffled data. Combined with insights from tmax, we suggest that although learning may appear to occur even with reshuffled data, it is likely driven by spurious signals picked up during the processing session. Additionally, the end-start performance for gesture gradually improved from highly negative to slightly negative but was not able to reach 0.00 during the early epochs (e.g. epochs smaller than 50), which explains the flat max performance for the reshuffled gesture condition. The information gain from start to end of stimulus item shows a stark difference between datasets. The sentence task shows that the LSTM’s performance rises as it integrates data from start to end. With gestures, the story is more complicated, showing less improvement overall, and in one classification task, it is almost entirely unlearned. The information gain from start to end of stimulus item shows a stark difference between datasets. The sentence task shows that the LSTM’s performance rises as it integrates data from start to end. With gestures, the story is more complicated, showing less improvement overall, and in one classification task, it is almost entirely unlearned. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012286.g009 Recognizing the importance and challenges involved in systematically unpacking the internal representations of DNNs, this study introduced a multi-dimensional quantification and visualization approach, “learning curves,” which can capture two temporal dimensions of a model learning experience. First, it captures the “information processing trajectory,” how the network is doing as it processes test items. Second, it captures the “developmental trajectory,” describing how this processing is changing over training epochs. The former represents the influence of incoming signals on an agent’s decision-making, which is operationalized by the timestep within a single epoch of an RNN. The latter conceptualizes the gradual improvement in an agent’s decision-making abilities throughout its lifespan, operationalized by the iteration of epochs. The learning curve approach we illustrate in our two datasets shows that we can quantify and qualitatively investigate both of these dynamics within the same analysis, utilizing four descriptive metrics: start, end - start, max, tmax. Based on a series of significant tests (see Table 2), we first demonstrated that there is a data source difference between sentence and gesture classification in the overall learning patterns across all four metrics (all p’s < .0001). Additionally, the learning experiences of both datasets’ ordered classifications are distinct from their respective reshuffled null baselines, except for the start of the sentence classification. This is because both ordered (aggregated across all classes) and unordered binary sentence classifications will have an initial classification performance of 0.50 due to random guessing. This is corroborated by the significant test of the start metric for sentence class and gesture class: sentence pairwise classifications show very minor differences, with R-squared 0.10 (p < .0001), whereas gesture classes show much greater divergence, with R-squared above 0.90 (p < .0001), due to the initial spatial information contained in gesture coordinates, even at timestep 0, as mentioned in the previous results section. The significant difference between the reshuffled null baseline for ordered vs. unordered gesture classification is also due to different gesture class pairs having different prior spatial information, deviating from the 0.50 random guess scenario observed in sentence classification. The modality distinction is further evident in the end - start metric (where sentence classification shows a much larger information gain than gesture classification, with gesture’s information gain is more gradual). Finally, the ANOVA test capturing the R-squared difference between epoch × class versus epoch-only indicates significant distinctions between pairwise classes and not being distinguished by class (all p’s < .0001). This reveals that within the same multiclassification task, certain classes can be more difficult or easier to separate. Taken together, based on the analysis of these four measures derived from the learning curves across two distinct datasets, we highlight three insights gained from mapping these curves: non-monotonicity, pairwise comparisons, and domain distinctions. First, we observed a non-monotonic trend in the learning experiences of DNNs. In other words, learning does not always show an increasing monotonic improvement because networks sometimes reveal temporary decrements in their performance across training. This is a characteristic recognized in previous literature as a key advantage for their advancement in addressing the most challenging tasks. For example, in applying neural network models to language, the presence of non-monotonic learning was taken as evidence that networks “reorganize” their knowledge as they learn. This may mean networks are acquiring more efficient representations of a problem space and the drop in performance is indicative of a transition into that more efficient representation. Classically, in the case of models learning language, they show a decrement in performance when they “discover a rule” in grammars [68] Our results are a testament to the observation that both representational consolidation and “catastrophic forgetting” remain as important issues in DNN learning [69]. Specifically in our results, we found that RNNs exhibit different preferences for early versus late cues when addressing various sequential tasks. For instance, in the sentence task, we noted a more pronounced performance improvement occurring in the later stages of information processing (i.e., model development). In contrast, gesture learning tends to show quicker progress, with more variability across epochs and repetitions of simulations, suggesting that DNNs tend to rely on shortcuts, such as naive cues related to keypoint coordinates, for gesture classification, rather than focusing on high-level movement sequences. This shortcut-based “learning” also is evident in the higher initial performance (start) for gesture classification ( > 0.75). On the other hand, sentence classification begins at around 0.50 (the at-chance probability) and exhibits greater performance gains in later epochs, indicating that the models classify based on high-level semantic sequences. Additionally, although multiclassification tends to exhibit collective model performance, our between-class pairwise comparisons reveal the presence of outliers within multiclassification. For example, “joy/fear”, “surprise/fear”, and “sadness/fear” demonstrate higher information gains across epochs compared to other emotion pairs, suggesting that these classes are further apart from each other. The “body/head” classification appears to experience learning challenges, possibly because these two movements have difficulty being completely separated, as the head’s movement in naturalistic data may inevitably coincide with that of the body due to joint coordination. The combination of learning curve mapping and instance measures thus serves as an effective approach for “auditing” representations in multiclassification problems. The proposed pipeline improves model explainability beyond holistic evaluation of classification performance and ad-hoc attention visualization by unpacking pairwise class learning patterns to reveal any pairs that are unsuccessful in being discriminated or involve delayed knowledge gain. This granular examination allows modelers to better investigate a model’s appropriateness for the underlying task, as well as the properties of the processed input signals, reaffirming the value of our learning curve conceptualization. With these findings, it is tempting to infer that there are domain distinctions among different modality classification tasks. Gesture learning, for instance, may rely on autocorrelated signals (as body movements result from the coordinated contraction and relaxation of muscles), potentially emphasizing spatial semantics as early cues 3, while language learning relies on higher degrees of surprisal, irregularities and arbitrariness, as suggested by previous literature (see [43–46]). These domain distinctions are valuable to cognitive science in understanding how humans process and distinguish between various modes of communication, shedding light on the neural mechanisms underlying the flexibility and adaptability of the human mind when processing different forms of information and communication modalities. Though it is intuitive and tempting to explain these domain distinctions here, we cannot yet assert that these trends would hold for all sentence or gesture (keypoint) classification tasks, only the ones we investigate here. However the learning curve results would seem to align with an intuition of how linguistic symbols would be sequentially integrated into a neural network in contrast to the highly auto-correlated spatial information contained in gesture performance. Still, we cannot infer a broad generalization about “language vs. gesture” and only leave it as a potential path for future investigation. Indeed, this may be an additional benefit of a method like the one we present here. Learning curves could finely ascertain these domain distinctions, and expanding the set of data to test may permit generalization in future work. This may have theoretical implications itself. The learning curve analysis may provide information about the distinct sources of information from varied modalities. When neural models (or human brains, presumably) integrate distinctive sources of information, they may strengthen understanding of complex multimodal data by leveraging their unique information-processing and developmental benefits. This study provides conceptual and operational illustrations of applying learning curve methods to RNNs, though both the illustration and the proposed method come with certain considerations. First, we selected two distinct datasets to demonstrate how learning curves offer insights into different data and modality learning experiences. While illustrating significant domain distinctions, our study is limited in making broad generalizations between “language vs. behavioral.” Future cognitive and behavioral research interested in such conceptual generalization can apply our proposed method to various distinct language tasks (e.g., language translation) and behavioral datasets (e.g., facial expression detection) to achieve broader generalizations across different modalities. Additionally, as highlighted at the beginning, our method could have implications for multimodal DNN modeling, given that our simulations utilize datasets with distinct modalities. For the current scope, we focus on how our proposed method facilitates the understanding of distinguishable modalities as an initial step, while future work can explore adopting this method for multimodal DNNs and datasets (e.g., audiovisual emotion classification) to assess how multimodal learning differs from unimodal learning. From a methodological standpoint, as detailed in the model explainability technique comparison (Table 1), our proposed method is currently limited to temporal tasks and DNN architectures, specifically RNNs. However, it has the potential to be relatively easily adapted to various tasks, modalities, multiclassification, and different performance measures, beyond the binary classification used in this study. We have provided illustrations of the multiclassification learning curve based on sentence classification in S2 Text. Additionally, because our method generates measures at every timestep and epoch, it may be more computationally expensive compared to other explainability methods. However, this arises from the tradeoff between obtaining a more granular measure across all training steps versus only obtaining snapshot visualizations of a single neural network layer or attribution scores for all input features. As documented in the DNN explainability comparison (Table 1), each technique has its strengths and considerations, and researchers can exercise discretion in choosing the appropriate method. The learning curve method excels in providing a more systematic understanding of the model’s learning process across models and modalities. There is a long tradition in cognitive science and computational neuroscience of examining the internal representations of models [9–12]. One reason for this is to determine if a model’s features or processes reflect processes of the human mind. Such models can be informative for inferring properties of human mental processing, and so have direct theoretical implications. For example, Elman [13] and others [14] showed that RNNs can learn patterns sufficiently complex to resemble human grammar. By examining the internal activations of these recurrent networks, they showed that these systems are driven by graded, statistical features. Words are not discrete “symbols” but scalar vectors conditioned by linguistic context in time [15]. This was taken to challenge theories that see language as a purely abstract and symbolic recursive process [16]. Inspired by prior work, the learning curve method we proposed uses temporal mapping (information processing and developmental trajectories) to help modelers more comprehensively understand the underlying learning and decision-making processes of a complex model architecture without delving into the intricacies of interpreting its internal representations directly [23, 38]. This kind of systematic and quantitative approach has recently gained popularity in both computational cognitive science and deep learning communities [5, 38, 63–65], as it facilitates multidimensional comparisons across models and modalities, which were previously seen as challenging for DNN-like models. The current study illustrates multiple techniques for analyzing model learning experiences and highlights three insights across different communication modalities based on these analyses. Future studies can utilize this learning curve mapping approach to enhance model interpretability studies by evaluating a model’s appropriateness for the task at hand, examining the properties of the underlying input signals, and assessing the model’s alignment (or lack thereof) with human learning experiences, which is also a critical consideration for computational cognitive science and neuroscience research.

Title: McDonald's earnings miss due to E. Coli outbreak and a decline in consumer spending

McDonald’s customers aren’t “lovin’ it.” The fast-food giant missed Wall Street’s expectations for the fourth quarter, largely due to the lingering effects of an E. coli outbreak and ongoing inflation pressures. The October incident sickened hundreds of customers and caused a massive drop in foot traffic, leading to a decline in same-store sales. In early trading, McDonald’s shares were slightly up. “Our fourth-quarter performance reflects the impact of the food incident,” CEO Chris Kempczinski said during the company’s Feb. 10 earnings call. The Illinois-based company reported revenue of $6.39 billion, missing Wall Street’s forecast of $6.44 billion in revenue, while earnings per share came in at $2.80 — meeting expectations. Additionally, U.S. same-store sales fell 1.4% year-over-year, surpassing the Street’s modest projection of 0.6%. The impact of the E. Coli outbreak, which began in late Oct. 2024, has started to reveal the toll it took on McDonald’s performance. Citi analyst Jon Tower said in a research note that he believes the outbreak marked the company’s “low point” and sees the coming quarter as “setting the table” for a recovery. However, inflation remains a challenge and is expected to persist in the near future. Jan. 2025 was another tough month for McDonald’s, despite optimism surrounding its McValue platform. BTIG analyst Peter Saleh noted that severe weather conditions across the U.S. complicated efforts to determine whether the value menu had increased foot traffic. In a note covering the restaurant industry, Bank of America set a 12-month price target of $312 for McDonald’s, reflecting steady growth expectations despite the challenges of its franchised business model. In Nov. 2024, the company announced a $100 million investment to support marketing efforts and franchisee operations. About 95% of U.S. locations are run by franchisees. BoA highlighted both upside and downside risks: Stronger-than-expected sales and cost savings could boost McDonald’s stock, while slow sales and margin pressure from inflation could weigh on its performance. According to foot-traffic analytics firm Placer.ai, inflation likely contributed to dips in McDonald’s visits, while budget-conscious consumers flocked to limited-time offers and special releases. The company has capitalized on this trend, driving significant foot traffic with the June launch of its $5 Meal Deal. Additionally, the Chicken Big Mac, introduced in Oct. 2024, drove a 7.2% increase in visits during its first week. The promotions help McDonald’s maintain its relevance. The company recently launched a “McValue” menu, expanding on its $5 meal deal. It’s also bringing back the Shamrock Shake. Other nostalgic promotions, such as collector’s cups relaunched in Aug. 2024, have proven extremely successful. The cups were so popular that customers resold them on third-party websites such as eBay for as much as $100 each. Elsewhere, McDonald’s also made headlines in Oct. 2024 when President Donald Trump staged a cook shift at a Pennsylvania location. The company quickly clarified it had no involvement in the event, noting that it was not “red or blue, but golden.” In Jan. 2025, McDonald’s announced it would scale back its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts, joining the likes of Google, Meta, and Walmart — but not Costco.

Title: NVO CLASS ACTION: Novo Nordisk 18% Stock Drop Triggers Class Action -- Contact BFA Law before March 25 Deadline (NYSE:NVO)

February 10, 2025 08:33 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Novo Nordisk, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/novo-nordisk-as. Investors have until March 25, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and is captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, et al., No. 25-cv-00713. Why was Novo Nordisk Sued for Securities Fraud? Novo Nordisk is a healthcare company focused on the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products globally. During the relevant period, Novo Nordisk was conducting its highly anticipated Phase 3 study, REDEFINE-1, for CagriSema, an investigational drug developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Novo Nordisk discussed REDEFINE-1’s trial protocol and anticipated results, stating that, after a dose escalation period, participants receiving CagriSema were to receive a once-weekly maintenance dosage of 2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide for the remainder of the trial period. In truth, REDEFINE-1 employed a flexible dosing design that left it to patient discretion to choose both their maintenance dose and any decision to lower the dosing during the trial. This undisclosed trial design introduced a heightened risk that jeopardized the Company’s ability to achieve its anticipated results The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On December 20, 2024, Novo Nordisk announced that CagriSema had missed its expected average weight loss target at the conclusion of the REDEFINE-1 trial. The Company attributed its diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol whereby patients were able to “modify their dosing throughout the trial.” This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients taking the contemplated maintenance dose at the end of the trial. On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock declined roughly 18% during the course of the trading day, from a closing price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024 to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024.

Title: Forbes Daily: New Steel Tariffs Are Trump’s Latest Trade Escalation

Today’s Forbes Daily newsletter covers buy now, pay later fintech Sezzle, how Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie made his fortune, the latest jobs data and a conversation with actor Issa Rae. The next time you see higher prices at the grocery store, there could be an unexpected culprit: a bee shortage. In an unprecedented event, bees died off by the millions this winter, resulting in financial losses of more than $139 million, according to a new survey. The bee industry is in full panic as California’s almond season is set to begin, which requires most of the country’s 3 million honey bee colonies to pollinate the trees. And it’s not just almonds that will be affected: Bees are needed to pollinate fruits like blueberries, cherries, cranberries and apples. There’s no known cause for this recent colony collapse. “We’ve seen tough times in the bee business before, but this one seems to be a different flavor,” one beekeeper told Forbes. A worker at an aluminum profile production company in Binzhou, Shandong province, China in 2024. President Donald Trump plans to announce new tariffs Monday of 25% on all imports of steel and aluminum, and shares of steelmaker U.S. Steel and aluminum producer Alcoa surged in pre-market trading early Monday. Trump also said his promised “reciprocal tariffs” will be announced Tuesday, and reiterated that he still intends to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico after pausing the implementation of those taxes by 30 days last week. MORE: Trump said Japan’s Nippon Steel agreed to drop its nearly $15 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel Friday and will “heavily” invest in the company instead, after the yearlong merger deal faced bipartisan opposition. Facing bigger and better-funded competitors like Affirm and Klarna, Minneapolis-based buy-now, pay-later fintech Sezzle needed a new revenue source and strategy. CEO and cofounder Charlie Youakim found both by focusing on heavy users: chronic buy-now, pay-later addicts. Sezzle launched a $12.99-a-month subscription service aimed at these frequent fliers, with benefits like access to more retailers and flexibility in rescheduling payments. Billionaire Bill Ackman disclosed Friday his hedge fund made a major bet on ride-hailing giant Uber, helping boost shares of the San Francisco-based company to their highest level in months despite a rollercoaster week. Ackman’s assessment of Uber reflects a growing consensus that the long-time cash-burning business has actually grown to be one of the cheapest big stocks compared to its bottom line. In the first jobs report since Trump’s inauguration, the U.S. added fewer jobs than expected in the weakest start to a year for overall job growth since before the Covid-19 pandemic. Still, other data points revealed a resilient labor market, and the unemployment rate last month was a better-than-expected 4%. Two of the biggest police surveillance companies in the U.S., Axon Enterprise and Flock Safety, are ending a long-standing partnership, in what’s become a bitter, public spat. Cops are already fretting about what the bust-up could mean for law enforcement: One police drone pilot in New Jersey told Forbes that when companies like Axon and Flock don’t work together, it ends up costing cops more. Just months after raising $1.5 billion at a $14 billion valuation, defense tech giant Anduril is in talks to raise another funding round that would value it at $28 billion, Forbes learned Friday. News of the talks comes amid a froth of investor interest in tech companies developing national security products to peddle to the Pentagon. President Donald Trump shocked world leaders last week with his proposal to transform Gaza from a “hellhole” into the “Riviera of the Middle East”, but it’s not the first time Trump has floated luxury development as an urban revitalization tool. It was the late 1970s when Trump became intrigued by Atlantic City, but his casino and hotel empire there was swamped by debt, leading to bankruptcies by the early 1990s. Trump said Sunday night he has ordered the Treasury Secretary to stop minting new pennies, citing the cost of production for the coin, which has been higher than its face value for nearly two decades. It is unclear if the president will be able to act unilaterally to halt the coin’s production or if it would require legislation from Congress. Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie celebrates with the Lombardi Trophy after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs during Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome on February 9, 2025 in New Orleans. Jeffrey Lurie mortgaged his family fortune to buy the struggling Philadelphia Eagles in 1994. Now, after their decisive 40-22 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX, Philadelphia is one of the NFL’s most valuable franchises and a two-time champion. As one of Hollywood’s busiest multi­hyphenates, Issa Rae has parlayed a film and television career into a jewelry collection, a haircare company, a Prosecco brand—just to name a few. Despite her budding empire, Rae, who portrayed Presi­dent Barbie in 2023’s Barbie, insists she doesn’t have a master plan. “It happened organically, and it happened because these were things that we were all already doing,” she says. President Donald Trump temporarily reinstated the “de minimis” loophole that allows packages from China valued at under $800 to be processed without customs duties or tariffs, but his new executive order signed Friday states the exemption will cease for good upon further review by the new U.S. commerce secretary. The change had prompted confusion among e-commerce retailers, shipping companies and Customs and Border Protection, leading the U.S. Postal Service to briefly suspend acceptance of packages from China. Echoing earlier statements, Trump has proposed ending a tax break used by private equity fund managers known as the carried-interest “loophole,” a move Barack Obama and Joe Biden also supported. Carried interest is the percentage of private equity investment profits that a fund manager or venture capitalist receives as compensation for their investment, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that ending the loophole could reduce the federal deficit by $13 billion through 2034. “Every time Marc [Lore] has a new company, it's more and more ambitious, and if he pulls it off, it’s just a bigger story," says Accel partner Sameer Gandhi, who has invested in several of Lore's companies. TOPLINE Serial entrepreneur Marc Lore has dabbled in everything from e-commerce to baseball cards, and Forbes estimates such ventures have now made him worth $2.8 billion. Lore spent six years at three banks before quitting to start a company—any company. He and two childhood friends came up with the Pit, an online trading card marketplace they sold in 2001 for $6 million. After becoming a new parent, Lore dropped out of Wharton to cofound Diapers.com, which Amazon bought in 2010 for $500 million in cash, then reportedly shut down in 2017. Next was Jet.com, an e-commerce take on Costco that Walmart bought for $3.3 billion in 2016 and shuttered in 2020. Lore stayed on to run the retail giant’s online arm until 2021. Later that year, he teamed up with retired New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez on a deal to buy the Minnesota Timberwolves and the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx for about $1.5 billion—to be paid in four installments through 2024. The third installment ended up in arbitration, with a decision expected today. Lore’s latest gamble? Wonder, which bills itself as “a new kind of food hall.” He founded it in 2018 and took the reins as CEO after he left Walmart. The original idea was to purchase recipes and branding from trendy restaurants and celebrity chefs, cook meals in central kitchens, then deliver them in oven-equipped vans, though in early 2023, he swapped Wonder’s 450 vans for delivery-focused storefronts, losing $80 million in the process. It now has 35 locations and $470 million in revenue—a long way from Wonder’s dreamy predictions of $2 billion in sales this year and a $40 billion IPO in 2028. But given Lore’s track record, who would bet against him? WHY IT MATTERS “If you’re reading this from New York or New Jersey, chances are, you’ve seen an advertisement for Wonder,” says Forbes reporter Phoebe Liu. “How does a serial tech entrepreneur known for building, scaling and selling big businesses realize that he wants to spend 100 hours a week changing the way we think about dinner? What makes Marc Lore believe he can succeed in an industry where so many—notably including Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick—have struggled to turn a profit? For any aspiring entrepreneur, there’s something to take away from Lore’s story.” MORE How Daily Border Crossings Helped Turn This Mexican American Into A Billionaire The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program, or VITA, provides free tax filing assistance to underserved communities.

Title: Shock and Awe Miscellany, 2/10/25

President Trump has been thinking outside the box, unleashing Elon Musk with his army of young tech prodigies, and doing what he said he would. His opponents are overwhelmed, and even his supporters cannot always get their heads around what he is doing. So here is a special Shock and Awe Miscellany. . . Do we really want Gaza? How can tariffs help our economy? Slashing the government. President Trump has had his eye on Canada and Greenland, hoping to make America great again by means of territorial acquisition. Whether or not that should be pursued, I can see the attraction of Greenland, with its immense mineral wealth and strategic location, and Canada, a developed Western nation that would be the equivalent in population and liberalism of a California North. But now the president has another territory he would like for the United States to have: Gaza, the 25 mile long by 3.7 to 7.5 mile wide strip of land bordering Israel, the Mediterranean Sea, and Egypt. Which is the site of the bloody war between Israel and Hamas. My question is, WHY? After a meeting with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu, who is open to the idea, President Trump said this, according to the transcript: “I also strongly believe that the Gaza Strip, which has been a symbol of death and destruction for so many decades and so bad for the people anywhere near it, and especially those who live there and frankly who’s been really very unlucky. It’s been very unlucky. It’s been an unlucky place for a long time. “Being in its presence just has not been good and it should not go through a process of rebuilding and occupation by the same people that have really stood there and fought for it and lived there and died there and lived a miserable existence there. Instead, we should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction and frankly bad luck. “This can be paid for by neighbouring countries of great wealth. It could be one, two, three, four, five, seven, eight, 12. It could be numerous sites, or it could be one large site. But the people will be able to live in comfort and peace and we’ll make sure something really spectacular is done. “They’re going to have peace. They’re not going to be shot at and killed and destroyed like this civilisation of wonderful people has had to endure. The only reason the Palestinians want to go back to Gaza is they have no alternative. It’s right now a demolition site. This is just a demolition site. Virtually every building is down. “They’re living under fallen concrete that’s very dangerous and very precarious. They instead can occupy all of a beautiful area with homes and safety and they can live out their lives in peace and harmony instead of having to go back and do it again. “The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area … do a real job, do something different. America’s top three trading partners, combining both imports and exports, are Mexico ($798 billion), Canada ($773 billion), and China ($575 billion). Together, they account for 42% of America’s trade. Last week, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on goods coming in from Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariff on goods coming in from China. Those countries have vowed to retaliate with tariffs against American products. The reason the president gave for hitting our allies, with whom we have a free trade agreement negotiated by President Trump himself, over twice as hard as our adversary China, is that Mexico and Canada are not doing enough to stop illegal immigrants from crossing their borders into the U.S. Also that those porous borders are letting in the deadly drug Fentanyl. At this action, the stock market plunged, since the U.S. economy is highly dependent on world trade, both imports for our supply chains and consumer goods and exports, to sell U.S. products. But by the end of the week, both Mexico and Canada agreed to put 10,000 troops along the border to deter illegal immigrants and Fentanyl smuggling. So the president paused the tariffs for 30 days. So perhaps the threat of the tariffs was just the president throwing the nation’s weight around, a way to force countries to comply with our demands. And yet, President Trump likes tariffs, calling them “the greatest things ever invented,” and the duty on China’s products remains and is likely to go higher. (He earlier proposed a 60% tariff on China.) My question is, how would it be possible to implement such tariffs without triggering massive inflation? Importers always add the duty fees to the cost of the product. That would inflate the prices of just about everything Americans buy on Walmart and Amazon. But that’s not all. If tariffs are successful in limiting the amount of imports, so that more people “buy American,” the drop in overall supply plus the greater demand for domestically-produced goods will also send prices higher. The hope is that tariffs will help American manufacturing, but American industries are highly dependent on other countries for raw materials and parts necessary for their supply line. In time, the American economy could probably adjust, but that will take a long and painful time. Meanwhile, the loss of foreign markets for American products can only mean hard times for our companies, layoffs for our workers, and hardship for our farmers. Is there a way that high tariffs (traditionally a policy favored by liberal Democrats) could possibly help the American economy? To his credit, President Trump is slashing the overgrown federal government. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, is decimating the federal work force and is eliminating entire agencies. To those who complain that no one elected Musk, I would say that no one elected the IRS agent who collected my taxes or the TSA agent who screened me at the airport. They were simply acting by virtue of the authority given to them by the Executive Branch of the government, under the auspices of the President of the United States. Musk is acting on the authority of the democratically-elected president, who is the head of said Executive Branch. One casualty was the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which was completely eliminated, with its foreign aid function transferred to the State Department. Observes John Daniel Davidson, “In the six decades since it was established, USAID has gone from fighting poverty, spreading American ideals, and undercutting Soviet propaganda, to becoming a woke propaganda operation of its own that actively undermines the pillars of western civilization. . . .Everywhere you look in the USAID database, you see projects promoting LGBTQ ideology, mass immigration, multiculturalism, DEI, climate change-ism, and the like. You see programs that undermine the traditional family, that enable anti-free speech censorship, that strive to make the rest of the world just like urban liberal enclaves in the U.S.” He cites some of the grants: “$70,000 for a ‘DEI musical’ in Ireland, $47,000 for a ‘transgender opera’ in Colombia, $32,000 for a ‘transgender comic book’ in Peru, and $1.5 million for an LGBT jobs program in Serbia.” (Go here for more.) In a bigger move, all federal workers were offered a buyout of eight months severance and benefits. If they don’t, they risk losing their jobs as part of a reduction in force. So far, some 60,000 have accepted, about 3% of the federal workforce, though the overall goal is to cut the number of employees by 5%-10%. One agency offering buyouts to its entire workforce is the CIA. Though most national security personnel were exempt from the cutbacks, the new CIA Director John Ratcliffe decided to apply it to his clandestine domain. Granted, that institution has been guilty of hugely consequential intelligence failures (e.g., Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan) and scandalous political interventions (e.g., the Russiagate scandal, the Hunter Biden laptop coverup). A house cleaning is certainly in order. But if some agents or their handlers decide to take early retirement from their dangerous work, can we risk losing our spy networks in places like China, Russia, and Iran? Shouldn’t the pruning, for the CIA and elsewhere, be more targeted? UPDATE: A federal judge has paused the buyouts.

Title: CoinEx Research January 2025 Report: Trumpian Bitcoin Amid Alts Anxiety

February 10, 2025 06:00 ET | Source: CoinEx CoinEx HONG KONG, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoinEx Research's January 2025 report highlights a volatile month that is shaped by political developments, institutional participation, and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin surged past $100,000 to reach a new all-time high, while altcoins struggled due to liquidity drained by Trump-related tokens. The emergence of China’s DeepSeek AI model further unsettled global tech and crypto markets, leading to a valuation reset. Institutional Bitcoin adoption continued to gain traction, but a late-month pullback raised concerns about potential market consolidation. A Volatile Start to 2025Bitcoin opened the year at approximately $92,500 and closed near $102,000, demonstrating resilience despite a turbulent macroeconomic backdrop. The Federal Reserve maintained interest rates at 4.25%–4.50%, citing a strong labour market and persistent inflation, while the Bank of Japan raised its policy rate from 0.25% to 0.50%. The launch of the Official Trump Memecoin and Trump-linked World Liberty Finance (WLFI) captured market attention, but their liquidity absorption limited altcoin growth. Given the current conditions, Bitcoin may enter a near-term consolidation phase due to the lack of immediate bullish catalysts. The Trump Effect: Memecoins and DeFi Expansion Donald Trump’s influence in the crypto market grew significantly ahead of his inauguration. His team launched the Official Trump Memecoin on Solana’s Meteora platform, bypassing traditional SOL-based liquidity providers like Raydium. This decision helped push Solana’s stablecoin supply beyond $9 billion, a 130% increase, and drove Solana’s DEX trading volume to an all-time high of $258 billion, three times that of Ethereum. The memecoin’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) exceeded $70 billion at its peak, surpassing leading memecoins such as SHIB, PEPE, and WIF. The speculative rally continued with the surprise launch of the Melania Token by First Lady Melania Trump, further intensifying trading activity. However, back-to-back token launches exhausted market liquidity, leading to an eventual pullback. Meanwhile, the Trump-linked World Liberty Finance (WLFI), a DeFi project on Ethereum, successfully raised over $300 million in its presale. This signaled that the Trump crypto narrative extended beyond memecoins to include institutional-style DeFi products, blending speculative and financial elements. DeepSeek AI’s Disruptive Impact on Global Markets China’s DeepSeek AI model, launched just before the Lunar New Year, sent shockwaves through global AI and financial markets. With a training cost significantly lower than its Western counterparts—DeepSeek introduced a cost-efficient alternative powered by a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. This method optimizes computational efficiency by selectively activating only the most relevant sub-networks per query. DeepSeek’s debut triggered a major sell-off in U.S. tech stocks, with Nvidia (NVDA) plummeting 17% in a single day as investors reassessed the competitive landscape. AI-themed crypto tokens also suffered heavy losses due to broader risk-off sentiment. However, rather than being a structural threat, DeepSeek’s emergence represents a necessary market recalibration that could accelerate AI adoption and unlock new crypto-related opportunities. Source: LiveBench Institutional Bitcoin Adoption and Policy Shifts Institutional participation in Bitcoin remained strong in January, supported by major policy developments. SEC Acting Chair Mark Uyeda established a crypto task force, and President Trump signed an executive order in his first week promoting crypto innovation, signaling a shift toward broader adoption. In Illinois, lawmakers advanced a bill to create a state Bitcoin reserve, following Arizona’s move to integrate cryptocurrency into public finance. Outside the U.S., sovereign institutions also increased their Bitcoin exposure. The Czech Central Bank approved Bitcoin for inclusion in its national reserves, while Norway’s Sovereign Wealth Fund disclosed a 150% year-on-year increase in its Bitcoin holdings, now exceeding $350 million. These moves highlighted a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value among government treasuries and institutional investors. Stablecoin Inflows and Market Caution Stablecoins continued to see strong inflows, with approximately $9.9 billion entering the market in January. This sustained a three-month trend of capital influx, supporting the bullish structure of the market. Bitcoin’s new all-time highs coincided with these inflows, reinforcing the importance of stablecoin liquidity in market momentum. However, despite the positive trend, a notable market pullback in late January suggests a cautious outlook. If stablecoin inflows slow or turn into net outflows, the market could face a period of consolidation, leading to increased volatility. Investors should closely monitor stablecoin trends as an indicator of broader market sentiment. Market Outlook for February 2025 Looking ahead, the market’s direction in February will be shaped by institutional developments, regulatory policies, and stablecoin movements. Traders and investors should remain vigilant, adjusting their strategies in response to evolving macroeconomic conditions and liquidity trends.

Title: Meta to Lay Off 5% of Employees Starting Today, Initiating Performance-Based Terminations

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, will begin issuing layoff notices starting today. These job cuts, referred to as 'performance terminations,' will primarily target the lowest-performing 5% of employees. Unlike previous layoffs, Meta plans to keep its offices open on the day of the cuts and will not release a company-wide statement. #News Meta to lay off about 4,000 employees due to poor performance Social media giant #Meta will reportedly layoff 3,600 employees this year, according to recent filings. The company is terminating staff based on their poor performance and says they will hire new workers to… pic.twitter.com/hC7kgTbm9A — Christina Aguayo (@ChristinaNewstv) January 16, 2025 The layoffs will be global, but employees in Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands are exempt due to local regulations. Notifications will be sent to staff across over a dozen countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa between February 11 and February 18. ALSO SEE: Realme P3 Pro To Launch With Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 Chipset; AI-powered GT Boost Expected Meta had earlier confirmed plans to cut around 5% of its workforce, targeting "lowest performers," with some positions to be refilled. In a memo, these cuts were labeled as “performance terminations,” a term initially reported by The Information. Unlike prior company-wide layoffs, Meta will keep its offices open on Monday and will not provide additional details about the decisions, according to a memo from Janelle Gale, Meta’s Head of People. In a separate memo posted on Friday, Peng Fan, Meta’s VP of Engineering for Monetization, urged employees to support an expedited hiring process for machine learning engineers and other "business-critical" engineering roles. This accelerated hiring initiative is set to run from February 11 to March 13. Meta decided to layoff 3,600 employees citing low-performance. On the surface, it is about efficiency. But, what’s the deeper narrative? - Is performance the issue or experience in a volatile tech climate? - Are companies losing sight of long-term impact in favor of short-term… pic.twitter.com/cTHscYUar7 — Vikas (@vikaspar_) February 8, 2025 The trend of job cuts extends beyond Meta, with tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Stripe, and Robinhood also reducing their workforce in 2025. Google initiated a voluntary exit program in its U.S. Platforms and Devices team, affecting Android and Pixel. Microsoft focused on performance-based terminations, some without severance. Amazon cut 200 jobs in fashion and fitness divisions, realigning its North America Stores team. Stripe laid off 300 employees in product, engineering, and operations, despite plans to grow its workforce by 17% by year-end. Robinhood's media arm, Sherwood, also downsized as part of a restructuring.

Title: T-Mobile Opens Cellular Starlink Beta to AT&T and Verizon Users, Reveals Pricing

T-Mobile said today that customers on its most expensive Go5G Next plan will receive access to satellite-to-phone connectivity via SpaceX's Starlink as a free perk starting in July. On all other plans, it will be $15 per month per line. The interesting part is that T-Mobile also plans on offering the Starlink connectivity to AT&T and Verizon customers, who will pay $20 per month per line. They will only need a compatible and unlocked smartphone that supports eSIMs, says Clint Patterson, T-Mobile's SVP of marketing. "They add a second SIM to the phone" to get cellular Starlink, Patterson says. The T-Mobile-Starlink eSIM can then be used to receive satellite-based SMS messaging in areas without ground-based cell coverage. T-Mobile published an online list of supported phones, which will be updated over time with more device models. "We've done a lot of work with OEMs and handset providers. So this will work on most smartphones from the last four years," Patterson says. "When you see that list, you'll see things like Galaxy S21 and later, iPhone 14 and later." T-Mobile plans to officially launch its cellular Starlink service in July, when a free test beta announced in December ends. The carrier revealed the news in a Super Bowl commercial about T-Mobile's partnership with SpaceX. The resulting “space-based network,” spanning over 400 satellites, is capable of beaming data to unmodified smartphones on the ground, giving consumers a way to receive a signal even in a cellular dead zone. Last month, the carrier invited select T-Mobile users on newer iPhones, Samsung Galaxy and Pixel devices to try out the satellite connectivity. The Super Bowl ad takes things further, with T-Mobile confirming it’ll expand the free beta program to "anyone on any wireless carrier." The offer lasts until July. For now, the satellite connectivity only supports SMS-based text messaging in dead zones. But over time, SpaceX plans on rolling out support for voice calls and data downloads, pending some regulatory lobbying. In July, business customers will also get T-Mobile Starlink at no extra cost on Go 5G Business Next, first responder agencies on T-Priority plans, and other select premium rate plans. The move to include rival carriers is sure to turn heads since AT&T and Verizon are both pursuing their own satellite ventures through AST SpaceMobile and Skylo, respectively. But in AST’s case, the company still remains months away at best from offering the satellite-to-phone service to mainstream consumers. (T-Mobile says it didn’t initially plan to open Starlink’s cellular service to users on rival carriers. But that changed after Verizon aired a big-budget commercial last week touting its own satellite-to-phone capabilities.) As for SpaceX, the company received FCC clearance in November to commercially operate the cellular Starlink service. The license permits SpaceX to use T-Mobile’s radio spectrum in the 1900MHz block to beam the satellite connectivity to certified devices. The latest phones from Apple, Samsung, and Google have received an FCC Part 25 Supplement Coverage from Space certification. Hence, T-Mobile should be able to beam the satellite data connectivity to them, even though they may be running on another carrier’s network. T-Mobile customers with iPhones and Galaxy devices have already tried out the cellular Starlink service through the beta program. It has enabled them to send SMS text messages in remote areas in the US, but the signal quality isn’t always consistent. "It does drop signal quite often. You do get a notification when you are connected, though,” one beta tester told PCMag. That said, SpaceX is preparing to launch hundreds of additional cellular Starlink satellites, which promise to boost the signal quality. In a statement, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said: “We’re still in the early days — I don’t want to overhype the experience during a beta test — but we’re officially putting ‘no bars’ on notice. Dead zones, your days are numbered at the Un-carrier.” In terms of pricing, the $15 and $20 monthly fees may be high for consumers, especially if they don’t live near any cellular dead zones. But T-Mobile is offering an early adopter discount to its own subscribers through this month that cuts the price to $10 per month per line. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017. I've been following SpaceX's Starlink network for several years, writing 500+ stories on availability and feature launches, but also the regulatory battles over the expansion of satellite constellations, fights between rival providers, and the effort to expand into satellite-based mobile service.
